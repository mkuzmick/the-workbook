## plan

### people
* staff lead: JK

### goals
to communicate ideas effectively using not only words but also graphics, layout, and design. Final posters need the following elements:

o   Title: The title of your policy proposal and name of group members.

o   Introduction: Brief overview of the issue your policy addresses.

o   Background: Key facts about the psychology and science of music relevant to your proposal.

o   Policy Description: A succinct explanation of your proposed policy and its benefits.

o   Call to Action: A compelling statement encouraging the viewer to support your policy.

o   Visual Elements: Include relevant graphs, charts, images, or other visual aids to enhance your message and maintain viewer interest.

o   Presentation: Plan a 10-minute presentation of your poster where each group member discusses a section of the poster. There is no need to submit this presentation plan. Just be prepared to discuss your poster with guests who stop by to hear your proposal.
