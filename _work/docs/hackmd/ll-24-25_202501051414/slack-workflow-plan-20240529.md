# slack-workflow-plan-20240529

There are an array of slack channels that folks will interact with, of the following categories: `#util-`, `#project-`, `#people-`, and `#lab-`.

## #util-
`#util-`:  these channels are for saving and logging work. there could 100x messages per day in these channels, so they are not galleries or views, they're simply for storage (like saving xml) or getting a public link to an image (like in #util-img-2-md).
* **slack channel type**: private (*public but not published*)
* **bot functions**: parsing/making sense, and tagging in airtable

## #project-
`#project-`: these channels are for planning, reporting, admin tasks and deadlines associated with a project or a cluster of projects.
* **slack channel type**: private (*public but not published*)
* **bot function**s: project reporting bots

## #people-

group channels (`#ll-mdfs-24-25`, `#ll-llufs-24-25`) will be used for announcements and such.

`#ll-role-firstname-lastinitial-admin`: these channels are for purely administrative purposes (HR-type things, like absences, general questions, etc.).
* **slack channel type**: private (fully)
* **bot functions**: none

`#ll-role-firstname-lastinitial-updates:` these channels are for updates for individual LL members, for inputting anything and everything that can help tell the story of what they're doing in their role. (note: each person is responsible for making sure to add all the things they want to have included in the story of their work to their individual updates channel, even when other planning has taken place in project-specific channels!) 
* **slack channel type**: public
* **bot functions**: updates bot

## #lab-
`#lab-`: these channels are large channels for ideas and discussion around a specific topic. throughout the years, these topic channels have had various prefixes, including `#lab-`, `#medium-`, `#form-`, `#tool-`, `#buzz-`, and sometime even no prefix. the goal is for our top channels of the year to be alive and active: folks are encouraged to think and discuss in these channels, to add links with commentary, and to engage with what others are writing.
* **slack channel type**: *public*
* **bot functions**: 1) bots will be used to pull from the #work- and #project- channels and add things to the relevant lab channels. 2) bots will also be used for writing in these channels, keeping the discussion going, etc.
