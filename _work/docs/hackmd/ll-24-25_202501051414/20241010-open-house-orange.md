## station planning 

overlap with red on the basics, what it does well and not. 
- introduce advanced tools such as Custom GPTs as ways of trying to constrain or control the output in more effective ways
- idea of multi-agent and chain-of-thought prompting hinted at (learn more at yellow and green)
- but this leads to issues surrounding access, cost, energy use => papers on energy consumption
- activity = make a custom GPT
