## Generative AI for Educators Demo
This project involves creating a hands-on demonstration of generative AI tools aimed at faculty clients, introducing them to the functionalities and potential uses of generative AI in their curriculum. Students will build and teach interactive demonstrations, based on ongoing LL AI offerings. These presentations can be demonstrated to our MDFs, so students can practice teaching in a low-stakes environment with graduate-level fellows experienced in multimedia pedagogy. Studentsâ€™ final capstone may take the form of a studio installation, online gallery, or workshop.
