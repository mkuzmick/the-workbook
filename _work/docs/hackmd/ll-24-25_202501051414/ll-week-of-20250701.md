# ll-week-of-20250701

## single for the week: singles and signposts
* slack channel: #ll-project-signals-and-signposts

## ai support
* message has gone out from higher ups so hopefully hearing back soon
* if specific ideas, maybe informal reachouts (re: Rachelle & alexa)
* decide about reaching out to other courses this month
* draft for bill - we didn't relaly know which way precisiely you wanted to take these things, we'd love your feedback etc.
* start getting ready for other AI things in the fall - come up with some things we want to build or get ready

## space/system
* mk/dd talk about airtable bases for next year
* chris to be working with sophie and casey on unreal
* and cd and jk to be working with OBS on all the things they're making
* blue can work on cleaning and space base 
* mk/dd to come up with a task list today of non-urgent space things
    * for the ethernet cables in the corner that were run: there are 4 cables that are all the same legnth. 2 black ones we can leave for cameras in the corner. but the blue and yellow ones: pull back out of the snake, and allow to be coiled right at the main truss node
    * tidy the 25' -50' or so ethernets running from the system over to the brick wall.
        * two go out to windowsill camera
        * one goes (more neatly) to overhead camera
        * add additional overhead camera and send one there too
        * one goes to a camera on a high-hat with quite a bit of available slack that can sit on the blue toolbox
        * one goes to the wall from the 10gig switch (already done but we can think of ways of tidying)
        * one goes from wall to slower switch (already done? make sure there isn't one between switches)
        * one goes from 10gig switch to Mac Pro
        * one stays ready to go from 10gig switch to a mac studio on brick wall side (and we can add this in if we want)
    * two mini studio cameras can go as overhead in small studio and as an overhead in the classroom
    * drill through a black shelf to mount small-ish pan-tilt heads (make sure room for two cams or else drill evenly spaced out)
    * if we have long enough ethernet cables left to reach these cameras (going across the middle is fine) then we can do taht


## fall prep
* jk work on lluf policy for next year
