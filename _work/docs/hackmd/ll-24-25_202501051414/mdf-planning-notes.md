## 20240517 messy notes
* idea that we move towards them writing something more naturally in slack and then we parse it
* meetings could be where a lot of the reporting stuff happens, since training based on their project charters will be more individualized
* this summer we should think about how to build the system that gets us from slack and people talking to what we need
* overdoing it in slacks
    * people-related channels
        * for next year, we'd like a new ll-central (rename the old one, create a new one.)
    * project-specific channels that map on to books/docs/etc.
    * lab channels related to ongoing interesting focal points (more discussion of ideas)
    * work channels for undergrads and staff that are working with a given tools (more like the factory zone)
    * utils are utilities
* mk/dd test this summer with interviews and channels from last year
    * working towards: bots listening to loads of these channels, parsing them, coming up with live reports
