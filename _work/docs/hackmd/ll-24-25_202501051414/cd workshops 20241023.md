## How to Create a Story Using ArcGIS StoryMaps

ArcGIS StoryMaps allows you to combine maps with narrative text, images, and multimedia to tell a compelling story. Below are ten basic steps to guide you through creating a map story.

## 1. Create an ArcGIS StoryMaps Account
1. [Follow these Harvard instructions for making an account](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gis.harvard.edu/arcgis-online&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1729615769383296&usg=AOvVaw1tP_T_Yg-FnCtg5h_Qu5Vd)

## 2. Start a New Story
1. From the dashboard, click **Create New Story**.
3. Choose a **Sidecar** to start, which will give you a template for a scrolling narrative about a place.

## 3. Set the Title and Subtitle
1. Add a **title** that captures the theme of your story.
2. Optionally, include a **subtitle** for more detail.

## 4. Add a Map
1. Click **Add > Map** to insert an interactive map.
2. You can create a new map or choose one from **My Content** or the **ArcGIS Living Atlas**.
3. If you make an express map, you can customize the map by adding annotations, lines, tracing routes, etc. (You can't always access these additional features if you select a pre-made Living Atlas map, for example.)

## 5. Add Text Sections
1. Use the **Text Block** option to add narrative sections to your story.
2. You can choose between different text styles such as **heading**, **subheading**, and **body text** to structure your content.

## 6. Add Media (Images, Videos, and Audio)
1. Click **Add > Media** to upload images, videos, or audio files from your computer.
2. You can also link to media files from URLs, like YouTube or Flickr.

## 7. Customize Layout with Sections
1. Use **immersive sections** like the **Sidecar** or **Slideshow** to display maps, images, or videos alongside text.
2. Add multiple slides or scrolling panels to create a dynamic, layered storytelling experience.

## 8. Embed External Content
1. Use the **Embed Block** to embed content from other web sources, such as surveys, charts, or data visualizations from external platforms.

## 9. Preview and Adjust the Design
1. Click **Preview** to see how your story will appear to others.
2. Adjust your design, layout, or text to improve readability and flow.

## 10. Publish and Share
1. When you're ready, click **Publish**.
2. Choose your sharing settings: keep it private, share it with your organization, or make it public.
3. Copy the link to share your story on social media or through email.

By following these steps, you'll create an engaging, interactive StoryMap that blends geography with multimedia.

## How to Create a Map Using Felt

Felt is a user-friendly map-making tool that allows you to quickly create and share maps with text, annotations, images, and more. Below are ten basic steps to help you get started.

## 1. Create a Felt Account
1. Go to the [Felt website](https://felt.com/) and sign up for a free account.

## 2. Start a New Map
1. From the Felt dashboard, click **New Map** to start a blank map.
2. You’ll be taken to the map canvas where you can begin your design.

## 3. Search for a Location
1. Use the **Search Bar** to find a specific location or region you want to map.
2. Zoom in or out to adjust the view and frame your map.

## 4. Add Points of Interest (Markers)
1. Click the **Marker Tool** (pin icon) to add points of interest on the map.
2. Drop a marker anywhere, then add a **title** and **description** for the location.

## 5. Draw Shapes and Lines
1. Use the **Draw Tool** to add polygons, lines, or freehand shapes on your map.
2. Customize the color and size of the shapes to match your map’s style.

## 6. Add Text Annotations
1. Use the **Text Tool** to add notes, labels, or descriptions directly onto the map.
2. Place text boxes near relevant features or across map areas for context.

## 7. Import Data or Media
1. Click **Add Layer** to import data in formats such as **CSV**, **GeoJSON**, or **KML** files.
2. You can also upload images (like photos of locations) and attach them to specific map points.

## 8. Customize Layers and Styles
1. Felt allows you to layer various datasets on top of your map.
2. Use the **Layers Panel** to manage your layers and apply different styles (e.g., changing colors, opacity, and line thickness).

## 9. Collaborate in Real-Time
1. Share your map with collaborators by clicking **Share**.
2. Choose whether to give others **edit access** or **view-only access**, and work on the map in real time with others.

## 10. Save and Share
1. When you're satisfied with your map, click **Save**.
2. You can share your map by generating a shareable link or embedding it on websites.

These steps will help you create an interactive and visually compelling map using Felt's intuitive platform.
