# TS 280


In this class, students will explore various AI tools for translation and engage in meta-commentary on the quality and process of creating AI-generated outputs. To deepen their understanding, we will conduct a hands-on workshop where students can experiment with more advanced, programmatic versions of these tools. This includes activities like working with a Python notebook to iterate on a translation with a human-in-the-loop (HITL) design or using a Slack channel where multiple bots provide commentary on the same translation. Through these exercises, students will gain practical experience with AI translation processes and critically reflect on their effectiveness.
