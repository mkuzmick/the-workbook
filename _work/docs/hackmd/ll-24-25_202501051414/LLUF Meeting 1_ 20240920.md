### constellation of interests activity.
(overhead camera operation foundations.)

in pairs, find something you have in common related to tools/media/learning. (both visual learners? both excited about cameras?) then switch to another partner and do the same. then everyone together under the overhead, create a conceptual map using art supplies to show the connections between you all. learn to zoom and focus the overhead camera.

### tablescapes challenge.
