## Overview

We are defining a single as a single move that, when put together with other moves, can be the building blocks of the kinds of multimodal projects that we support.

We need examples of these things, and they should be great ways for everyone to spend time learning, with concrete deliverables that we can actually use at the end. Some basic deliverable categories: 
  * resources that use a single to teach you something (like Casey's exploding view resource that teaches you about compositing)
  * sample "moves" for visual essays that would give students a sense of how and why they might want to use the weekly single in an assignment for a course
* teach people about the Learning Lab (i.e. something that helps you understand how the ATEM system works, or how the compositing system works)

Marlon/Dani/Jordan will help you come up with specific deliverables that make sense for the singles we’re looking for using our tools of choice (things we know already or things we want to learn) - deliverables should be functional, not just fun.

Note: *this doesn't have to take up ALL of your time for the week. It's mainly meant to be a point of focus for the time you spend learning and practicing stuff (time that might otherwise be amorphous). Big project and day-to-day responsibilities obviously take priority!*


## Steps

1. Check slack or the [below list of singles](##List-of-singles) to see what the single of the week is, and brainstorm the specific one you want to work on.
2. For the single you’d like to make - in that specific slack channel (so like `#ll-project-exploded-views-and-layers`) please::
    * share a model from Pinterest that you’d like to replicate, 
    * OR send an example of a tutorial you’d like to use. 
    * That way, you can get feedback from Marlon/Dani/Jordan on whether the thing you’re thinking of is something we might use, and so they can nudge you in alignment with an upcoming project.
3. Once you get the okay, get to work!
    * Please share in incremental steps. 
    * Don’t be afraid to overshare!! 
    * The goal is that each single (and project this summer) can be segmented into tasks that you can accomplish in less than a day (ideally even less than that), so you can be sharing as you go and get a ton of feedback.
    * Marlon/Dani/Jordan can help you chunk each project so let them know if you need help.
4. Once you complete your single, please share:
    * the single you made
        * so we're looking for the **export** of the thing you made
        * and also, your **working files**! this might look like:
            * a google drive link
            * where on synology your files are saved
            * if this is code, you can add to github and send a link (and highlight in your slack message the specific lines of code)
    * share any secondary documents that you discussed with Marlon that could make it useful for LL staff, fellows, or clients. these sorts of things include
        * a resource
            * that unpacks how you made your single, or
            * full-on how-to, or
            * a how-and-why-to, or
            * a user's manual
            * unpacking why it's cool
        * a screen recording of you creating your single at high resolution
5. Be in constant dialogue with Marlon/Dani about the next thing that makes sense for you to tackle!

### Caveat
We don't only need to make new things - we also are excited to have resources that unpack student work, professional work that we've pinterested, and of course, the examples that we're building ourselves. 

## List of singles we're looking for

### 7 week of singles with the following themes
* week 1: deconstructing/unpacking/analyzing/layering/compositing (exploded views)
* week 2: sets / frames / frameworks / layouts / stages / backgrounds



### 3 weeks working on collections 
choosing your favorite(s) singles from earlier in summer, and work on sequencing them together (the story of the thing)


### weeks still TBD
#### jk ideas
* sets/frames/layouts
* patterns and repetition
* paths
* signals and signposts
* compare and contrast
* close-ups and details
* documentation, polling, and display
* cards and collections ?
* props
* literal to conceptual
#### early ideas
* single launchable animations that play a functional role in a workshop
* map-based animations
* graph-based animations
* video essay moves (working torwards a basic grammar of moves)
    * Mark up and annotations
    * Split screens
    * `Christine can help to list some more`
* AI singles in colab for every newly emergent API
* web-based syllabus
* cards
* moments and timelines / snapshots and maps
    * create an event card with the intention of making a timeline
* 1) one thing, and 2) story of that thing (by tracking it's changes over time, or showing many of that thing) turning them into more sequential stores (timelines, maps, curation/gallery tours, presentation video essay things)
    * animate it intentionally with a voice over or text to explain what's happening



## notes
the singles are largely about creating assets to be used in the following buckets/platforms:
* the LL live show (launching things with unreal and OBS)
* another is web based next sites
* another is mutlimodal essays/powerpoints/infographics/posters 


notes on week 2:
* things we do live, things that involve full stack web dev, and things that invoilve bits of content, files you create-like 
    * prototype as many of these things in the tools of your choice: the list.
    * we have these destinations for what folks are making:
    * lives on the web, launches in the studio, is the content (like the moves or parts of a visual essay)
        * 1 - the live show-launching in unreal and obs things we would use during workshops and events and things like that
        * 2 - web based materials 
            * layouts for galleries for visual essay VHBs intefaces
        * 3 - content for multimodal academic communication or essays - layouts and sets that function as visual home bases for explaining

twitch streams.  youtube live streams, every set of a sports show, the layouts of the major apple videos and things CB working in unreal so making a vietual set like you see in sports

jk in 2d ani so more like a twitch stream layout

or frames content for a website interface, etc.
 like any set, it frames the action and supports the main character and what they are doing--that character could even be ana rtifact or a person--so you could totally go with something like a player card for this-that would be a response to this week's theme.
your set or layout should be framing your characters, your character(s) being a studetn/teacher presetning in LL or on explainer video, the layout should call attention to them, leaving room for visuals they want to show,

in cb and in obs zone it's all those layouts that help you int he live production in our case for aca comm in t & l>>> what makes it a layout is anyone can go in to that thing and have their details assc with it

this is a container for eveything, but to make sure it doesn't expand into too much abstraction, can thing of some kind of main char (person obj or hero shot on webpage) thatn there are supporting--we are focused on the set and the layout rather than the character qua main character
