## space and gear prep
most of these are "nice to haves", but the one we really need is the main table classic set up.

### space and gear prep checklist
- [ ] main set up of overhead table with key and computer as source. 
    - [ ] it would be nice to have lighting and also capture people at table  (if not possible, then have small studio set up to shoe speaking to camera option)
- [ ]  2-3 podcast stations with rainbow macs on garageband. we could use our phones to do the activity but it could be cool to have at least one with an audio interface and pod mics set up. 
- [ ] main studio (or classroom) set up with overhead and art materials (so this could really just be a table with awesome art materials)
- [ ] some art books and art materials, blockprinting, clay, etc. (see above)
- [ ] green screen set up for keying too? and get talulah to do live event edits?!
