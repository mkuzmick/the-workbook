# heb-140-planning

deadline: in person consultation/show and tell with JD on Tuesday, June 18 @ 11am

we'll use prepping for HEB140 as:
1.  our first test of the big-AI project workflow
2.  test of project workflow for 24-25 in general
3.  the initial delivery of the AI-move-cards or whatever we describe them as


## two lists for MW and MK to populate

### "moves" or elements

- build a custom GPT using the dialogue interface
- build a custom Assistant using the playground
- build a custom Assistant using Colab
- building a Slackbot
- 

### just cool projects we don't want to leave out

- that TDM98 course where we had multiple characters talking to each other
- complit200
- slavic191
- slavic 121/tdm121k
- emr162
- english189vg



### from email

> * Working in pre-made Python notebooks with the major APIs: This will allow students to see under the hood when creating a bot and querying the APIs. They can also drag and drop code blocks and experiment with recursive functions.
> * Custom GPTs and Assistants: In OpenAI, there is the possibility to develop custom GPTs using a very simple, no-code interface. Alternatively, they can create assistants using a low-code playground interface. This would enable students to create an assistant or agent to help write their papers, which would be easily gradable since you can inspect the code and prompt.
> * Optional session for creating Slackbots: We discussed the possibility of having interested students attend an optional session where they would learn to turn these assistants or agents into Slackbots they can interact with.
> * Coding groups of Slackbots: Another idea was to have students code groups of Slackbots that could act as circles of friends, demonstrating some of the principles they are learning about.
