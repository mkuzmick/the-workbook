## Description
Marlon tested the HackMD API to see if it could be used as a destination for text generated by a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The HackMD API allows users to programmatically create and manage markdown documents. A custom GPT is a version of an AI language model designed to assist with specific tasks. By integrating these two technologies, it becomes possible to automatically generate and store well-formatted reports, notes, and other documentation. This can save time, ensure consistency, and enhance collaboration, especially in settings where detailed records are necessary.
