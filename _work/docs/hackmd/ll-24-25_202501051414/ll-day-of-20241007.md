    - *conversations with past presentation transcripts interpreted by custom GPTs*
    - *printed essays generated on past presentations*
    - printed essays in realtime (ideally with media of students)
    - MW's "how to create a custom GPT" doc open
    - test speed at which GPT is updated for other users (good LLUF task)
