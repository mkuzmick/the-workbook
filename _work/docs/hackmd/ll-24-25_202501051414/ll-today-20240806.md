# ll-today-20240806

dani show madeleine how to set up project channels for the AI projects (i.e. for the GPT building and testing channel we'll pin the Airtable Madeleine made, project doc if exists, any GPTs we might want people to return to, etc.)


for tomorrow's meeting:
* very basic bots using LS1a or Ec10 materials and sample text from Chris or Logan or Greg (as closely in alignment with their text as possible for base case---this is a sample of "Case 1" of Chris Stubbs's cases)
    * then MVP of a very simple test (such as adding xml to constrain output or comparing and contrasting including text in instructions/system prompt vs as pdf for retrieval)
* interview-to-text-or-structured-output
    * sample 1 => JK Artist Statement GPT--send to HackMD in multiple ways to test a variety of things:
        * how well does it synthesize long conversations at the end of the thread?
        * how easy is it to keep on task, with questions following criteria and output fitting criteria (again A/B tests are great if there's a testing MVP)
    * sample 2 => Airtable Form (maybe do one we could offer PFs or MDFs?)
* quick versions of Chris's samples (if not above and especially if we are getting at a technical question we'd want to ask HUIT)
    1. see above
    2. skill-building tutor-bot
    3. generation of quiz/exam questions (deposit somewhere)
    4. collection and synthesis of classroom input in realtime (this is a good one to think about)
    5. course review (hold off for now)
    6. grade sheet analysis (no)
    7. data exploration in Python Notebook (could be useful to think of something like this in our context)
