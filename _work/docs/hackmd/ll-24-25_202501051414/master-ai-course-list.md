## course list

* MOD HEB 241R, Israeli Cinema and Culture, Nader Uthman
    * This course, one of the most advanced Hebrew courses taught within the FAS, is using a GPT that assists students with primary-source translation and comprehension. Learning Lab staff also augmented a workshop with an AI tool stack that automates video editing and other elements of media production. 
* COMPLIT 207, Theorizing Digital Capitalism, Moira Weigel
    * Students will be evaluating the output of GPTs designed to sound like famous cultural theorists, and will iteratively improve the prompts themselves as a way of exploring the powers and limitations of AI while simultaneously becoming more precise in their understanding of the course’s reading list 
* GENED 1089, The Border: Race, Politics and Health in Modern Mexico, Gabriela Soto Laveaga
    * This course is a GENED, but faced a significant language barrier for non-Spanish speakers in past years. Learning Lad staff demonstrated the ways in which ChatGPT and GPTs can be utilized to assist students with accurate translation and comprehension of primary sources. 
* COMPLIT 111X, Breaking Points: Art, Scholarship, and Social Movements, Matylda Figlerowicz
    * GPTs will be utilized in this course, made by students, as well as recursive AI code contained with python notebooks. This will allow students to take part in “exquisite-corpse” analysis of various readings and materials. 
* ECON 10A, Microeconomics, David Laibson and Jason Furman 
    * After guidance on textbook use shifted early in the term, Learning Lab staff pivoted with EC 10 teaching support to create two GPTs that handle staff-facing course management: a Section Leader Guide and a Weekly Office Hours Scheduler. 
* CHINESE, Jennifer Liu and Fangzheng Zhang
    * The teaching staff for Chinese has been relatively independent after some initial assistance getting started. They were excited about the possibility of creating a multitude of GPTs to model different conversation partners and units of vocabulary.
* ANE 170, Food, Identity, and the Biblical World, Julia Rhyder
    * This class will encourage students to create custom GPTs to explore various elements of course content, including ancient recipes and translation of primary sources. 
* HISTSCI 1490, The History and Culture of Stigma, Allan Brandt and Sara Press
    * Students will be designing their own custom GPTs intended to reduce stigma associated with a particular condition
* AFVS 153BR, Intermediate Animation, Ruth Lingford
    * Animation students will be allowed to use AI tools for this term, including Stable Diffusion. Bok Center staff met with the AFVS tech team about an array of AI-animation options.
* MUSIC 280X, Intermedia Composition and Performance, Yvette Jackson
    * AI tools in this course will be beyond the ChatGPT suite, and will focus on visual generation (video and static images), as well as some experimentation with AI that creates music. 
* MUSIC 223R, Neo-Riemannian Analysis,  Michèle Duguay
    * Students will use ChatGPT Edu to create images to assist with experimental musical score forms and media associated with musical production.
* ENGLISH 98R 005,  Science Fictional and Magical Realities, Karina Matthews
    * This course has AI natively attached to the content and will be exploring the student use of AI across a range of tools in various media forms (text, image, audio, etc.) to explore simulations. 
* EXPOS 20, Tongue-Tied, Taleen Mardirossian
    * This course will make use of our AI-augmented studio production tools. This will allow a small number of staff to automate the creation of course content and trailers. 
* GENED 1145, Global Japanese Cinema, Alexander Zahlten
    * Students in this course will use diffusion models to produce storyboards, translate films, and create new media. 
* SLAVIC118, Reading Tolstoy’s War and Peace, Julie Buckler
    * GPTs will be used in this course to assist students with the translation and interpretation of Russian and French material within War and Peace. Students can also use AI to produce and analyze fanfiction produced around this text. 
* SLAVIC 132, Russia’s Golden Age: Literature, Arts, and Culture, Julie Buckler
    * This course will utilize GPTs to assist students with translation and interpretation of texts from Russia’s Golden Age with more accuracy, flexibility, and personalization than possible in the past.
* FYSEMR 65P, Anton Chekhov: Stories, Plays, Productions, Films, Julie Buckler
    * GPTs will be utilized by students to explore the different media forms extant within the work of Chekhov, allowing for multi-modal and multi-lingual engagement. 
* FYSEMR 65Q, This Is Epic! The World’s Oldest Literature, Then and Now,  Celine Debourse
    * AI tools will be applied broadly across this course for student use. Bok staff demonstrated a template for an “Artist’s Statement Assistant” GPT that interviews the students about their final projects for the course. The course will also be coming into the Learning Lab and use AI to generate storyboards related to the Epic of Gilgamesh. 
* HEB 140, The Evolution of Friendship, Jennifer Devereaux
    * In this course, students will be producing GPTs to assist them in the creation of Research Proposals. The finished proposals, the GPTs, and “artist statement”-like metacommentary will form a major assignment. 
* TS 280
    * In this class, students will explore various AI tools for translation and engage in meta-commentary on the quality and process of creating AI-generated outputs. To deepen their understanding, we will conduct a hands-on workshop where students can experiment with more advanced, programmatic versions of these tools. This includes activities like working with a Python notebook to iterate on a translation with a human-in-the-loop (HITL) design or using a Slack channel where multiple bots provide commentary on the same translation. Through these exercises, students will gain practical experience with AI translation processes and critically reflect on their effectiveness.
