Anna brought SLAVIC 121/TDM 121K: Ballet, Past and Present students in for a workshop where they engaged in a number of different multimodal activities to reflect on ballet, the way knowledge about ballet is transmitted through time, and on media reproductions of ballet.
- At one station, students worked with printed frame-by-frame stills from the ballets they were analyzing, annotating them as they would in a visual essay
- At another, they learned the basic video editing skills required to isolate specific ballet movements, juxtaposing them in a single frame or assembling a series as a montage, or exporting a series of looping gifs
- Finally, students posed on our green screen stage, then used computer vision tools to analyze and isolate the positions of their bodies in order to feed these in to Stable Diffusion, which is the main open-source AI image generation tool. They learned to use the images of their own poses as controllers that could strictly determine key features of the exported image. In a sense, their bodies became the "input devices" that controlled the AI generation in thought provoking ways.

## Slavic 191: Silent Film

To explore the medium of film through the practice of making *and* analyzing it, students in Slavic 191: Silent Film came to the Learning Lab for an interactive workshop that deployed different elements of silent film. Students examined stills from different silent films they had watched in the course, creating their own intertitles on large black pieces of paper to describe and analyze the shot composition, framing, camera angles, and lighting of different scenes. At the same time, the speech to text Open AI API Whisper was used to take what students were saying outloud and generate digital intertitles on the spot that had the students' insights on them. At another station, students explored camera work, blocking, and acting, thinking about the capabilities of cameras and how camera positioning and framing shape the film's narrative or convey an actor's subjectivity. A third station used a green screen and cameras to project ink-drawn film sets made by students in the style of German expressionist films like Dr. Caligari. Students then devised scenes to enact in front of their film set. Through this workshop, students gained significant fist-hand experience working with the form, learning about the relationship between form and content through the act of making a silent film.

## FYSEMR 36G: The Creative Work of Translating

Students in The Creative Work of Translating look at different types of translation, as well as the different ways that translation happens. During the week when students were examining translation across media, they came to the Learning Lab for a workshop about using different media to translate--from text to the voice, from the voice to the body, from text and voice to image, from moving to still image. Students rotated through stations that allowed them to practice these types of translations. By the end of the sesion, students had made their own translations of the same texts, culminating in  a collaborative, layered translation, with students' voices, musical compositions, gestures, and images integrating into a group translation of the text. Students also had the opporunity to try out some ideas for their final projects and to get feedback on those ideas.

## COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy

In Jeffrey Schnapp’s COMPLIT200: Computing Fantasy, students explored theories of folktales and modernist authors who used various algorithmic and computational methods for generating literary content. As an example of this, GAICAs developed fairytale generators that students could use to generate their own illustrated tales. Finally, the Learning Lab hosted a series of workshops and work sessions where students could use our tools and art supplies as they completed their collaborative final group projects: three books of illustrated AI folktales.

## EMR 162: Race and AI

In Leslie Fernandez’s EMR 162: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Race and AI, students examined biases in AI image generation using models like GPT-4/DALL-E, Gemini Advanced, and Midjourney. The Learning Lab wrote code that could reveal for students the revised prompts that models use to generate images. By interacting with this code, which returned this revised prompt as its output, students were able to see how major AI corporations–including OpenAI and Google–manipulate users’ prompts to generate images that are ostensibly more diverse. These prompts highlighted the corporations’ cultural biases and their inadequate responses to critiques of their content generation. Students analyzed these images and texts in conversation with each other, forming critical insights about what these new tools will mean for our society.

## GENED 1145: East Asian Cinema

In this workshop for *GENED 1145: Global Japanese Cinema*, students had the opportunity to engage with film analysis reflecting on various filmic elements such as mise-en-scene, cinematography, composition, and framing. The workshop was structured around the central theme of layering, revealing the various layers of a film, and animation. The goal was two-fold: first, to familiarize students with the elements that comprise a film's style and visual storytelling; second, to inspire deeper reflection on how these elements can be incorporated into students’ video essays. In discussing these filmic and conceptual techniques, students explored how filmic elements combined elicit coherent and affective viewing experiences. Additionally, the workshop highlighted the relationship between narrative structure and formal qualities of the cinematic medium.

## ENGLISH 184CF: City Fictions Mapping Workshop

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F060QTPJQ9Z/eng184-group1-intro.jpg?pub_secret=302d7dbdd2)

Students in ENGLISH 184CF: City Fictions create two maps of either London or Mumbai that, when viewed together, reveal something profound about the ways in which life is lived and experienced in that city. To help students learn about the conceptual work that maps can do--as well as to introduce them to the formal components of maps--Lara designed and facilitated a workshop at the Learning Lab that allowed students to quickly prototype maps and receive feedback on them. Lara had students choose from a series of themes (gender, age, religion, desire, species, mode of transport, time of day) and then create maps of Cambridge that reveal how that theme is articulated in space. Students used projections of maps, paper maps, and digital mapping tools to create quick prototypes of these maps, reflecting in the process on the viability of their project (e.g., the challenge of collecting data, how significant the insight is, how to visualize this insight).

## GENED 1001: Stories from the End of the World

This course explores how stories from "the end of the world" are portrayed in various world religions and how those concepts travel to contemporary art and pop cultural forms, including film and anime and literature. To help students prepare for their final creative projects Lara helped design a workshop about world building in different media forms. For the final project, students need to create their own creative version of an apocalypse. This could take the form of writing or multi-modal forms like podcasts or video, painting, song composition, whatever they think will express best their idea. It was important to the course team for students to learn about the affordances of each medium, as well as their limitations. Lara helped develop prompts related to the course material, and then had students work with this prompt through three different types of mediums: creative writing, sound, and video. Students needed to create a particular type of apocalypse in each of these three forms, reflecting along the way about what each medium enabled them to do and what constraints the medium posed.
