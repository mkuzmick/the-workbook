# Sharing Your Custom GPT

This document is a more thorough description of how to share your GPT, as described in this [GPT creation guide](https://hackmd.io/@ll-24-25/rywdQJV50/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F9Zz4h1UCRsmwGnqvJwq6Fw).

**NOTE**: The Harvard University workspace for ChatGPT Edu has stringent privacy and data protections. As a result, GPTs made by these accounts can *only* be shared with others *within* the Harvard workspace. Conversely, GPTs made *outside* of the Harvard workspace are not available to those with regular ChatGPT accounts. 

If you are sharing a GPT made within the Harvard workspace for members who have accounts (FAS staff, faculty, and students), you can find sharing options and instructions below:

First, naviagte to the "Edit" page for your GPT, then click "Share" in the upper right-hand corner:

Then, click on the dropdown menu, which should automatically be set to "Invite-only:"

Think of these GPTs as individual google docs: 

* Invite-only: 
    * You can keep your GPT on "Invite-only" and add individual email addresses/accounts within the Harvard workspace. 
        * This is useful for individual-use GPTs or GPTs used by a small group of people 

* Anyone-at-harvard-univerity-chatgpt
    * This is equivalent to creating a shareable link. Only those within the Harvard workspace with the link will be able to access this GPT 
        * This is useful for GPTs made for specific groups (departments, courses, etc.)

* harvard-univerity-chatgpt
    * This posts the GPT within the "leaderboard" seen when you hit "Explore GPTs" from your main ChatGPT window. This makes the GPT viewable to anyone within the Harvard workspace. 
        * This is useful for general-use tools or template GPTs. 


You will also see two options beside your sharing choice: 

* Can chat
    * This shares your GPT and only allows for "chatting" with the GPT 
        * This is most often the correct selection 

* Can view configuration 
    * This makes your elements of your GPT visible, and allows users to duplicate your GPT (including files). 
        * This may be used in the case of template GPTs or wide-sharing of a tool.

Once you have changed your sharing setting, make sure to hit "Update" in the right-hand corner before navigating away from your GPT editing page.
