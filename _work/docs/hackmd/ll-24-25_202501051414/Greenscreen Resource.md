# Greenscreen Resource

You are probably familiar with the term "greenscreen" or possibly "bluescreen," referring to how filmmakers can photograph a subject in front of a green or blue background and then composite in a separate clip into that background.

The technical term for this operation is "Chroma Key". "Chroma" refers to the colored background. The editing operation makes this part transparent, allowing the new background to be seen.

## Chroma Key in Adobe Premiere Pro


### Tools and Setup
Computers IN LAMONT - CHECK LATER have the Premiere software. You can also use your Harvard Key to download the software onto your own device. [HUIT tutorial here](https://huit.harvard.edu/adobe-creative-cloud)!

You will also need 2 video clips: 1 of the subject in front of a greenscreen, and 1 of the desired background.

### Applying Greenscreen Effect in Premiere

1. Import your video clips.
* Create a new Project (You may need to start from File - New)
* Select media from your computer, OR alternatively drag and drop your clips into the "Import" box on bottom left
3. Create a sequence.
* Drag and drop your imported videos into the timeline area. Make sure your subject video is ON TOP of the background video
* You can quickly and easily trim your clips by hovering your cursor over the front or back ends, then clicking and dragging until you reach your desired start or end point.
* To remove audio from any of your clips, right click on it and choose "Unlink". This will then allow you to select the audio by clicking on it and then delete it.
5. Drop in Chrome effect.
* In the Effects tab (you may need to find it at Window - Effects OR Shift+F7), search for the "ultra key" effect. Drag and drop this effect over the green screen footage.
6. Select the greenscreen and make it disappear!
* Click on the greenscreen video
* Go to "Effect Controls" tab
* Next to "Key Color", click on the eyedropper tool.
* Click on the green area with the eyedropper tool.

### Refining your Chroma Key-ed Clip
Some ideas for refining your clip(s):
Click on either of the clips and look at the tools on the upper left. Here, you can play with
* Position: drag the clip around the screen to reposition it
* Scale: make your subject or background bigger or smaller by changing the percent.
    * You can also easily scale a clip to exactly fit your frame size by right-clicking the clip in the timeline and selecting "Scale to frame size"
* The greenscreen effect can be refined by using the tools under Ultra Key. Experiment by dragging the various sliders around. "Pedestal" and "Contrast" are definitely worth trying.

### Saving your work
* Go to "File - Export - Media".
* Make sure you are saving to your desired "Location."
* Click the big blue "Export" button on the bottom right to Save.
