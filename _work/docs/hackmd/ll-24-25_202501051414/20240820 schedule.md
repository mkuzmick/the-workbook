## arc
* help MDFs understand what teaching and learning centers do
* backward design/defining learning goals foregrounds skills/knowledge we want our students to have 
    * rather than building toward an assessment or around content to be delivered
* importance of maintaining alignment between what students are learning and how you're getting them to demonstrate what they're learning to you as the instructor
    * summative vs formative assessment
* "forward design" the LL approach
    * looking to media
    * thinking about the key "moves" and affordances of that media
    * and from there - thinking about what it can enable in the academic space
    * how can these media forms usher in the future of academic communication, sharing knowledge, reaching a public - and the many many other goals we have for ourselves as scholars and teachers and that we have for our students


## cd activity notes
* make a new hackmd doc
    * h1, h2
    * bullet points
    * embed media
* list of things this media form enables
    * think about what the form (rather than the content does)
    * how the pieces of the machine work
* list of how those moves align with things you'd want students to be able to do in your discipline
