# music-250hfa-planning

tour of the tools

exploring shorter video essays (can be the center, and just allude to other things)


## tasks
* rip podcast clip
* rip video essay
* matrix
* rip the songs
    * the ones that the podcast is talking about
    * also rage against the machine
    * matrix music too
* gallery of cool stuff music people have done (start a working doc with media to show)
    * david in an airtable
    * chris and siriana reports etc

## plan

### mk timeline based on Leo's notes?

3:00-3:15: welcome and introductions (involve a studio element to make it go longer? also to prep them for the final steps in the session?) -- yes some kind of introduction under overhead
3:15-3:30: very quick tour of some of the tools we've seen music grads use in the past for their teaching and for communicating their research
3:30-4:00: Podcast clip, recording and reflection (MK Q: can we ai-transcribe and do something the the summary?)
*   Maybe we can make this section a little longer? We play the clip, assign different people to focus on different aspects -- 1) narration, 2) music, 3) argument and overall structure and take down notes
*   We then share out observations for our area. 
*   Discussion questions (to set the table for activity -- acknowledge that each of these considerations will be different depending on the course -- use the example as a sample assignment):
    *   Models: What did you like and not like about this podcast? What would and would not be appropriate for a course? How would you select a model for students?
    *   Evaluation: What are some of the criteria you would establish for evaluating a podcast, either analogous to elements of a traditional essay or different?
    *   Workload: How would you account for the added labor of recording a podcast, if this was an added option?
    *   Scaffolding: How would you scaffold assignments building to the podcast over the course of the semester?

* Students get into pairs and have a discussion about what makes a good podcast, recorded with podcast mics into GarageBand. They may even demonstrate best practices of editing using music files. Some or each share out a snippet if time.

4:00-4:05: break
4:05-4:25: watch video essay and discuss evaluation

* We play the clip, assign different people to focus on different aspects -- 1) narration, 2) music, 3) visuals, 4) argument and overall structure and take down notes
*   We then share out observations for our area. 
*   Discussion questions (to set the table for activity -- acknowledge that each of these considerations will be different depending on the course -- use the example as a sample assignment):
    *   Models: What did you like and not like about this video essay? What would and would not be appropriate for a course? How would you select a model for students?
    *   Evaluation: What are some of the criteria you would establish for evaluating a video essay, either analogous to elements of a traditional essay or different?
    *   Workload: How would you account for the added labor of recording a video essay, if this was an added option?
    *    Scaffolding: How would you scaffold assignments building to the video essay over the course of the semester?


4:25-4:40: in pairs brainstorm a way of diagramming the elements of a good video essay
4:40-on: present and reflect and goodbye


### Leo's notes

I’ll make sure to update the HackMD in the early afternoon in preparation, but just wanted to mention that I worked a lot yesterday on firming up the plan for this workshop, as long as it sounds good to you Marlon. The gist is this: First the survey of the various digital resources (hoping Marlon you can take the lead on that). The first half of the remaining time would be spent listening to, taking notes, and reflecting on a short podcast clip I selected and matters of evaluation, then the students go over in pairs to GarageBand and record themselves in a conversational-style podcast talking about what makes a good podcast/important technical considerations/etc, then share. The second half would be spent watching, taking notes, and reflecting on a short video essay clip I selected and matters of evaluation, then the students in pairs brainstorm a way of diagramming (drawing) what makes a good video essay/important technical considerations using markers/colored paper,  then present (or even re-draw while explaining in real time) under the overhead cam.

I think this kind of “meta” activity would fit well with the pedagogical focus on the class, and is a technique they could even end up using when they teach.

Here’s the podcast clip I liked (Episode 8 on this page): https://www.theworldaccordingtosound.org/ways-of-knowing

And here’s the video essay I liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXGyCp6aQPo

### mk walking through the plan during meeting

* relatively quick **overview**/survey (can have up on computers if interactive, and walk people through it)
* **unpack** 1-2 examples of a video essay (as large chunk of session)
    * Annotating/drawing structure on paper
    * How to find good models
    * What is the role of the video essay? Questions around music appreciation
    * Discussion of workload, evaluation, and scaffolding
* **activity** portion: then divide people up to think about scaffolding and have them make something in their scaffolding medium. examples:
    * live annotating a score
    * playing something and talking about it as you're playing it
    * overhead camera and etc.
    * analysis of spectrogram

*if we can find like, one song that everyone likes, everyone take a different part and then find a different way to annotate it, etc. and then we bring it all back together in the end.*

LIVE ANALYSIS
speaking over, or drawing over, but a performance element.

basic building blocks/ elements of a music video essay:
* some music that we hear
* words that we are saying
* visual-grid of a socre, gird of a guitar or bass, piano, soemthing wirtten on paper that you lead us through to help us grasp the strucutre of the music

and then we see a bunch of different varieties of that.
