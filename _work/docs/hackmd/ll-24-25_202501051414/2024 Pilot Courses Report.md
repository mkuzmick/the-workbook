Pilot courses implementing chatGPT EDU: 

## LS1A

This course had an approach to AI-application that was heavily influenced by the premise of the pilot. Initially, they wanted a tutorbot that could cover  entirety of the course material. They were also interested in integrating this tool directly into Canvas. Following two major pivots made during the summer (namely, shifting to chatGPT EDU and the conflicting guidance on textbook use), they became more interested in assignment-specific GPTs and teaching-staff-facing tools. 

Over the course of two meeting with the Bok Center, LS1a teaching staff were given tours of the [chatGPT EDU interface](https://hackmd.io/V_7Pu4XfQUmQmpTP1r8duA) and demoed various GPTs. The first was an assignment-specifc GPT (Stubbs Case 1) with a Kestin/Stubbs template prompt. The other was [a modified version](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-RPAzVvJ0C-economic-assignment-helper-prototype), with simulated multi-shot prompting in the "Instructions" field, stricter guidelines around response length, and more emphasis on questioning the students. 

LS1a staff also asked to brainstorm GPT applications that could be directed at teaching staff, as posited by Marlon in an earlier zoom call. They were interested in GPTs that could be fed CSV data of TFs grades (exported from Gradescope) to identify statistical outliers, as well as a more advanced version: a GPT that could produce its own grades of student work and find TF grading discrepancies by comparing those two data sets. Lastly, they were interested in a TF-training GPT (with case studies, example student questions, and a knowledge base of their teaching manual and syllabus). While it was too late to produce these GPTs in time for their TF training, they plan to reconnect before the Spring term.

Our meetings ended with discussing the creation of student-facing tutors for their five units, and they said they would reach out again if they required assistance with testing and/or prompt engineering for use this fall.

## EC10

EC10 had a very clear goal from the outset: a single tutorbot to cover the breadth of their course material (textbook, lecture transcripts, practice problem sets, practice exams, and readings). While Bok Center staff collected [this data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bg9WMJnPJ2tM9iw4NKjw9du3FbiG4eHy), the end recommendation in meeting with EC10 staff was to create more granular GPTs, due to new textbook guidance and GPT efficacy. [An assignment-specifc GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-RPAzVvJ0C-economic-assignment-helper-prototype) was created to demonstrate this. Despite positive feedback on the prototype, in response to the perceived risk around course material upload and the short timeline for testing, they defaulted to creating GPTs for teaching staff this fall. 

*This pivot is a very common pattern when consulting with faculty, insofar as a pattern can be claimed. Across these limited cases, faculty tended to be more comfortable creating administrative tools for themselves or for their TFs, as opposed to GPTs that require course materials and/or are meant for student-use.* 

While Bok Staff encourage faculty to duplicate prototype GPTs demoed in consultations, before editing and testing the final GPTs with their course staff, EC10 requested GPTs to be made to their specifications before duplication. In sum, two GPTs were created for EC10 that assisted with course management for TFs: 

* [Section Leader Guide](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-WoudVmn7q-ec10-section-leader-guide)
    * This GPT contains two documents: the "Section Leader Manual" and the course syllabus. This makes it easier for TFs to query these resources with natural language, allowing them to easily ask questions like: 
        * How are student absences handled for section?
        * What is the default policy for handling late work?
        * Which page of which document has information on student absences? 
* [Weekly Office Hours Scheduler](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QDlHpWqSk-weekly-office-hours-scheduler)
    * This GPT is student-facing, but it performs an administrative role. Every week on Sunday evening, TFs update a shared Google Sheet with their office hours-- which times are cancelled, which are moved, and which links students can use to sign up. TFs have used this document in the past to advise students who miss their section times or to find other section times to direct their students to. However, as long as a member of the teaching staff uploads a new csv file of this google sheet every week, TFs will no longer need to respond to these emails weekly. Instead, student can instead query this GPT with questions like: 
        * Can you help me find an Office Hours time this evening?
        * Where is my TF holding Office Hours?
        * What Office Hours are available for Friday?

## CHINESE 

The Introductory Chinese courses have modeled the Bok Staff's approach to all other faculty interested in AI this year. While we have given special attention to courses like LS1a and EC10 where needed, the teaching staff for Chinese has been more independent. They were excited about the possibility of creating a multitude of GPTs to model different conversation partners and units of vocabulary. We had one consultation where they were given a tour of the chatGPT EDU interface and some demo GPTs. Afterwards, Bok staff communicated with the Head TF over email, providing template prompts and the link to a [Prompting Pal](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-lVLgGnrtB-pedagogical-prompt-pal), which can help teaching staff brainstorm GPTs use-cases and draft prompts. At the last update, teaching staff had made several GPTs and were testing the result with TFs. -->
