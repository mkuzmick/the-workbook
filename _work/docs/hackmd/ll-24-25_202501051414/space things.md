# space things
glass studio, storage 2, and front desk are the priorities.

label bins (blue and dan monday and tuesday)

generating content for boards (mainly the studio) related to heb140 - buttons


## front desk
* tulle
* decide about pipe set up/config
* maybe draw a few more temporary things in chalk
* one red chair can go here
## classroom
* tables
* potentially store things under the tables
* move out computer from shelf
* fix rainbow lights
* instructions on turning the rainbow lights on
* probably move new boxed TV to music room or mk office
* push rainbow lights on the back wall so they're slightly less visible and match the ones on the wall closer to the front desk
* print up what was on ipads so shelves missing ipads read clearly what they were
* fill the empty shelf with things that look cool and intentional
* TBD on red chairs if they fit
## glass studio

## hallway
* edit photos on display on wall
    * get more faculty shots
    * more students doing things
    * more academic content (some better sci comm things, etc.)
* potentially another cloud of photos by caterpillar seats next to front desk
* hallway counter should be TOTALLY clean

## storage room 1
* sort storage room containers
* make magnet filled out labels for all compartments, and every compartment has matching items on it

## studio system etc.
* racks on left
* everything stored there, even it's not cabled yet

## main studio
* green screen up in the studio
* just clean
* studio/control room windows: get rid of gold curtains (we want full length blue curtains that match each other on both windows, and if that odesn't exist, one blue one red on each window)
* photos + magnet buttons can be added to the cabinet that hasn't been painted yet

## small studio
* green scren or black canvas 

## fireplace room
* clean
