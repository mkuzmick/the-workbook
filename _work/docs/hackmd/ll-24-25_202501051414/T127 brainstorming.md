# T127 brainstorming

--- 
## project draft 


LL description: 

The Bok Center's Learning Lab (LL) partners with faculty from the FAS to incorporate innovative and multimodal assignments into their courses. These assignments engage students through diverse communication and creation methods, including data visualization, filmmaking, podcasting, AI, and virtual reality. Working closely with the LL staff to support these assignments are the Learning Lab's fellows, which includes both the undergraduate Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (LLUFs) and graduate Media & Design Fellows (MDFs). Fellows play pivotal roles in fostering instructional innovation across disciplines. The LL's studio is a cornerstone of this ecosystem, functioning not just as a space with technological tools and art supplies, but as an instrument itself-- an adaptable maker-space where faculty can experiment with new pedagogical techniques. This setup harnesses the expertise of the LL's diverse staff and fellows, making it an ideal environment for educational exploration and innovation.

### AI Projects

1. **Generative AI for Educators Demo**
   - **Project Description**: This project involves creating a hands-on demonstration of generative AI tools aimed at faculty clients, introducing them to the functionalities and potential uses of generative AI in their curriculum. 
   - **Project Scope**: Build and teach interactive demonstrations, based off of ongoing LL AI offerings and our color-based schema. The final capstone may take the form of a studio installation, online gallery, or workshop.
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Madeleine]

2. **AI-Assisted Chatbots**
   - **Project Description**: Participants will develop and refine AI-driven chatbots designed to support FAS courses. Forms range from custom OpenAI GPTs to assistants deployed across Jupyter Notebooks and Slack Channels. Given the dynamic landscape of emerging AI tools, this project will be geared toward exploring and experimenting with a range of AI tools and developing documentation that can guide others through a similar exploration.
   - **Project Scope**: Concept brainstorming, prompt engineering, and initial user testing.
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Madeleine/Marlon]

3. **AI Resource Pack for Humanists and Artists**
   - **Project Description**: Creation of a suite of tools and asynchronous resources related to AI, specifically with humanists and artists in mind (i.e., folks who do not necessarily have a background in coding). These resources may take the form of spreadsheets (Airtable, Sheets, etc.), markdown documents, or lookbooks. 
   - **Project Scope**: Discovery and exploration of tools, thorough documentation (faculty-facing), and user guides (student-facing).
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Madeleine/Christine]

4. **Group Project AI Assistant**
   - **Project Description**: Development of an AI bot that can facilitate managing student-led group projects in courses. For example, this bot could feature auto-reminders, task tracking, project storytelling support, voice to text generation, etc.
   - **Project Scope**: Development of natural language processing tasks, integration into project management tools.
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Christine/Dani]

### Media and Communication Projects

5. **AI-Assisted Video Editing**
   - **Project Description**: Explore the integration of AI into the Learning Lab video editing workflow, potentially using transcript-based editing tools to enhance the post-production process.
   - **Project Scope**: Development of AI-integrated workflows, testing and refining of these workflows, partnership with studio staff.
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Sophie?]

6. **Live Event Media Processing**
   - **Project Description**: Implementation of AI tools to process and generate media during live workshops in the Learning Lab, including transcription and structured text generation from various audio feeds.
   - **Project Scope**: Learning the Learning Lab event processing system, live testing and refinement of media generation tools, application of processing in selected workshops. 
   - **Main Contact/Staff Member**: [Marlon]

## past T127 project ideas (from spring 2024 course)
* GAI in the classroom
* course chatbot
* learner experience platform (LXP)
* equity review of online content for TLL
* media workshop development
* media lookbook 
    * help faculty know how media can enhance their courses
* design a field study
* development professional training materials for TLL
* anti-racist teaching and advising resource database
* project management communication
* design an alternative capstone assignment

## LL capstone project ideas

### Course-specific/holistic projects: 

These projects align more closely with our MDF/Course-specific models

* AI-augmented media "live show"/workshop
    * design workshop that thoughtfully integrates AI to enhance the learning experience
    * use media/tools of LL studio to facilitate student interactions with AI
    * would involve making forms that come up in other T127 projects (e.g., lookbooks, prototypes, visualizations)
    * would involve learning project management strategies that are important in the course (doing project management is another project option T127 outlines)
    * would involve learning about alternative assignment design (if workshop supports a capstone project)

### Task-specific projects: 

These projects are more discrete in focus, and tend to revolve around a project with a single output/function. These are more similar to the types of projects currently found in the T127 list:

* "Project Management Communication" for LL 
    * task tracking, assisting with the airtable, shadowing Dani 
    * Project management, a good fit for students who aren't seeking instructional design, but prefer to build skills in management and operations
        * similar to the current project desccription from the materials: 
            * "Large, complex projects such as the *How People Learn* course require careful attention to team communication. In a team-based work environment it is crucial that **tasks, deadlines, and roadblocks are tracked**, and that everyone on the project has the information they need to complete their work.However, maintaining clear lines of communication can be challenging, and the work of project management can sometimes get in the way of the work of the project. This semester the Teaching and Learning Lab will **explore different methods of communication and project tracking to ensure that our process is as efficient as possible.**"
* AI "Assignment" Design 
    * similar to [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@ll-23-24/r1lSNsxCa), which directed [J≈çsh's project](https://hackmd.io/@ll-23-24/rkb6gwJkC/%2FDA1U2pI6S4-mpFL8fDQdwQ), as well as a project described in the current list: 
        * "Recognizing the diverse needs and interests of HPL students, a faculty member proposed an alternative assignment. **The alternative assignment can be a creative yet manageable project, such asmodifying an existing curriculum or building on a 'Problem of Practice' assignment for  summative assessment.** The assignment should align with students' career interests or offer practical ways to implement innovations from a 'How People Learn' field study, while still achieving the learning outcomes. Through this project, students will learn to implement a subject matter expert's vision and promote learner agency in the design of summative assessment. **You will understand the potential challenges and opportunities of an alternative assessment approach, identify a learner group for analysis, and craft a relevant prototype for a new assignment**."

## connecting to LL things
* connect capstone project to one of Big 5?
* connect HGSE students to MDFs, LLUFs, GAICAs for prototyping and user-testing (and with MDFs - thinking about assessment)

## ideas with mk
* ai 
    * intro demo
        * interactive intro to suite of generative AI tools for educators
    * helping to build chatbots
    * resource development 
        * like afvs - artists and educators of artists
        * vanilla thing with six machines - geared around a suite of tools
        * involving them in singles and documentation of singles
    * group project management bot 
        * AI bot that helps with assisting student-led group projects 
            * auto-reminders, ensuring everyone is submitting work, allowing students to reach out to the bot to nudge others
        * Natural Language task processing 
* media 
    * editing (sc + cc)
        * ai-assisted video editing
            * perhaps editing based off of the transcript
    * event processing
        * live generation of content fed back into the system
            * transcription, structured text, etc.
