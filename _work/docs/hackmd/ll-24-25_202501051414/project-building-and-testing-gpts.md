# project-building-and-testing-gpts

## initial workflow

after finalizing Airtable structure

- create GPT record
- aggregate files for retrieval in Google Drive Folder and add this path to the record
- add files to Airtable and link to GPT record (could be done in notebook later)
- create GPT manually with Airtable data and files from Google Drive
- (keep a txt or md or google doc file with the GPT fields in the Drive folder?)
- create mirror assistant and add to Airtable (w/ script)
- create test questions in Airtable and link to relevant GPT/Assistant pair
- get human to manually type questions into GPT
- automated run of questions for Assistant in notebook
- log output in Airtable table of tests?
    - need to have GPT send automatically as action
