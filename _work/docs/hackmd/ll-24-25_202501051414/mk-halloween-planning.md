- custom GPTs, Intelligence Augmentation, agents, roomba, etc.
- anthropic, notebookLM, chain of thought, retrieval, prompt engineering?
- colab with dall-e API, replicate API, loops and chains
- audio input, transcription and augmentation, slackbots
- image input, transformation, output, stable diffusion

### new things we need

- automated editing for Expos course (if possible connected to trailers)
- researcher and learner augmentation workflows
- python notebook resources for translation course
- other experiences translatable to translation course

### halloween themed

- costumes
- illustrations
- stories
- academic history / analysis

- buttons 
- pynb that generates images from multiple sources or with multiple prompts to compare and contrast (on the way to multiple translation rig)
- generate songs/music using [new tools](https://suno.com/)
- generate video from earlier-step stills in **runwayML**
- generate speech for **runwayML** in **ElevenLabs**
- create trailers for halloween movies
- grab speech for Voice Overs
- transcripts of speech sent to **Slack** and triggering/guiding bots
- **OpenAI Realtime API** proof of concept in multiple languages
- timecoded transcripts for analysis and editing
