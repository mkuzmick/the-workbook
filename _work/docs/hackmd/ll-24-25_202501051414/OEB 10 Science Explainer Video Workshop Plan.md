# OEB 10 Science Explainer Video Workshop Plan
**Focus:** How to structure a compelling two-minute video that explains scientific concepts with clarity and creativity, including basic editing techniques.

**Duration:** 75 minutes (5-minute intro, 60-minute activity, 5-minute closing)

---

## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
   - Welcome students, introduce workshop goals.
   - Frame the activity: How to effectively communicate scientific findings in a short, engaging video format.
   - Emphasize the practical impact of presenting research visually—how it broadens understanding.

## 2. Activity Portion (60 minutes)
   - **Part 1: Content Design (15 minutes)**
     - **Goal:** Outline what makes a two-minute video impactful.
     - **Discussion Points:**
       - **Hook:** Start with a reason to care. What’s interesting? Why should the audience pay attention?
       - **Content:** Highlight main points of the paper. 
       - **Broader Impacts:** End with why the research matters on a larger scale.
     - **Activity Example:** Have students brainstorm an opening “hook” for Figure 2, where they explain the experiment's relevance or a surprising finding.

   - **Part 2: Visual Design & Analogies (15 minutes)**
     - **Goal:** Show students ways to use visual aids to simplify complex information.
     - **Example Techniques:**
       - **Overhead Camera Setup:** Demonstrate how to set up a smartphone as an overhead camera to capture figures and diagrams. This could involve positioning the phone above a flat workspace with an easy setup like a stack of books or a small tripod.
       - **Analogies and Props:** Introduce the idea of using analogies or props. Ex) moving pieces like strings or pipe cleaners to represent data movement.
     - **Example Activity:** Have students explain elements of Figure 1 using physical objects. For instance, they could recreate an XY plot and adjust strings or markers to represent shifts in data points.
   
   - **Part 3: Hands-On Visual Creation (20 minutes)**
     - **Goal:** Practice translating figures into simple, visual explanations.
     - **Instructions:** Each student selects a panel from Figure 2 and explains it using an analogy or visual prop.
     - **Demonstration:** Show how small movements, like repositioning lines or props, can visually convey data changes over time.
     - **Activity:** Encourage them to create a short, 10-second video clip using their setup to reinforce the learning.
     - **Note on Phone Setup:** Consider re-demonstrating the phone-as-overhead-camera setup here to reinforce how they can record their explanation from above, capturing diagrams and props clearly.

   - **Part 4: Editing Basics (10 minutes)**
     - **Goal:** Demystify basic video editing techniques.
     - **Overview:** Briefly show how to:
       - Cut video clips and assemble them in sequence.
       - Add text or simple graphics.
       - Integrate a screenshot or sketch into the video for additional clarity.
     - **Tools Overview:** Mention free and accessible options like Canva, iMovie, Keynote, with Final Cut for more advanced needs.
     - **Follow-Up Resource:** Mention that they can email for further guidance, or get quick support if they encounter issues later on.

## 3. Wrap-Up and Next Steps (5 minutes)
   - Reiterate key takeaways: structure, visuals, editing.
   - Encourage them to experiment and reach out if they need further support.
