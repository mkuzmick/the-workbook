# DIY Overhead Camera Set-Up  ðŸ“·

We all love the Learning Lab's high-tech cameras, but did you know you can mimic them on your own? Here we've compiled a couple ways for you to create your own overhead camera with materials that we hope (fingers crossed) you have in your dorm (or a friend's)!

## 1. Book Stack
* **Materials**: books, ruler
* **Steps**:
    * Stack two piles of books with each stack roughly 5-6 inches above the surface you are recording
    * Place one or two sturdy rulers between the two stacks, moving the stacks as far apart from each other as you can while keeping the rulers stable (the longer the ruler the better!)
    * Place your phone on the rulers to record the surface below
        * **Pro Tip 1**: If the books are thick enough, you can stand them upright which requires less books than if you stack them horizontally on the table
        * **Pro Tip 2**: Water bottles work too if the tops are flat enough. Anything that can give your phone the height above the table is fair game. The main thing is to ensure that there is enough space between the two stacks so that you can film the surface below.

## 2. Through the Chair or Between the Chairs
* **Materials**: A chair with holes or two normal chairs (ideally flat)

#### For chair with holes:
* **Steps**:
    * Move your phone around until it is directly on top of one of the holes. You'll know you hit the sweet spot when you see the floor clearly without an obstruction from the rest of the chair! 

#### For two normal chairs
* **Steps**: 
    * Position two chairs facing each other and then balance your your phone between the chairs. Make sure there is a gap between the two chairs because that gap will be where you'll place the content you need to film. If this sounds confusing, please see the samples below!

## 3. Laptop Stand
* **Materials**: A Laptop or iPad/tablet with a cover (Android representation woohoo!) 
* **Steps**:
    * Open the laptop or tablet (+cover) roughly into an L-shape. It should be an acute angle or with 30-45Â° being roughly the sweet spot. The smaller the angle (aka the less you open your laptop), the less stable the stand is but the more your phone's camera can capture the surface
    * Place your phone on the makeshift stand
    * Enjoy
        * Pro Tip: it's practically inevitable that a little of your laptop will be seen unless the laptop is really small, so you can use some blank paper to cover your laptop if you don't want it there.

# 4. Get a friend to record for you
* Materials: A friend
* Steps: The title says it all

## General Tips
* When recording your video, check whether you are in potrait or landscape mode
    * Sometime when you place your phone onto your makeshift recording stands, you might be looking at your phone in landscape thinking that is how the camera is recording it but the video is still in potrait mode
    * A quick way to check this is to look at the orientation of the numbers showing your zoom level. If the number are vertically oriented, your phone is in potrait mode, and vice versa
    * Remember, just because you are looking at your phone in landscape/potrait doesn't mean that the camera is recording in that same orientation! The world is in 3D muhaha!
