# may-20-meeting


## quick show and tell

some of this can be part of the "what worked and what didn't" section
- main project zones
    - slackbots
        - as tutors
        - for testing and prototyping
        - multi-bot experiments
    - multimodal tools
        - sd
        - with physical world intersections (AFVS)
    - python notebooks as the new scratch
        - link to github repo
        - but also folder open
        - Gonzalo quote
        - an even bigger deal than we think?
- gaica support
    - interviews and reflections
    - integration with the rest of the Bok fellows and staff
- emergent phenomena
    - putting more people in touch with the tools earlier yields unexpected results
        - emr162, knowing what you're talking about & intellectual vitality
        - ballet
        - 



## next steps

- a team that puts together a google colab for every single new API method that gets released the very next day (and helps students and faculty experiment with it)
- but how to more systematically engineer points of contact between this experimental group of fellows and courses?
