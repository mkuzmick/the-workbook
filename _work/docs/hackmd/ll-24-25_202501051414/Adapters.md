# Adapters 

More than likely you've encountered adapters in your life. They're pretty common nowadays. We use a lot of adapters in the lab. Here are some of the ones we use regularly!

## Ethernet to USB-C

As defined by [docteck.com](https://www.dockteck.com/blogs/editors-picks/what-is-a-usb-c-to-ethernet-adapter) , this kind of adapter is, "***a device that allows you to connect your computer to an Ethernet network. USB-C is a new type of connector that is becoming increasingly popular on laptops and other devices. Many newer computers and laptops do not have an Ethernet port, so a USB-C to Ethernet adapter can be very useful.***

***The adapter has a male USB-C connector and a female Ethernet port on one end. You plug the USB-C end into your computer and the Ethernet end into an available Ethernet port on your router or network switch. The adapter will automatically create a connection between your computer and the network.***"

And that's exactly what we use them for in the learning lab! Ethernet is a wired connection to the network. It can give you a more reliable and sometimes faster connection than wifi.

## HDMI to USB-C

This kind of adapter can be used to connect a device to a tv or monitor. In the lab we might use this to connect someone's laptop to our system so they can display what's on their screen for a presentation or demonstration.

## USB to USB-C

Although USB-C is a very popular connector there are still devices that use USB connectors. Devices that use a USB connection can range from video game controllers, webcams, external drives, flashdrives, keyboards, mice, and printers.
