# project-space-and-systems

things:
* [the-space-and-systems-base](https://airtable.com/appLwnpnvgaY43U4s/tbl1yvAjrPAjq1heb/viwOM4K0T3tPP2jw5?blocks=hide)
    * getting mw/cc/mpas to help fill it out
        * compartments view grouped by units
* summer-work-base
    * tasks
    * slackusers
    * workers
    * slacks
    * img2md
* Work in progress channel for dd/mk for testing (where to parse and deposit these ideas)
    * we'll go with the work channel
## some initial feature requests for our work channel (an everything bin - that would do its best to parse it) (will be LL wide viewable, so nothing super secret)
* pinterest/lookbook thing
* slack every time an event gets added to ll-plan (so we can get rid of zapier) - make notes on meeting there that would update records, etc.

## wishlist for python coding (things that we used to have an airtable script to do - that run once in a while, that we want to have a lot of control on)
* google cal to airtable?
* doc creations

## other notes
* mk/dd figure out the systems plan
    * what is the goal of each thing we're tracking? (ie. events base mess, what do we actually need)
    * project base and responsibilities
