# AL and CD planning doc

## chunks
* academic essay: what it is and how it works
    * understanding structure
    * analyzing the function of different elements
    * students often having to do this
    * alternatives to this: academic explainer video
    * need to understand how bits of the essay and the bits of the video are related - and how to communicate effectively in the form of the explainer video
* deconstructing the academic paper
    * find an example related to your research
* looking at a model of an explainer video
    * nyt jellyfish (below)
* discuss how the functional elements of the video essay relate to academic "moves" in the disciplines
    * one example of a move is in the video is being able to visualize concepts or processes that are very challenging to explain with words alone - or can at least be more effectively communicated with visuals
* use art supplies to illustrate one of these difficult concepts from your research
    * aim to explain it in 1 minute or less
    * have them think about crafting verbal analogies and crafting visual analogies (how can you intentionally craft what you say and what you see so that they work together to enhance understanding)
* contextualizing this concept in a video storyboarding activity
    * map out the plan for a longer video
    * what other contexts would you cover
    * and what would someone see on screen at each chunk
    * look at your storyboard: How does the storyboard progression compare to the academic essay structure? what parts of the academic essay do you want to make sure you "have" in the video essay (e.g., you should probably still have a thesis, you probably will want discussion and results if you're in STEM, etc.)
* video editing
    * CD show them Prelinger archives
