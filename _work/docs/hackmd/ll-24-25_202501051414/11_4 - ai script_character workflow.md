Eleven Labs 
- Eleven Labs has existing voices you can use, or you can create a voice of your own! 
- Go to three lines in the top right corner, then go to voices, then add a new voice 
- You can select either voice design (design an entirely new voice from a text prompt) or instant voice clone (clone your voice with only a few minutes of audio)

Voice Design
- In the prompt category, enter a description of what you want your voice to sound like. Be as detailed as possible (ie. gender, tone, raspiness, volume, etc.)
- Next, add some text to preview the voice. You must enter at least 100 characters.
- Then, press generate voice. After taking a second to load, you will receive three voice options based on the prompt. Take a second to listen to each of them and pick which one fits the closest to what you want. 
- If none of them do, add some more detail to the prompt and start again.
- If you like one of the options, click select voice. 
- Then, you can name and save the voice. Specify the language under "Value." 

Speech Synthesis
- Next, you can use the voice that you have created to read out some of a script, or text you have written. Next to the name, press use - and it will take you to a blank page.  
- After writing out your text, generate speech. 
- Next, download the audio pressing the download icon to the right of the audio clip that is generated. Next, we will move onto ChatGPT.

ChatGPT
- Use ChatGPT to generate an image. Be as specific as possible in your description. Go through a couple rounds of image generation and editing until you get the character that you are looking for. 

RunwayML
- RunwayML lets you generate expressive character performances. We will be using this platform to combine the image you generated on ChatGPT with the voice and audio clip you generated in ElevenLabs, to create a character that's actually talking.
- Utilize the Lip Sync Video feature.
- Upload the ChatGPT  image, and the audio clip you created. 
- Wait a few minutes for the video to generate, and you're done!
