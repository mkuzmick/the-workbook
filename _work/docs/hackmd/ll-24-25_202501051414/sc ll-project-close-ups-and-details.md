# sc ll-project-close-ups-and-details

## What am I trying to build?

I am trying to build 3D models that represent things in the lab. 
Examples of this could be:
* Modeling the carts and what's inside. Explaining what each piece does/is for
* Modeling storage room 1. Specifically the bins and what each one holds and what the things inside are for.

The user can click on objects and get a little tid bit of info on it.

### What else can this relate to?

It could relate back to the ll-project-paths-etc week. A website that follows a road of some sort, showcasing students' work. It could be an actual road or a gallery.

I hope if I can make a website then the code can be reused for any type of projects that would be interesting to showcase in a digital space. An example would be if a course has students turning in video projects, it would be cool to have some kind of gallery/theater themed website for the students to view

## How will I build it?
### Tools: 
1. Blender - to build the models

3. three.js - to construct the website

### Time Needed:
1. Building models are not necessarily difficult. An example would be building the bins in storage room 1. That should take maybe 30 - 45 minutes if we are going for a more intricate design. There's also the option of 3D scanning objects versus modeling them from scratch. Personally, I use the box modeling method which speeds up the process, rather than modeling the traditional way they do for video games. I model the simple shapes quickly, rather than making a model from a singular mesh (like a whole character from one cube). That being said it is about the number of objects I'm building. I would start with 3 bins first. 
2. I got through the basics but would need to review them for three.js. Bringing in blender models is considered more advanced. It does take a bit of time to understand. 


## Easily accomplished
#### Method 1: Building models in blender and doing a simple animation showcasing the model. Ex: Bin, cables inside, individual cable with a description about it.
#### Method 2: The same as method 1 but instead of from scratch I would 3D scan objects. The difficulty with this is that the scans can be messy. This would be hard to animate.

Example of what would appear when clicking on the object: 
**What is an HDMI cable?**
HDMI means High-Definition Multimedia Interface, a standard for simultaneously transmitting digital video and audio from a source, such as a computer or TV cable box, to a computer monitor, TV or projector. (link to source of this definition: https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/products/backup-power-ups-surge-it-power-distribution/backup-power-ups-it-power-distribution-resources/cpdi-vertical-marketing/hdmi-explained.html)
**What do we use them for at the learning lab?**
We use them to connect tvs, computers, and cameras into our system! We use HDMI cables regularly. We have very short HDMIs (less than 1 foot long) to very long HDMI cables (50 feet long) depending on our needs. The are usually used with our converter boxes! (link to converter box info/3D model)

## Stretch Goal

 Bringing models onto a website using three.js so the user could click on and observe objects at their leisure with descriptions of the object
