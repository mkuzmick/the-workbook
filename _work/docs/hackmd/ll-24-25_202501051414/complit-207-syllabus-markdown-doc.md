## Course Description  

It has become commonplace to observe that we live in a digital society. But what are its laws of motion? Do they vary from place to place? And what role do specific technologies play in mediating them? Since at least the nineteenth century, computation and capitalism have co-evolved with each other. Computers have served capital by creating new modes of accumulation, automating labor, and facilitating advertising and transactions. Yet, they have also been described as fundamentally changing or overcoming capitalism—for better or worse.  

In this seminar, we will engage with recent scholarship theorizing digital capitalism and culture, paired with canonical texts cited by these works. Students will explore key concepts, debates, and methods in new media studies, critical data studies, and platform studies while reflecting on the purpose of theorizing. Assignments will guide students in identifying a research topic, reviewing scholarly literature, articulating a research question, and writing a review essay or research paper.
