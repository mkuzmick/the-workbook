# Reaction Video Mechanics 
## Visual Style
- College Reaction Videos
    * Multiple schools (usually shown in thumbnail too)
    * sometimes has two screens, one showing the person reacting and also another screen recording of the person's computer as they open the email
    * Usually includes an intro to who they are, reaction on seeing the results and post celebration/devastation
    * Sometimes followed or preceded by application stats, co-curriculars etc. (might also be a separate video) 

- Video Game Reaction Videos
    * A smaller video of the gamer accompanied by a larger video of the game so that people can see the gameplay and the gamer react in real time/as things happen (sometimes live) 

- Sports meme reactions (eg. Shaqtin' a Fool)
    * Reactions are in the background while the main clip takes up the whole screen
    * Reactions are ranked and progressive (top 5, top 10 etc.)

- Professional reacts to XYZ (Insider is a great channel for this)
    * Examples include a Mafia expert reacting to Mafia scenes in movies or chefs reacting to cooking scenes in movies
    * Two main formats (movie scene big screen with reactor in a small overlaid window and vice versa, fullscreen)

- Podcast Format (Music/Audio)
    * Two people wear headphones with a microphone in between and chat back and forth. 
    * An on-screen image somewhere of an album cover for reference. 
    * Could apply to video watching, but better for auditory files.
