# slavic 189 podcast planning

## the assignment
* 

## ideas
* pre-interviewing
* interviewing
* how to react to what people are saying in a way that's productive
* active listening
* introduce unorthodox parts of their bio
    * ex.: you know how to ballroom dance
    * how to get folks to talk about these aspects of themselves
* soundbite as poesis
    * a poesis - you're drawing lines out from the interview and extracting
* could have them trim out the parts of the interview that are the soundbites
* recursive
    * you hear the intro music
    * a part of the dialogue
    * then more intermediary stuff
    * and then you go into the interview and you hear the part that is quoted before - actually embedded in the dialogue and it repeats

## the plan
* unpacking serial
* pre-interviewing
    * what topics, concepts, ideas would you use to structure a podcast episode about the interview this week in class
    * write out on cards some possible conversation topics, maybe even questions you'd ask to each other to get a convo about this event going
    * how will you get a SOUNDBITE
* 
* then they can record this using their phones
* and then we can bring those recordings into GB
    * and then they can decide on music (that has significance, etc.)
    * and then find that soundbite
    * trim the audio 
* could have different mics going into the computers so they could experiment with different audio quality
    * could trim the bits of prose they like and are using to analyze 

## interviewing notes
Podcasts frequently take the form of an interview, with the podcast host(s) asking guests questions in an intentional way. At this station, we'll talk about some of the techniques to keep in mind when interviewing. 

* preparing for the interview:
    * choose guests intentionally
    * research them in advance
    * have a bio and introduce them
    * consider why and how will the interviewee connect with the intended audience
* the interview questions:
    * avoid ask yes/no questions
    * or leading questions ("and so would you say that's what made the class so awesome")---give them freedom
    * aim for "how" and "why" questions
        * ask for elaboration---it's OK to be confused and to want to know (remember: you are the listener's proxy in the room) 
    * the interview is a story, think about story-order (rather than order of coolness or importance)
    * ask one question at a time
    * don't talk over them
    * listen actively to their answers (don't just wait for your turn to talk again)
    * send the questions in advance if you can!
    * save time for a pre-interview orienting conversation if possible
     * find an interviewer you really like and pay attention to their process the next time you listen to one of their interviews
