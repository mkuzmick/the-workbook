# Alex's Slavic AI Assignment Examples

**Leveraging AI**

AI models (in this case, Large Language Models and Diffusion Models) excel at specific tasks like pattern recognition, text transformation, and processing large volumes of data. These capabilities can be harnessed to analyze complex texts, explore linguistic nuances, and visualize literary themes. By integrating AI thoughtfully, students can focus on crafting strong arguments and conducting deep analyses.

## Some Assignment and Activity Ideas

These examples highlight some ways to use AI tools to perform a deep analysis of selected works by Russian Golden Age writers.

### 1. Translation Assistance with GPT Models
Using GPTs, via Harvard's ChatGPT Edu workspace, you can translate selected passages (this could be done in and between multiple languages).
* **Students can use AI translation tools to help them work more closely with the original Russian**. Students could also compare the AI-generated translation with existing human translations, noting differences in tone, style, and accuracy.
* **GPTs can be prompted to provide commentary on single or multiple translations**, discussing stylistic choices, linguistic nuances, and how they affect the interpretation of the text. This metacommentary could then be annotated and edited by the student, if it's useful to see how the student reflects on the choices a human versus machine translator makes.

### 2. Visual Representation through AI Image Generation

AI tools can **generate images** depicting key scenes or symbols from the text or that illustrate claims.
* These images could serve as illustrations for a creative narrative project, paired with a critical assessment or artist's statement reflecting on the overall creative process. 
* These images could also be used as visuals in a multimodal  assignment, like a video essay, particularly if images are used to illustrate or accompany substantive analytical claims. 

### 3. Large-scale Data Analysis

Students can **use AI to parse large data sets of text** (hundreds of thousands of words) using Python notebooks and other AI tools like NotebookLM. Though these AI models can assist students in accruing data, it will be important for the students to do the work of actual interpretation using these data: how do these patterns enhance the understanding of themes and character dynamics?
* AI-augmented data analysis could be used to perform  close readings of plot, word choice, imagery, and characters across a huge corpus (and students could also parse what "memes" or  have been created within the text?) or be more psychoanalytic/ethnographic (why are are some elements that have held constant while others are changed?). 
* Students could analyze linguistic patterns such as word frequency, sentence structure, or use of literary devices in a given text. 

### 4. Creative "Rewriting" and Fanfiction

Students could **generate a fanfiction chapter based on the original literary work using AI**. 
* Students could revise the AI-generated text to align with authentic character voices, qualities, and plot coherence. 
* Students could also annotate the AI-generated fanfiction to demonstrate their understanding of key facets of the original literary work.
* Students could upload a large corpus of text, like fanfiction for a given text across multiple languages, then perform analysis on the trends within this corpus. This is essentially a form of data analysis.

### 5. Phonetic and Metrical Exploration

Students can use AI tools to **identify interesting instances of rhythm, rhyme, and sound patterns in the original text.** AI tools can be used to help assess how the phonetic qualities and metric structure contribute to the overall impact of a given passage.
* Using AI, it's possible to compare these findings with how such elements are preserved or altered in translation.
* These translations or the original can then be transformed into audio via a range of AI tools (elevenlabs, OpenAI, etc.)
