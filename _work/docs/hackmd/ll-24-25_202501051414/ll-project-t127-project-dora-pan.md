## AI-Assisted Chatbots
Through this project, students will develop and refine AI-driven chatbots designed to support FAS courses. Forms range from custom OpenAI GPTs to assistants deployed across Jupyter Notebooks and Slack Channels. Given the dynamic landscape of emerging AI tools, this project will be geared toward exploring and experimenting with a range of AI tools and developing documentation that can guide others through a similar exploration. Students will contribute by testing chatbot functionalities, providing feedback for improvements, and developing user guides for effective implementation.
