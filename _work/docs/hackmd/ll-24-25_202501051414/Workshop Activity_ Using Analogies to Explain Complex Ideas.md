# Workshop Activity: Using Analogies to Explain Complex Ideas

## Title: Simplifying Complexity: Crafting Analogies and Visual Analogies

**Objective:** Help students develop analogies and visual analogies to make complex scientific ideas from the paper more accessible to a general audience.

**Introduction to Analogies** (5 minutes)

"Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into the art of analogies. Analogies are a powerful tool for explaining complex ideas by comparing them to something familiar and easier to understand. When dealing with scientific concepts, especially those found in academic papers, it's essential to find ways to translate that complexity into something our audience can easily grasp.

Think of analogies as bridges—they connect the unfamiliar to the familiar, helping people cross from confusion to understanding. In today’s session, we’ll not only be crafting verbal analogies but also thinking about how we can use visual analogies to enhance our explainer videos."

**Breaking down an example**


Suggested Video:
Title: How Does Your Immune System Work? - Emma Bryce
Link: [How Does Your Immune System Work? | TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSRJfaAYkW4&t=78s)
Duration: 4 minutes and 55 seconds


To help students think critically about the communication techniques, or "moves," being made in the TED-Ed video, you can ask guiding questions that encourage them to analyze the content, structure, and presentation. Here are some questions you might consider:

**Guiding questions**
1. Identifying the Hook
How does the video grab your attention in the first few seconds?
What techniques are used to make the opening engaging or relatable?
Why do you think the creator chose this particular way to introduce the topic?
2. Simplifying Complex Concepts
How does the video break down complex ideas into simpler components?
What analogies or metaphors are used to make scientific concepts more accessible?
Can you identify any specific language choices that help make the content easier to understand?
3. Visual and Verbal Integration
How do the visuals complement or enhance what’s being said?
Are there any points in the video where the visuals help clarify a concept that might be difficult to understand through words alone?
How do the visuals and narration work together to reinforce the main idea?
4. Structure and Flow
What structure does the video use to present the information (e.g., problem-solution, cause-effect)?
How does the video ensure that each part of the explanation logically leads to the next?
Can you spot any transitional phrases or elements that help guide the viewer through the content smoothly?
5. Engaging the Audience
How does the video keep the audience engaged throughout?
Are there any moments that stand out as particularly engaging or thought-provoking? Why?
What role do pacing and tone of voice play in maintaining interest?
6. Emphasizing Key Points
What techniques does the video use to emphasize the most important points?
How does the video signal to the viewer that something is especially important or worth remembering?
Are there any repetitions or summaries that help reinforce key messages?
7. Audience Consideration
Who do you think is the intended audience for this video?
How does the video tailor its content and style to be appropriate for this audience?
What assumptions does the video make about what the audience already knows or doesn’t know?
8. Call to Action or Conclusion
How does the video conclude?
Is there a call to action, or does it leave the viewer with a particular thought or question?
How effectively does the conclusion wrap up the main idea or message of the video?
9. Reflecting on Effectiveness
What do you think are the strongest elements of the video’s communication strategy?
Is there anything you would change or improve to make the video more effective?
What can you learn from this video that you could apply to your own explainer videos?

**Step 1: Identifying Complex Ideas** (10 minutes)

"Let’s start by revisiting the scientific paper we’re focusing on. I want you to spend a few minutes identifying at least two concepts from the paper that you find particularly complex or challenging to explain. These could be specific terms, processes, or findings.

Once you’ve identified your concepts, write them down, and be ready to share one with the group."

[Give students time to review the paper and jot down their ideas.]

---

**Step 2: Crafting Verbal Analogies** (15 minutes)

"Now that we have our complex concepts, let’s brainstorm some analogies. An analogy compares two things that are otherwise different but share some underlying similarity.

For example, if you were trying to explain the concept of species richness affecting ecosystem resilience, you might compare it to a toolbox. Just like having a variety of tools in a toolbox makes you better prepared to fix different problems, having a diverse array of species in an ecosystem makes it more resilient to environmental changes.

Take a few minutes to think of an analogy for one of your complex concepts. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect at first—just try to find a familiar concept or object that shares some similarity with the idea from the paper."

[Allow students time to brainstorm and then ask them to share their analogies with the group.]

**Discussion Prompt:** "What makes these analogies effective or challenging? How do they help in simplifying the original concept?"

---

**Step 3: Creating Visual Analogies** (15 minutes)

"Now let’s take it a step further by thinking visually. Visual analogies are like illustrations for your analogy—they help to convey the idea not just through words, but through images or diagrams that your audience can see.

For example, if we use the toolbox analogy, a visual analogy might be an image of a toolbox with different tools labeled as various species, and another image showing how using different tools can solve different problems, much like how various species contribute to ecosystem stability.

Think about the analogy you’ve crafted and consider how you could represent it visually. What images, diagrams, or animations could you use in your explainer video to reinforce the analogy?

Sketch out a rough idea of your visual analogy. Remember, it doesn’t have to be a work of art—just something that helps convey the idea visually."

[Give students time to sketch out their visual analogies and then invite them to share and discuss.]

**Discussion Prompt:** "How does the visual analogy support or enhance the verbal analogy? What additional clarity does it provide?"

---

**Step 4: Refinement and Feedback** (10 minutes)

"Finally, we’ll spend a few minutes refining our analogies. Work in pairs to share your verbal and visual analogies, and give each other feedback. Is the analogy clear? Does the visual aid help in understanding the concept? How could it be improved?

Use this time to tweak your analogies based on the feedback you receive."

[Facilitate a short feedback session where pairs can work together.]

**Wrap-Up** (5 minutes)

"Great work, everyone! Today, you’ve taken a crucial step in learning how to make complex scientific ideas more accessible through analogies. By bridging the gap between the abstract and the familiar, you’re making science more understandable and engaging for your audience.

Remember, the power of an analogy lies in its ability to connect with people on a level they already understand. As you continue working on your explainer videos, keep thinking about how you can use analogies—both verbal and visual—to communicate your ideas more effectively."
