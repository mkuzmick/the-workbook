* tarot cards
    * first part of the station can be "getting a tarot card reading"
        * chat completions from an OpenAI assistant that specifically return a certain number of cards in a specific spread, text-to-voice by elevenlabs?
    * then generating, from replicate, a "major arcana" card representing the person 
        * this could be part of the workflow where we take a photo of them, put it through CV description, then feed that into a prompt for the card (and maybe this prompt and/or the "title" of their card is based around their initial reading?)
    * see if we can print with cardstock at Adams (make them a tarot card size)

* "scary stories to tell in the dark" 
    * starting with the "character" information from entry 
        * transform this into a longer tale 
    * tale is used to make a voice form elevenlabs 
    * recording is fed through elevenlabs or runwayML to make a video
