# Workshop Plan: Storyboarding for Scientific Communication
## Date: 2024-08-13

## Introduction (5 minutes)

**[Instructor begins speaking]**

“Welcome, everyone! Today, we’re going to dive into the world of **visual storytelling**, specifically within the context of scientific communication. Let’s start by thinking about this: **Why do you think visuals are important when communicating complex scientific ideas to a broader audience?**

[Pause for student responses.]

Exactly! The power of visuals lies in their ability to **make complex ideas accessible** and engaging, which is key when you’re trying to reach a broader audience. But let’s take this a step further. **When you’re watching a video, what keeps you engaged? How do you think the creators ensure that each part of the video connects logically to the next?**

[Pause for student responses.]

Great points! That’s where storyboarding comes in—it’s the tool that helps creators **bridge the gap** between complicated data and clear understanding, ensuring that the narrative flows smoothly and keeps the audience engaged.

Before we dive into storyboarding, let’s reflect on planning in general. **Can anyone think of a situation where planning in advance has helped you in your academic or personal projects? How might this apply to creating a video?**

[Pause for student responses.]

Exactly, planning helps you **organize your thoughts** and stay on track, which is critical when communicating complex information. Think of a storyboard as the **blueprint for your video**—just like an architect wouldn’t build a house without detailed plans, you shouldn’t create a video without a storyboard. It helps you **streamline your message** and ensures that your audience can follow the narrative you’re constructing.

Now, imagine trying to create a video without a storyboard. **What challenges do you think you might face if you tried to create a video without a storyboard?**

[Pause for student responses.]

Right, without a clear plan, it’s easy to lose focus, miss key points, or end up with a disjointed narrative. That’s why storyboarding is so essential—it helps you structure your content logically, ensuring that each part of your narrative connects seamlessly to the next. In this way, your storyboard becomes the tool that **guides your audience** through your scientific story.

As we move forward today, think about this: **How can turning scientific data into a story help your audience understand and remember the information better?** And more importantly, **think about a research paper you’ve read recently. How could you break down its key points into a story? What scenes or visuals come to mind?**

[Pause for student responses.]

These are the kinds of questions we’ll be answering together as we look at a real-world example of how storyboarding can transform research into a compelling story. By breaking down a scientific video and its corresponding storyboard, you’ll see how each scene was carefully planned to enhance the message. This is exactly what you’ll be doing later on—**transforming research into a compelling story** through your own storyboards.

So, let’s get started and think about how your research or the papers you read can be presented as a clear and engaging story. Your storyboard will be your guide, helping you to achieve **effective communication** of your ideas.”





# Outline

## Step 1: Introduction
Time: 5 minutes
Content: Start with a brief introduction to the importance of visual storytelling in science communication. You might mention how a clear visual plan can help make complex scientific ideas more accessible to a broader audience.

## Step 2: Example Breakdown
Time: 12 minutes
Content: Choose a specific scientific video (preferably based on a paper) to analyze. Break down its storyboard, explaining how each scene supports the overall message. Highlight key elements like the introduction, the main content, and the conclusion.
Visual Aid: Show the actual video alongside its storyboard, if possible, to help students visualize the planning process.

1. Understanding the Purpose of Each Scene
“As we watch this first scene, what do you think the creators are trying to convey? Why do you think they chose to start the video this way?”
This question encourages students to think about the intention behind the opening scene and how it sets the stage for the rest of the video.
2. Connecting Visuals to the Message
“What do you notice about the visuals used in this part of the video? How do they help communicate the scientific concept being discussed?”
This helps students analyze how visual elements reinforce or clarify the content being presented.
3. Transition and Flow
“How does the transition between these two scenes contribute to the overall narrative? Does it feel smooth, and if so, why?”
This prompts students to think about the importance of smooth transitions in maintaining the flow and coherence of the video.
4. Emphasizing Key Points
“What techniques do you see being used here to emphasize the main points? Are there any visuals or narration choices that stand out to you?”
This question helps students identify how the creators highlight crucial information to ensure it resonates with the audience.
5. Structure and Narrative
“Looking at the storyboard, how does the structure of this video compare to the traditional narrative arc we discussed earlier? Where do you see the introduction, the main content, and the conclusion fitting in?”
This encourages students to map the video’s structure onto the narrative arc, helping them see the importance of having a clear beginning, middle, and end.
6. Conclusion and Call to Action
“How does the video wrap up its message? What kind of impression does the conclusion leave on you, and how might this influence the audience’s understanding or actions?”
This helps students consider how a strong conclusion can leave a lasting impact and encourage the audience to take action or think differently.
7. Applying to Their Work
“Based on this breakdown, what elements do you think are most important to consider when creating your own storyboard? How might you apply these techniques to your own project?”
This final question prompts students to reflect on the example and consider how they can use similar techniques in their own storyboards.
These questions should guide your students through a deep analysis of the example video and its storyboard, helping them to understand the thought process behind each scene and how it contributes to effective scientific communication.

## Step 3: Interactive Q&A
Time: 6 minutes
Content: Open the floor for questions. Encourage students to think about how they can apply the same principles to their own storyboards.

## Step 4: Transition to Prototyping
Time: 1 minute
Content: Wrap up the set piece by transitioning into the hands-on part of the workshop. Briefly explain what they'll be doing next and how they can start sketching their ideas.
