# Workshop Script: Museums and Collection Histories

---

**1. Introduction to Workshop (10-15 minutes)**

**Facilitator:**
“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! Thanks for joining today’s workshop on Museums and Collection Histories. We’re going to spend some time exploring how museums shape our understanding of history and culture through their collections. By the end of this session, you’ll be working in groups to create your own digital archive or propose a museum exhibition using photos you’ve taken throughout the semester.”

**[Pause for any initial reactions or questions.]**

**Facilitator:**
“To kick things off, I want to take you on a virtual tour of the *Musée d’Orsay* in Paris. This museum is housed in a former railway station, which gives it a unique architectural feel. It’s known for its collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. As we go through this tour, pay attention to how the space itself influences your experience of the art and how the layout might impact the stories that the museum tells.”

**[Facilitator begins the virtual tour of the Musée d’Orsay via Google Arts & Culture. As you navigate through the museum, offer commentary on key aspects, such as the building’s history, specific artworks, and the flow of the exhibition spaces.]**

**Facilitator:**
“For example, notice how the large, open spaces of the former train station create a different atmosphere compared to more traditional gallery spaces. How do you think this affects the way we perceive the artwork displayed here? Take a moment to consider how the arrangement and architecture guide your experience.”

**[After touring a few key areas, pause to engage the students.]**

**Facilitator:**
“Let’s stop here for a moment and discuss. What stood out to you about how the Musée d’Orsay presents its collection? How did the architecture and layout of the museum influence your perception of the art? Does this change or expand your understanding of what a museum can be?”

**[Allow students to share their thoughts and facilitate a brief discussion based on their observations.]**

**Facilitator:**
“Great points! What we’re seeing is how the design and curation choices made by the museum influence not just what we see, but how we see it. This is something to keep in mind as you move into the next part of the workshop.”

**2. Group Breakout Session (50 minutes)**

**Facilitator:**
“Now it’s your turn to step into the role of a curator. In your groups, you’ll be creating a digital archive or proposing a museum exhibition based on the photos you’ve taken throughout the semester. Your task is to think critically about how to arrange these images to tell a story or explore a theme.”

**[Pause to ensure everyone understands the task.]**

**Facilitator:**
“Start by reviewing your photos and selecting those that best fit the theme you want to explore. Once you’ve chosen your images, think about how you can organize them to create a cohesive narrative. You can use tools like Google Slides, Padlet, or Canva to build your digital archive or exhibition proposal. Remember, the goal is not just to display images, but to convey a story or idea through them.”

**[Allow students to begin their group work. Circulate among the groups, offering guidance and answering any questions they may have.]**

**Facilitator:**
“Don’t hesitate to ask if you need help with anything, whether it’s a technical question or ideas on how to structure your narrative.”

**3. Group Presentations and Wrap-Up (10-15 minutes)**

**Facilitator:**
“Alright, let’s come back together and hear what you’ve created. Each group will have 2-3 minutes to present your digital archive or exhibition proposal. Focus on the theme you chose, why you selected certain images, and the story you’re trying to tell.”

**[Groups present their work. Encourage a supportive and constructive atmosphere during the presentations.]**

**Facilitator:**
“Those were some fantastic presentations. Now, let’s reflect a bit. What did you find challenging about curating your collection? How did this exercise change your understanding of the role of museums in shaping narratives?”

**[Facilitate a brief discussion, allowing students to share their experiences and insights.]**

**Facilitator:**
“To wrap up, I want to leave you with this thought: Museums are powerful spaces where history, art, and culture intersect, and as curators, you have the ability to shape how these stories are told. I hope this exercise has given you a new perspective on the importance of curation and the impact it has on how we understand the world around us. Thanks for your active participation today—I’m really looking forward to seeing how you apply these ideas in the rest of the course!”
