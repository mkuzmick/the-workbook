### **Student-Facing Document: Why You’re Doing This Assignment & Tips for Success**

**Why This Assignment?**

In this course, your exhibition or curation project offers a unique opportunity to:

1.  **Share Your Learning with the World**  
    This assignment challenges you to communicate historical ideas to diverse audiences, not just academic historians. Learning to convey complex ideas in accessible ways is a valuable skill in any field.
2.  **Show What You’ve Learned**  
    Unlike a paper that might focus narrowly on one topic, this project lets you demonstrate your understanding of the big picture. You’ll synthesize what you’ve learned throughout the course into a cohesive and creative presentation.  
3.  **Explore New Ways to Communicate**  
    With technology like AI changing the way we write and create, this assignment encourages you to experiment with new tools and mediums. It’s a chance to push your creative boundaries while developing skills that are increasingly relevant in today’s world.   
4.  **Engage with History Creatively**  
    Museums and exhibits are designed to communicate historical narratives, making them a natural fit for this course. By creating your own exhibit, you’ll critically engage with this tradition while learning to shape narratives yourself.
    
**Tips for Success**

1.  **Start with the Big Ideas**  
    Think about the central themes or stories you want your exhibit to communicate. Build around these key ideas to ensure your project stays focused and meaningful.   
2.  **Plan Your Time**  
    Learning new tools like Blender, Unity, or Unreal can take time. Be realistic about how much you can accomplish. Consult with learning lab staff to identify the fastest way to achieve your goals without overburdening yourself.   
3.  **Use Your Resources**  
    Don’t hesitate to reach out for help! Whether it’s brainstorming ideas or troubleshooting tech issues, support is available. Learning lab staff can guide you through the process and help you find the shortest path to success.  
4.  **Balance Creativity with Practicality**  
    While it’s exciting to dive into new software or ambitious designs, remember the main goal is to showcase your understanding of the course material. Keep the technical aspects manageable so they don’t distract from the content.  
5.  **Iterate and Refine**  
    Draft your exhibit early and get feedback. Whether it’s from peers, instructors, or learning lab staff, input will help you create a polished and compelling final product.
    

**Final Thoughts**

This assignment is more than just a project—it’s an opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in a meaningful, creative way. Take advantage of the chance to experiment and explore, and don’t forget to reach out for support when you need it. You’ve got this!
