## concept 

* red
    * ChatGPT Edu interface? 
        * or just Ai-augmented tools that people already use? 
            * photoshop, Canva, google search, etc. 
* orange
    * ChatGPT Edu fully (if we go more basic for red) 
        * OR solely GPTs 
            * GPTs + Actions 
* yellow
    * other AI tools 
        * NotebookLM, etc. 
    * this could be a "theory"-focused station. Once they get through the fun basics, this is where they can think more deeply about the best applications of AI and how to use it well. Sets up the more technically advanced stations to follow.
* green
    * python notebooks
        * connect to airtable, multi-step process prototype (maybe the rubric one), etc.
* blue
    * "podcasting" zone with live translation and transcription
        * slackbots
* purple 
    * overhead camera 
        * CV models + studio machine 
            * slackbots continued
        * the future of physical spaces augmented by AI
