# key ideas from readings
some notes prepping for MDF orientation

## ian afflerbach PMLA article on selling out
* short stories of Nam Le a vehicle for broader cultural, social, historical, political debates about ethnic essentialism vs authenticity, selling out vs strategic essentialism, commercialization vs professionalization, etc.
* 3 phases of "selling out" mapped via text here
    * james's lack of commercial success accuring cultural capital that made his fiction more enduring (past and present sacrifice during his life pays off in this transitional to canonical fiction)
    * program era/McGurl/Iowa Workshop and other unis professionalizing practice of (at times) Jamesian narrative techniques (at risk of homogenizing cultural production)
    * global literature era and global spread of anglophone fiction
* politics of recognition vs remuneration a key theoretical distinction
    * could lend itself well to some kind of infographic that differentiates these two very close (and sometimes overlapping) but ultimately distinct concepts (important because in Afflerbach's argument, the shift from the former to the latter is part of the historical trajectory he charts)
* Bourdieu a major theoretical figure for Afflerbach
    * Bourdieu's concepts already visualized, benefit from visualizations
    * to see the field of cultural production makes it easier to grasp
* something interesting about the temporal/pacing/sequencing of literary studies arguments
    * which often require the reader to state one position
    * then follow the implications of that claim
    * and then often contest or point out a contradiction in that claim given what we know (sometimes this comes in the form of pointing out that, say, what the fiction does at the level of narrative is in tension with dominant social and political structures, etc.)
    * but you have to progress through this, get into the deepness of the claim and move through its parts IN A SEQUENCE
    * it could be cool to think about how you might marshal media forms that deploy sequencing in this way (or lean into oral forms like presentations and performace to give students this embodied experience of advancing claims that must be in the order their in for maximum legibility/comprehension/effect)
    * pp. 236 - "Selling Out in the Program Era" really where this seems evident to me ("the program era's privileged values--creativity and experience--do produce two attendant worries...")
## dana luciano
* theoretical concepts would benefit from visualization that charts the temporal sequence central to idea of "kinship time"
* many instances of the thing something multimodal forms like video/montage primed to do

## [Historical Thinking and other Unnatural Acts](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1177/003172171009200420)

"But in viewing the past as usable, as something that speaks to us without intermediary or translation, we end up turning it into yet another commodity for our instant consumption. We discard or just ignore vast regions of the past that either contradict our current needs or fail to align easily with them. To be sure, the past retains a certain fascination. But it is the fascination of the flea market, with its endless array of gaudy trinkets and antique baubles. Because we know more or less what we're looking for before we enter this past, our encounter is unlikely to change us or cause us to rethink who we are. The past becomes clay in our hands. We are not called upon to stretch our understanding in order to learn from the past. Instead, we contort the past to fit the predetermined meaning we have already assigned to it."
* idea that we want learning to stretch students' understanding
* not just give them a forum for recapitulating what they already think (and think they know)
* not about demonstrating but about comprehending deeply
* learning something you didn't know before, seeing something you couldn't see before
* can working in other media estrange what we think we know? can we use these tools to get us to a new understanding?
