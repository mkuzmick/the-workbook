# Slavic AI Assignment Examples

**Leveraging AI**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a plethora of opportunities to deepen engagement with literature, not by replacing student outputâ€” but by transforming and enriching it. AI models (in this case, Large Language Models and Diffusion Models) excel at specific tasks like pattern recognition, text transformation, and processing large volumes of data. These capabilities that can be harnessed to analyze complex texts, explore linguistic nuances, and visualize literary themes. By integrating AI thoughtfully, students can focus on crafting strong arguments, conducting deep analyses, and creating novel approaches/workflows, while technology aids in unveiling new dimensions of their chosen subjects.

## Example Assignment

**Objective:** Utilize various AI tools to perform a deep analysis of a selected work by Anton Chekhov.

Below is a range of AI-based approaches for an assignment of this type: 

### 1. Translation Assistance with GPT Models

- **AI-Assisted Translation:** Use GPTs, via Harvard's ChatGPT Edu workspace, to translate selected passages (this could be done in and between multiple languages)
    - **Meta-Commentary and Stylistic Notes:** GPTs could be prompted to provide commentary on the translation, discussing stylistic choices, linguistic nuances, and how they affect the interpretation of the text.
        - This metacommentary could then be annotated and edited by the student, as one of the final products of this assignment.
    - **Comparative Analysis:** Similar to the annotation of AI-produced meta-commentary, students could also compare the AI translation with existing human translations, noting differences in tone, style, and accuracy.

### 2. Visual Representation through AI Image Generation

- **Image Creation:** Employ AI tools to generate images depicting key scenes or symbols from the text. These images could form the bulk of a creative project, paired with a critical assessment or artist's statement. These images could also be used as visuals for a more traditional assignment, like a video essay. 
    - **Multimodal Transformation:** These images can be transformed into video, and AI-generate audio (dialogue or music) can be added as well. 
        - **Critical Assessment:** Students can then examine the ultimate AI creation and discuss how visual elements can alter or enhance the perception of literary themes.
        - **Artist's Statement:** Students could also provide an artist's statement, discussing their aesthetic choices for the images and videos. 


### 3. Creative Rewriting and Fanfiction

- **AI-Generated Content:** Generate a fanfiction chapter based on Chekhov's characters using AI.
    - **Significant Rewriting:** Similar to previous examples where student heavily edit/annotate AI outpit, here, students would once again revise the AI-generated text to align with authentic character voices and plot coherence.
        - **Narrative Critique:** This annotation would be paired with a reflection on the collaborative process with AI and its implications for creativity and originality in literature.

- **Analysis of Large Textual Datasets:** Building on the previous example, students can use AI to parse large data sets of text (hundreds of thousands of words) using python notebooks and other AI tools like NotebookLM. 
    - **Survey of Fanfiction:** Students could upload a large corpus of text, like fanfiction for a given text across multiple languages, then perform analysis on the trends within this corpus. 
        - This analysis could be related to close readings of plot and characters across this huge corpus (what memes have been created within the text?) or be more psychoanalytic/ethnographic (why are are some elements held constant while others are chnaged?).

### 4. Linguistic Analysis

- **Data Parsing:** Use Python in a notebook (the most accessible version is a Google Colab) to analyze linguistic patterns such as word frequency, sentence structure, or use of literary devices in a given text.
    - **Visualization:** Create graphs or charts to represent your findings, highlighting patterns that contribute to the narrative's impact.
        - This cannot be done with AI, which has limited ability to generate data-accurat evisualizations. However, AI can assist students with performing statistical analysis (especially with R). 
    - **Interpretation:** Discuss how these patterns enhance the understanding of themes and character dynamics.

### 5. Phonetic and Metrical Exploration

- **AI-Assisted Analysis:** Use AI tools to identify interesting instances of rhythm, rhyme, and sound patterns in the original text. 
    - **Metric Structure:** Explore how the phonetic qualities and metric structure contribute to the overall impact of the passage.
    - **Comparative Study:** Contrast these findings with how such elements are preserved or altered in translation.
        - These translations or the original can then be transformed into audio via a range of AI tools (elevenlabs, OpenAI, etc.)

## Support and Resources:

Students are encouraged to reach out to the Learning Lab for consultations or for guidance on using AI tools and integrating them into their projects. Technical assistance will focus on simplifying the use of these tools to ensure that the primary focus remains on content, argumentation, and engagement with the text.
