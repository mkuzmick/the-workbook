Christine: These are the things I am excited to learn this year. I know AI will be a huge focus for many courses at the university, and I’m excited to integrate AI into my interests in coding and film editing (and even camera work in the LL studio).

Aden: Hello! My name is Aden. In my capacity as MDF this year, I want to think about the intersection of art, design and ecologies—for example, how do natural environments provide a framework for thinking about design challenges. I am also interested in what it would mean to think critically about the media and design technologies that we use in our work. What are some of the ethical and political dimensions of these tools? How can they be used in educationally-meaningful ways but also abused by powerful actors?
Generally speaking, I am excited about supporting the Bok Center in imagining new systems and methods for teaching through creative, multimedia practices.

Leo: At first day of mdf orientation - reiterated wanting to learn 1) mapping and how to make aesthetic changes in map design to tell compelling urban musical histories and 2) studying and conveying the structure of video essays and simple animations that make the essay look “lived in.” Added some wishful thinking about tech frustration :upside_down_face:

Alex: Today we had our first day of MDF Orientation and we discussed some of the things we're most excited to explore for the year in our departments. I am looking forward to learning some graphic design skills to make aesthetically pleasing posters for department events, learning some podcast pedagogy skills, and also introducing a web platform on which students in the Slavic Department's class on ballet can design ballet gifs and annotate clips of dancers. I also want to help create a communal annotation webpage for students reading Tolstoy or Nabokov together-- so that they can have more productive discussions in class. Finally, I'd love to collaborate with Kevin Holden on a "poems in motion" project. I am going to be taking a poetry workshop with Josh Bell this semester and I'd love to pitch a "video poetry" module to him.

Austin: Hello I’m Austin Tucker. I just started the first day of orientation for the media and design fellowship at the Bok Center’s Learning Lab. This year I’m most excited about learning more about principles of design. The Global Health Education and Learning Incubator regularly employs educational videos for teaching foundations of public health. I hope to cultivate my passion for watching films to motivate development of video communication. I’m also really interested in learning more about AI tools in education and how it can be used to assist and modulate students’ learning process and engagement with assignments without replacing their thinking.
