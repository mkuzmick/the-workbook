(for bonus points, reference images from your lluf-updates channel as you answer any and all of the questions below--you can post things as you go--even external links if meaningful)

- Tell us a little about a memorable project or task or activity from this term. Try to describe it in detail and then unpack it. What did you learn from it? How does it connect to the undergrad curriculum or to Higher Ed or academic research more broadly? Why does it matter to you? And how does it connect to the future? to things you might do next or that Harvard might do next?
- tell us about one specific skill or tool or concept you learned as a LLUF this term (can be really small or really big, really technical or really philosophical). What are you going to be able to do going forward because you learned this? How does it connect (or not connect) with other things you are learning at Harvard?
- what experiences did you have with generative AI this year (both as a LLUF and as a student). Where is this all headed?
- where are you off to next. What will you take with you? (literally and figuratively)
- what does it mean to be "happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way?" Can it really miserable and magical at the same time? Or does it have to be one or the other? Discuss.
