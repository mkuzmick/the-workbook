## ai this week

### Monday

- NFI
    - worked through the kinks of our AI for educators presentation. Ran out of time (as is typical for version 1!) but came away with new contacts and notes for ourselves on what to tweak for the session with ladder faculty.
- in preparation for the NFI we developed additional Custom GPTs we stored in the GPT base, including the GPT that captures Learning Lab 2 x 3.5" index cards and returns their contents as nicely structured JSON and CSV files.


### Tuesday

- NFI
    - worked to prepare Madeleine to present on Day 2 of the NFI (choreographing a little playful critique of MK's ridiculous personalization preferences and memory)
    - made more personal one-on-one connections with new faculty from Comp Lit, Slavic, and MCB who came in separately to the LL to meet.

### Wednesday

- met with the Embedded EthiCS team about various AI/ethics collaborations, foremost a plan for them to help us run one of the meetings of the upcoming Bok Seminar devoted specifically to AI and Ethics.
- hosted the Social Studies faculty meeting in order to discuss ways the Bok Center can support their work and spent some time discussing possible uses of AI for their courses.

### Thursday

- interesting data-point => we met with instructor of English 98R working on tech dystopias. She is doing an entire week on AI, but is concerned that the English Department has adopted the strongest possible anti-AI policy, so worries about encouraging the students to use AI.
- we prepped for the second Open House by building additional GPTs and bots
- we were contacted by faculty from the NFI hoping to come to the Open House and/or set up meetings with us, in particular to new people joining Comp Lit working on projects that will involve AI
    - both Matylda and Moira will be visiting us, and Moira, in particular, has impressively complex and innovative plans for integrating AI in her course.


### Friday

- MK built a translation bot to prepare for the Hebrew class coming in next week and for the Comp Lit translation workshop, but decided to start by building a custom version for Moira Weigel based on the languages she mentions in her profile on the Departmental website
    - the bot creates live transcriptions of what speakers say on camera in the LL Studio (at 8-14 isolated microphones--though we used just 2 in the demo) and sends them to Slack.
    - we then had a sequence of four separate bots send French, German, Spanish and Mandarin translations as comments on that Slack message
    - then, for fun, we had a final "Comp Lit Critic Bot" send somewhat snarky critical assessments of any unconventional choices in the translations
    - the bot is basically ready for the Hebrew class about to come in
    - also Moira and MK discussed the idea of having similar autonomous agents serve as digital "visitors" to the exhibits students will be creating in her course over the course of the term
- the second Open House was also a success. 
    - Chris Stubbs came early on and sadly not many folks showed up while he was here, but at least this meant we got to talk with him and I think he left basically happy with what we had put together.
    - more folks showed up as the session went on, and, as indicated above, the cascading translation bot gave folks loads of ideas
