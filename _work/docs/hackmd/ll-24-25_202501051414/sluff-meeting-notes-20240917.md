**AI summary:**

Josh, a junior concentrating in Computer Science and Social Studies at Harvard, plans to spend his time as a SLLUF this term by assisting with the AI Open Houses. Specifically, he wants to focus on language-course GPTs, aiming to enhance student interaction with generative AI technologies. His specialization in generative AI at the LL this past spring and his concurrent research position with a computational-linguistics postdoc this fall prepares him to apply these technologies effectively in educational settings. This project responds to the urgent need to integrate advanced AI tools into language learning, supporting the presentation of academic ideas and fostering efficient learning experiences.

In addition to his role in the Open Houses, Josh plans to engage in coding projects for the studio "machine," anticipating the development of tools that support specific courses. This involvement aligns with his academic focus and is expected to contribute to the Learning Lab's goal of creating knowledge assets that benefit the community. Through this project, Josh will gain hands-on experience with practical applications of AI, expanding his skills and potentially opening up new future opportunities in his field.
