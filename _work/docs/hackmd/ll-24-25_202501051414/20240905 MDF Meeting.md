# 20240905 MDF Meeting

## the plan
* MDFs rotate through three different stations:
    * informal/podcast style interview set up with two mics and headphones
    * formal/small studio/newscaster set up where you're speaking to camera
    * cinematic/dramatic/doc-style set up where the subject is being interviewed by someone off camera
* IF ANYONE SPEAKS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE - DO THAT as you talk :)

* for the course we're supporting, students are reflecting on why they're studying this and what are the challenges to doing that
    * We’ll interview each other about why it’s important to learn Modern Hebrew and what are the challenges that stand in the way - this is the act 1 of the movie about this, the what is at stakes, why this matters - this is what you’ll explore across the stations and you’ll interview each other about this
* make this about your discipline
    * why is your discipline important/what are the stakes of your discipline
    * what are the challenges of your discipline
    * if the one way to demonstrate knowledge in your discipline is with an academic monograph, is it reaching the broadest number of people possible?!
