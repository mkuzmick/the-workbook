# FYSEMR 65Q


AI tools will be applied broadly across this course for student use. Bok staff demonstrated a template for an “Artist’s Statement Assistant” GPT that interviews the students about their final projects for the course. The course will also be coming into the Learning Lab and use AI to generate storyboards related to the Epic of Gilgamesh.
