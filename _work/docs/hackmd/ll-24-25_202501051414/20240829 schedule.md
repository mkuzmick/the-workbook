## ideas (not using)
* for curating activity
    * take the media
        * make a hackmd about orientation
        * list out on cards the things we did (as a group)
        * on other cards - how you could imagine these concepts/ideas/tools being used in your discipline - pick 3 and unpack those
        * or choose 2 and use arts supplies to illustrate???
        * or could make a lookbook about forms??
        * or print out things that help them conceptualize their goals as an MDF for the year? / make a tablescape
        * present at overhead
        * we get the transcript - CD turns this into an orientation report for each dept.?
    * on-camera interviews
        * MDFs interview each other
        * questions you'd ask to get someone to reflect on a thing they made or did
        * these questions on cards
        * rationales on cards to help you stay on track as you speak?

## learning objectives
* learning photography
* reporting
* how it goes into the airtable
* then last chunk is curation and celebration (with the media generated)
