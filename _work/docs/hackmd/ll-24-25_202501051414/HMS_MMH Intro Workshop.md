### goals
1. introduce the learning lab
2. get students thinking about how to use different media modalities to create a story
### activites
Quick intro - then three stations - then a share out

2. audio
3. graphic design

## plan

Quick intro - then three stations - then a share out
- Interactive video station (sophie)
	- Play a clip, show them how to do something from the clip (ground in an example, and then they can try)
	- [Vox's How Taiwan held off Covid-19, until it didn't](https://youtu.be/0fhaEIlGux4)

- Interactive audio station (casey)
	- Play a clip, show them how to do something from the clip (person on the street, host recording, radiolab, etc.) - could do mic taste test, or could be about process of editing
	- [Vox's New Variant Just Dropped](https://megaphone.link/VMP9275753825)

- Social media+web station (jordan)
	- We’ve pulled down from social media campaigns from public health campaigns and similar things, and had a station where they talk through things like that
And then students can share out - is there something that really resonated?
