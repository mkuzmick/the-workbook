Media & Design Fellows provide direct support to specific courses, helping students develop and complete multimodal assignments. MDFs also host workshops in multimodal communication, multimodal storytelling, and presentation techniques. They also provide general support to their departments by developing resources and hosting events that support multimodal scholarship.

In this report, you can read about:
* The **training with the Learning Lab** Austin did to get ready to support projects in GHELI
* The **courses and projects** Austin worked on this term

## Learning Lab Training

During MDF orientation in August and throughout the bi-weekly fall MDF meetings, Austin learned:
* how to **design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources** that help students in the particular courses they are supporting.
* a set of **multimodal pedagogy and instructional design best practices** and ways of connecting it to their discipline
* **the affordances of different media** and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

To get ready to support GHELI projects, the **tools** that Austin specializes in include:
* **cameras, lights, and other filmmaking tools** that we use to illustrate cinematic principles that could be useful for students' video essay and other film projects
* **DIY filmmaking practices**, including shooting video with a smart phone
* **Final Cut Pro**, a video editing tool used for video essays and other film projects
* **AI tools**, including custom GPTs, Stable Diffusion, and other multimodal AI APIs


## Course Support

### GENED 1063: World Health: Challenges and Opportunities

In this course, students have the option to use a range of media forms to communicate with a target audience about a public health topic. Austin is working closely with the course team to provide three main types of support to this course.

#### 1. Multimedia Assignment Development with the Course Team
To support this course, Austin is **helping the course team  brainstorm and refine ideas** for student workshops, focusing on intentional media form choices and project planning. Austin's goals are to:
- **Help students develop communication skills** for their final multimedia project, ensuring their work moves beyond "raising awareness" and focuses on achieving behavioral change.
- **Assist in defining the skills expected for the project** and guide students in making informed media choices to match their target audience and communication goals.

#### 2. AI-Augmented Interactive Class Activities  
Austin is supporting efforts to integrate AI into class activities, including:  
- **Exploring AI tools** for text pattern recognition and computer vision to create interactive activities.  
- **Assisting in the development of AI-augmented in-class polling** and alternative systems for attendance and activity submissions.

#### 3. Policy Brief AI Exercises  
Austin will help develop in-class activities where students analyze AI-generated policy briefs to identify errors or improvements, exploring how AI can assist in formatting briefs without creating their content.

## GHELI Projects

### GHHP Teaching Fellows Workshop
To support the GHHP Teaching Fellows, Austin is designing **a workshop** on multimedia pedagogy tailored to global health contexts. Austin will develop asynchronous, on-demand workshops and skill builders for diverse audiences that can be accessed any time.

### Creative Communication Project  
This project focuses on harmonizing health system conceptual frameworks into a coherent visual communication output. Key objectives include:  
- Developing a GHELI workshop on identifying and leveraging key visual elements for effective communication.  
- Selecting frameworks that align with specific project purposes.
