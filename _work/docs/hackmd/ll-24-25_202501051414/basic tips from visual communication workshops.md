# basic recaps of activities from visual communication workshops


## introduction to "why" this form (in this case, posters)
* We discussed the format of academic papers and how we read them in a linear order. This contrasts with posters, where sections are arranged in space in a way that allows readers to bounce among different sections. If we are thoughtful about this spatial arrangement, we can communicate the relationship among different sections!

## unpack a model
* We unpacked a model graphic that was featured in this week's student presentation. We discussed ways in which this graphic could be edited to be more effective. Some questions we posed as important considerations when generating graphics were...
    * How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
    * How do the **alignment** and  **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
    * How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
    * What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
    * Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
    * Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?



## remix a paper

* We did an activity in which we "remixed" an academic paper from class.  We prototyped how the content from a paper might be displayed as a poster using craft supplies.

    * First, we looked at the text to find key words that might hint at how the concept could be displayed graphically (e.g., expressing the idea of "lead to" graphically might be accomplished with arrows between elements to convey flow).
    * We then prototyped graphical representations of the text using paper and other craft supplies. Several students shared their work and the reasoning behind their design choices.







## a presentation tip
* We talked about how we present posters in the same way we might give someone a tour of our home. We don't need to memorize everything we are going to say. We are familiar with everything we want to talk about and can guide our audience through our work without a script.

## quick technical tips
 * We transitioned to computers to see how different software (Canva, Illustrator, Keynote) could be used to digitally recreate the paper prototypes. We noted the ways in which Canva sometimes encourages less effective design choices and reminded ourselves to be thoughtful and intentional with each element of our design.
