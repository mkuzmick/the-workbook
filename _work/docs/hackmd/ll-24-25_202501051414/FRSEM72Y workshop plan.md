## rationale and production plan worktime (30 min)
pair share to talk about what form they are thinking about.

some work time to develop a pitch for their form
1. WHO: your name!
2. WHAT: name the form
3. WHY: develop rationale for why that form is the best to communicate your content
4. HOW: draft a production plan outlining the scope of your work and how you plan to get it done

## Trying out the "moves" of video capture (1 hour)
there are a ton, and we'd have to sudy for a entire four years of film school to really understand all of them, but let's constraint ourselves to just 3 categories of composition:

    1. shot length
    2. lighting
    3. angles
    
some demos/discussion of what the moves communicate.



### Activity: video intro challenge

1. draw cards to determine your challenges:
    - jars for each category? or maybe get llufs in the morning to creat little pouches of combos
3. quick scripting how would you do your pitch differently in these 3 scenes?)(20 minutes)
    the goal is to get your pitch down to about 20-30 seconds!!!

6. capture (30 minutes)

8. share out at main table (20 min)

## break (10 minutes)

## incorporating additional visuals: canva (1 hour)
the goal is to 
1. email video clips
2. create a video design in canva
3. download and upload videos to canva
4. add a graphic element
    - insert: graphic design basics?
6. add stock footage
7. add music
8. add a voice over
