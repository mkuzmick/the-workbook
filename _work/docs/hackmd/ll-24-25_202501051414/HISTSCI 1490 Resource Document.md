# HISTSCI 1490: Crafting Your Intervention

As you approach your final project for **"History and Culture of Stigma,"** this guide is designed to inspire and assist you in creating an impactful intervention around a stigmatized health issue. These implementations can be enacted (publishing a TikTok video, postering around the square) or purely hypothetical (a grant proposal, a movie script). Remember, your creativity is key, and thinking outside the box is encouraged.

## 1. Identifying Your Audience and Choosing the Form of Your Intervention

The foundation of any impactful intervention is a deep understanding of your intended audience. Before deciding on the form your project will take, invest time in reflecting on *who* you want to reach and *why*. **Your deep understanding of the audience should inform every aspect of your intervention.**

Choose a medium and content that align with preferences and needs of your audience, as this will shape how you communicate your message. Tailor visual and auditory elements to appeal to them, focusing on design and aesthetics (like color schemes and imagery). Think about engagement strategies to actively involve your audience, such as interactive elements or calls to action. Define what success looks like by establishing clear, measurable objectives and consider how you would evaluate effectiveness through surveys, engagement metrics, or feedbackâ€”even if only hypothetically.


## 2. Exploring Diverse Forms of Intervention

To spark your creativity, here is a list of various forms your intervention could take. This list is not exhaustive, but demonstrative: 

### **Audio/Visual Interventions**

* **Video Essays**
  * Useful if your interpretive claim would benefit from visualizations that relate to speech (i.e., as you speak or offer your analysis orally).
* **Podcasts**
  * Transform an argument into an oral form and can address a broad audience, especially with an informal, conversational style
* **Public Service Announcements (PSAs)**
  * Short videos or audio clips broadcasted to raise awareness.
* **Documentary Films**
  * Provide an in-depth exploration of stories and issues through film.
* **TikTok Series or Social Media Videos**
  * Creating a series of short videos to engage audiences on platforms like TikTok.
    * *Example:* A past student in this course created a TikTok series about domestic violence that received thousands of views.
* **Theater Performances**
  * Plays or skits that depict experiences and challenges.
* **Virtual Reality Experiences**
  * Offer immersive simulations that allow users to experience different perspectives.

### **Web-Based Interventions**

* **Interactive Websites**
  * Online platforms offering resources, stories, and interactive elements to engage users.
* **Mobile Applications**
  * Apps designed to educate, support, or connect users.
* **Infographics**
  * Visual representations of data and information.
* **Timelines**
  * Can be used to chart change over time and highlight significant moments.
* **[StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)**
  * Enable you to spatially plot significant narrative details.
* **Training Modules**
  * Developing educational content or modules for platforms like Canvas to train faculty or staff.
* **Memes or GIFs**
  * Generating bite-sized cultural content through virtual allusions, often with humor.


### **Visual and Spatial Storytelling**

* **Photo Essays**
  * Allow you to develop a claim through juxtaposition, similarity, and storytelling with a series of photographs.
* **Art Installations**
  * Visual or interactive art pieces that provoke thought and dialogue.
* **Product Design Prototypes**
  * Designing products that address the stigmatized issue.
    * *Example:* A past student designed wheelchairs based on famous chairs in the history of design, showcased in an exhibit.
* **Virtual Galleries**
  * Involve compiling various pieces of content (e.g., objects and text) into a cohesive, larger claim.
      * this could be web-based or built in a 3D environment like Unreal or Unity.
* **Museum Exhibits**
  * Curated displays that educate and engage visitors on the topic.
* **Community Art Projects**
  * Collaborative art initiatives like quilts or murals.
    * *Example:* The AIDS Memorial Quilt displayed in Washington, D.C.

### **Community Engagement and Events**
