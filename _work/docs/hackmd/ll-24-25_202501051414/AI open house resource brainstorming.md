            * how are we defining "it"?

* chatGPT EDU interface guide
* prompt "engineering"
    * GPT instructions, custom chatGPT, in-chat
* knowledge base 
    * how does it work?
    * document upload/preparation 
    * code interpreter 
* actions
    * this may be too adavnced/granular?
* contacts/resources
    * a quick list of contacts/emails/entities that can assist professors in the coming year, with tags of how they can help and with what

* faculty-facing use-cases: 
    * GPT w/ an Action (hack.md example?) 
    * GPT that produces structured output (code, etc.)
    * GPT w/ [data analysis](https://openai.com/index/improvements-to-data-analysis-in-chatgpt/)

MK NOTES:

- creating acct and logging in
- overview of interface
    - screen shot can show sidebar with mouse over sidebar toggle button (circled)
    - explain three key areas
        - left sidebar
        - main window
        - dropdown options under logo
- the main window is where you'll chat
    - simple starter (screenshot)
- as for settings (screenshot)
    - we won't go through all of them, but you should note the ability to write some custom information about yourself and your preferences (sample = bio, default response style or coding language, etc) (screenshot)
- in the sidebar you'll see the history of your chats and GPTs (screenshot with new chat button clicked and circled)
    - we'll get to GPTs in a sec, but let's create a new chat
    - you'll note it comes up with a title for the chat that will help you find your way back to it if you want to pick up the thread later, but you can also 
    - rename it 
    - delete it
    - or get a share link that can be shared with members of the Harvard workspace
        - note: if you ever want to undo a share, you can find that in settings (screenshot)
- if you want to create a temporary chat, click this [screenshot]
- finally, in the upper portion of the sidebar you will find links to Custom GPTs, which are instances of ChatGPT that have been modified with custom instructions, tools, and documents. We have a separate resource on creating your own Custom GPTs in this doc (LINK). But you can already access Custom GPTs others at Harvard have created and published by clicking this and seeing this (screenshot)
