## How Much and When Do I Work?
- The SLLUF position typically averages 10 hours per week, with exceptions for those wanting to work more or less overall. Know that 10 hours is an average. Some weeks your projects will demand a larger chunk of your time; other weeks you might have other commitments and spend less time on LL work.

- With the exception of the Specialized LLUF meeting, your exact schedule is up to you. Just be sure to spend at least 50% of your time in person at the LL, and keep your schedule up to date in the SLLUF Schedule calendar. Many fellows find that setting a recurring weekly schedule works well, and that tends to work really well for us on the Staff side too, since we get a sense of when we get to see you!

- You can also check out the LL calendars to find out what’s happening at the LL each week as you make your schedule.

## Time Reporting
- Submit your hours weekly to Peoplesoft by Thursday at 5pm. If you miss the initial deadline, submit as soon as you can up until Sunday. If it’s Monday or later, please send a message in your individual channel to get help from the Bok admin team.

---

## Weekly Check-ins
- Each week you will have a flexible check-in with JK:
  - Connect to the relevant resources and mentors for your projects.
  - Keep working towards your larger personal goals and align them with the broader LL mission.
  - Do some creative storytelling around your portfolio of projects.
  - Some weeks these will be in person, some recorded, and sometimes it will just be checking in on slack if our in person availabilty doesn't align.

## The SLLUF Meetings
- While much of your time will be spent working on a specific project involving your medium of expertise, the magic of the Learning Lab is at the intersection of our different expertises and projects. So we want you to attend a bi-weekly gathering of the SLLUFs, LL staff, and sometimes special guests, to engage with each other’s projects.

### The LLUF Meetings
- You are welcome to join in on these if you would like to!!
- Every Friday from 1:30-2:45 the LLUFs meet to learn new skills across the array of tools and forms we work in at the LL. Some weeks we will have quick tutorials to get you started in some tool, other weeks we will have a designLab to get everyone thinking and working on a single challenge. Some weeks, we may even have taskmaster or project runway style challenges for you to prove your chops and engage in an activity we are testing out. 
- overall its a great time to come together and do classic LL activities!

## Sharing and Saving Work
Share your work as often as possible. Keeping a log of your process helps project mentors and future fellows understand the steps you took. It also helps us tell the story of your work as a Specialized LLUF!

1. You are required to post an update in your individual updates channel every time you work on your project, whether in person or remotely.
2. You will share larger progress updates and reports at milestones determined with your staff mentor during your project launch.
3. You will share your work at our end of term showcase!



Beyond that, you can save your materials in a few different zones depending on the form you are working in. JK and your mentor(s) can help you determine the best option during the project launch. Some options include Google Drive folders, project Slack channels, and the LL Synology. In addition to digital materials, we create a lot of valuable physical stuff at the LL — cards and paper from a brainstorming session, sketches, visuals from a presentation, etc. We want to save all these things! As the semester goes on, we’ll develop a system for storing and labeling this stuff.

## Projects
Often we might be supporting a stack of projects that’s a match for your skills, discipline, and interests. 

### Some Project Examples:
- Develop multimodal educational deliverables including assets, resources, student guides, and additional documentation (with assistance and guidance from senior staff mentors).
- Co-design and lead workshop activity stations. Meet with LL staff leading the workshop, develop ideas and a plan, create handouts or resources, and practice with LLUFs. Help prepare materials and space, run the station, and write a report or an on-screen story for the station.
- Research and manage our inventory of emerging tools and resources. Beta-test a new tool or update, and write reviews or reports on it for various audiences.
- Augment the aesthetic and functional capacities of our studio.

---

### Project Launch
- A recorded conversation with your project mentor(s).
- We will collect and structure the information for you and provide you with a Project Charter document to launch your project.
- You will be responsible for suggesting edits to this document and committing to its specifications.

---

### Progress Updates
- Every time you work, post a brief update in your `#ll-slluf-name-i-updates` channel.
- At the milestones and deadlines outlined in your Project Charter, submit the specified reports.
- Show and tell your work with the SLLUF cohort at the bi-weekly SLLUF meetings.

---

### Project Report
- When your project wraps, submit a final project summary in the form specified in your Project Charter.
- A presentation or exhibit at our end of term and end of year showcases!
