## Prototyping

When starting a project it's always good to prototype your ideas before jumping straight into digital. You may find that you like the paper over the digital version! Or you may find a way to combine the two. Prototyping can also help you decide what application and software will be best suited for your needs. 

I wanted to make cubes to make a 3d letter L. I decided to do that by making origami cubes before making it using the 3d modeling software, blender. 

## Time and Materials

One thing to take into account when building anything is the amount of time that process will take. Everyone is different so some processes might be faster for some than others. 

What materials you have access to can also effect your process. Some people may not have a fast computer but they might have colorful paper handy. 

Something to also take into account is how familiar you are with the application you hope to use. Are you an expert or a beginner? Are there tutorials online for what you're trying to do? Even when following a tutorial you have to consider the amount of time you will have to pause the video to follow along. A 30 minute tutorial can easily turn into an hour long project. 

Above shows that it took about 45 minutes to make all those cubes to shape an L whereas blender took me 11 minutes. I have used blender a lot. Some people not as familiar with blender may take longer than 11 minutes. Although the origami took longer it is also turned out nicer looking than the blender render.

Overall, paper prototyping can be useful when planning out projects and considering what applications and tools you should use for a project.
