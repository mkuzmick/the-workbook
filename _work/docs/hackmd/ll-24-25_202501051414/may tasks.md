* NAHSP june 7, 14, 20 (how many tables do we need for this? how many students? ask cd)





get everything out of the spaces we want clean and identify storage potential they have and then make a thoughtful decision about what goes there. also what surfaces are available for displaying student work and is it appropriate to put things there
* fireplace room
    * for worktime and meeting: paper cards and markers. games move to studio or classroom
* storage 1
    * jk/cd determine what
        * should be on display because it's used frequently
        * what's never used (throw away or put away in a less accessible bin)
        * what's not being stored well (subdividers for bins (like bags) or doesn't need the level of specifity that is currently there)
