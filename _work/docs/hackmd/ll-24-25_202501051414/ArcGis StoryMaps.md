# How to make the most of StoryMaps
## 1. Use StoryMaps as the icing on the cake
* Edits to images, videos, audio clips etc. should be done prior to importing them to StoryMaps as StoryMaps has limited tools for editing media once it has been imported. StoryMaps works best as a tool to consolidate and strucutre information.

## 2. Diversity is the spice of StoryMaps - vary the features you use
* As mentioned above, there are various types of maps you can use that **emphasize different points**. For example:
    * If the geographical aspect is more important, a **map-focused** feature could look like this:

    * If the image/video/audio is more important, a **media-focused** feature could look like this:

## 3. A rose by any other name - tell the same story in a different way
* There are many ways to show the same thing but to different effect! For instace, if you want to explore an audio clip, there are a few ways you could do it.
    * Add a link to a video with the audio clip
    ![a](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkF6Vcreye.jpg)
    * Import the audio clip alone with some accompanying text
    ![c](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMEScSxke.jpg)
    * Embed the audio clip in a scrolling list that accompanies a map
    ![d](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk_VrcSgyx.jpg)
