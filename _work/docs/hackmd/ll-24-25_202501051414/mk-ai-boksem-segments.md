# mk-ai-boksem-segments


## syll

- not an ML class
- a prototyping and testing class with the simplest tech stack we can put together for you
- we are here to support you and codesign with you, just as we do for Harvard's Faculty each year.


## day 1


- what is the Learning Lab?
    - prototyping and testing
    - we are going to give you this experience
- we learn by building, particularly when we're in a new space where there aren't well worked out rules and stable stores of agreed-upon knowledge
- we will not be training our own models or investigating the finer details of machine learning--these are beyond the Bok Center's expertise
    - the sweet spot for us lies at the intersection of academic/teaching expertise and technical skill, but we're only going to take one additional step beyond the standard starting point with each
        - for teaching and learning, we are going to not just perform the moves we know to work, or that we were trained to perform, we're going to take one step back to ask what exactly these moves do, where they fit in the teaching and learning system, and then ask questions about how that system may shift
        - for tech, we're going to look to the Customization options within the ChatGPT Edu framework and then to the APIs created by the major tech firms, and those interested can play around with these in sandboxes and Python notebooks
- let's get on ChatGPT
- 


for Next Time

- an initial Custom GPT with prompting basics



for Later in October

- then a larger project as individual or group to be demoed live in the LL Studio during one of the final 3 days of class.
