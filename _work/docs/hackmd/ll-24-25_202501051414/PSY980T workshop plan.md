# PSY980T workshop plan

**enrollment**: 16
**accomodations**: none

**length**: 1 hour (the class is in from 9:45-11:45, and we will do the workshop for the last hour.)

**people**: jk + austin + alex + amelie

## the plan
### intro & visual communication moves (5 min)
- super quick intros to the LL and to what we are doing together today
- for this assignment you have a choice to communicate your academic ideas through different forms: the brochure, the infographic, the zine, the social media post. 
- from academic moves of writing to move of visual communication. aesthetic=functional
- to choose the most effective form, think about both the content and the audience-what will best support what you are trying to communicate, and what form will your audience best connect to?


### sourcing and analyzing models (25 min)
- once we decide on the most effective form, it can be incredibly helpful to find really successful models of the form out there in the world. Doing a close reading of one(or more) of these models can help us know what works and what doesn't, and give us some structure as we venture on to create our own!
- discuss one model with the group (4 min).
    - Amelie posted some in #sourcing-media
    - what do you notice? what is being communicated? where does your eye go first?
#### graphic design basics 
- card trick? (4 min)
- then look at the model again (or a new model if they already said a ton about the first one) (4 min)

#### activity: source and analyze models 
-  1 song to find a model, (3 min)
- find a friend and talk about your models. why this model? what do you like/not like about it as a form? what are some graphic design choices that are either working for or against the content that's being communicated? (5 min)
- ask for volunteers to share theirs or their friend's model with the group. (5 min)

### canva prototype (15 min)
- in pairs, make a prototype of your piece of visual communciation.
- intro to the interface 

### share out (10 min)
- at main table, ask for volunteers to share thier prototypes and explain their graphic design choices.

- it can also be very helpful to pitch your idea to one of your peers to see what questions they might have or what feedback they can give you and how that might inform your process going forward. Talk to your peers about your models. Why this model? what do you like/not like about it as a form? What are some graphic design choices that are either working for or against the content that's being communicated? 
You can also find some examples of models in #sourcing-media
    - Questions to consider while looking at examples: What do you notice? What is being communicated? Where does your   
      eye go first?
