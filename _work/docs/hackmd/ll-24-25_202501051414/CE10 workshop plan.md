# CE10 workshop plan 

9:00-11:45 (2.5 hours, with 15 min break?)

goal: learn how to persuasively communicate your ideas to build the requisite human capital and funding relationships to launch a venture

3-Minute Film that effectively communicates your
venture idea and its social impact benefits.


Why This, Why Now, Why Us?

## intro (10-15 minutes)


## Trying out the "moves" of video capture (1 hour 40 min)
we are going to focus only on the visual choices you have to make. there are a ton, and we'd have to sudy for a entire four years of film school to really understand all of them, but let's constraint ourselve to just 3 categories:

    1. shot length
    2. movement
    3. angles
    

### Activity: the 3 shot story.

1. choose a random object. (3 min)
2. create a 30-40 second MINI story of someone interacting with your object to communicate. We somtimes practice a typical 3-shot story of:
     1. establishing shot, 
     2. medium or close up of the action, 
     3. medium or close up of the "interiority" of the person doing the action.
4. the twist: you decide: is it creating a problem? or solving one? adjust your aesthetic choices to best communicate the new story twist

5. storyboard (20 minutes)
for this challenge 


6. capture (20 minutes)

7. create your "moving" storyboard: (20 minutes)
     - blue cards = shot length choice & rationale
     - orange cards = movement choice & rationale
     - pink cards = angle choice & rationale

8. share out at main table (20 min)

## break (10 minutes)

## incorporating additional visuals: canva (1 hour)
1. email video clips
2. create a video design in canva
3. download and upload videos to canva
4. add a graphic element
    - insert: graphic design basics?
6. add stock footage
7. add music
8. add a voice over


## a bit about audio:
- filming date coming come. If you want make it easier on yourself when editing, you may want to use audio from your filming day. so any spaeking to camera in small studio and any voice over will sound the same if it's captured in the same conditions.
- alternatievly, you could make the intentional choice to have "field" audio which would be a lower quality--but you can use this to augment your story potentially.

## reveal of montage? (last 10 min)
