## walkthrough (3-4pm)

![overhead view of a table with colorful cards that were used in the planning of the stations and tools for this event](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F07RBKMCU03/img_0212.jpg?pub_secret=91faf24196)

* Main Room 
    * following the rhetorical flow of the rainbow: 
* HUIT/ATG Room 
    * assistance requesting an account/getting logged on 
* Advanced Room?
    * ideas for forking below


#### "red"

**Focus:** Introduction to generative AI tools; exploring capabilities and limitations.

**Activities:**

This is a forking moment. Those IN THE FAS (need to make that clear) who still do not have an account or need assistance are invited to join the HUIT/ATG breakout room. 

- **Experimentation:**
  - Participants test ChatGPT Edu with prompts related to their expertise.
  - Evaluate AI responses for factual accuracy and ethical considerations.
- **Critical Reflection:**
  - Discuss what the AI gets right and wrong.
  - Explore potential biases in AI-generated outputs.

**Discussion Points (dropped via the chat):**

- Ethical implications and responsibility when using AI tools.
    - posting articles + context/guiding questions into the chat to supplement

---

#### "orange" 

**Focus:** Understanding AI as a tool for discrete tasks rather than full replacements.

**Activities:**

- **Analogy Discussion:**
  - Compare "Rosey" the robot maid vs. a "Roomba" vacuum to illustrate AI's strengths.
- **Custom Prompt-Based Tools:**
  - Introduce the concept of designing Custom GPTs for specific educational tasks.
  - Discuss the creation and application of Custom GPTs in teaching.

**Discussion Points:**

- How AI can enhance teaching and learning when used appropriately?
- The potential and limitations of AI agents in education.

---

#### "yellow" 

**Focus:** Advanced methodologies like chain-of-thought reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

**Activities:**

- **Tool Comparison:**
  - Compare ChatGPT with NotebookLM to demonstrate differences in output reliability.
- **Under the Hood:**
  - Explore how AI models process information and generate responses.
      - EMR notebook demo
- **Cautious Use of AI:**
  - Discuss scenarios where traditional methods may be more effective than AI.

**Discussion Points:**

- Understanding advanced AI techniques to improve interaction quality.
- Recognizing and mitigating AI hallucinations.

## ***potential stopping point-- perhaps this is where the "advanced" fork takes place-- mk continues to demo in the main room, while people who are not as advanced move off into the Q&A portion earlier***

#### "green"

**Focus:** Hands-on experience with advanced APIs and developer tools.

**Activities:**

- **Demonstration:**
  - Show how to use Python notebooks to access APIs from OpenAI, Replicate, Google, and Anthropic.
- **Experimentation:**
  - Encourage participants to explore developer tools for greater flexibility and control.

**Discussion Points:**

- Benefits of using developer tools over consumer-facing AI products.
- Opportunities for customization and innovation in AI applications.

---

#### "blue"

**Focus:** Exploring AI applications using audio inputs and agent-based tasks.

**Activities:**


- **Creative Applications:**
  - Demonstrate translation and conversion of transcribed speech into visual content via slackbots (maybe live, if we have the whole studio set up?)
      - Showcase how Slackbots can perform tasks based on input, such as generating news reports or counterarguments.

**Discussion Points:**

- The potential of multimodal inputs to enhance AI interactions.
- Practical uses of AI agents in educational contexts.

---

## ***another potential stopping point-- unless marlon wants to demo this live/past processing of what we did at the open house***

#### "violet"

**Focus:** AI in the physical space/classroom

**Activities:**

- **Hands-On Exercise:**
  - Participants write or draw on index cards and send images into the chat?
  - marlon picks one and uses a custom GPT interface to convert this content into structured data.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Discuss how these methods can be integrated into the classroom in the future

---

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**

- **Recap:**
  - Summarize key insights from each "color" segment
- **Resources:**
  - Provide a list of articles and tools discussed for further exploration.

## Q&A (4-5pm)

* do we want to have breakout rooms by issue or level (mirroring some of the breakout rooms from the start), by domain (STEM, humanities, etc.), or by topic/issue? 
    * guiding questions for each 
    * we could also have the S/LLUFs there for student perspectives
