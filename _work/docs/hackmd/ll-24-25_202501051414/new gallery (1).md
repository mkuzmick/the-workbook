Hello! My name is Aden. In my capacity as MDF this year, I want to think about the intersection of art, design and ecologies—for example, how do natural environments provide a framework for thinking about design challenges. I am also interested in what it would mean to think critically about the media and design technologies that we use in our work. What are some of the ethical and political dimensions of these tools? How can they be used in educationally-meaningful ways but also abused by powerful actors? 

Generally speaking, I am excited about supporting the Bok Center in imagining new systems and methods for teaching through creative, multimedia practices.
