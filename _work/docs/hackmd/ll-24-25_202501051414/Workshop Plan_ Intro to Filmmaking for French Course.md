# Workshop Plan: Intro to Filmmaking for French Course
## Date: August 13, 2024

### Overview
This workshop introduces intermediate French students to key concepts in filmmaking, focusing on scene composition—framing, lighting, focus, and basic editing.

### Station Outline

#### Station 1: Framing
**Prompt:** 
"Using the *'BANDE DE FILLES'* trailer as inspiration, choose a subject and experiment with different framing techniques (close-up, medium, wide shots). Reflect on how framing changes the scene’s story and emotional impact."

#### Station 2: Lighting
**Prompt:** 
"Set up a scene with a strong light source. Experiment with positioning the light in front, behind, and to the side of your subject. How does each setup change the mood and atmosphere?"

#### Station 3: Focus and Depth of Field
**Prompt:** 
"Use manual focus to shift between foreground and background. Capture how changing focus alters the viewer’s perception of the scene."

### Opening Script

"Welcome, everyone! Today, we’re exploring the art of filmmaking by focusing on scene composition—framing, lighting, and focus. These are the building blocks of visual storytelling. For example, how you light a scene can make it feel eerie or peaceful, while your framing choices can make a character seem powerful or isolated. And by controlling focus, you can direct your audience’s attention to the most important parts of your scene.

We’re breaking these elements down into separate stations. This method lets you deeply explore each aspect and understand how each choice affects your story. When we bring these elements together later, you’ll see how they work in unison to create powerful visual narratives.

Let’s start by diving into these stations. As you move through each one, think about how you can use these techniques to express your ideas in a film. Ready? Let’s get started!"
