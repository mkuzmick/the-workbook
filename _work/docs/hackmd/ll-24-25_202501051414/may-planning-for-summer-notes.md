Jk:
* After effects animations (fusion?) 
* Web based stuff so it can be interactive
* Connecting to live events and grid controller (patatap?)
* Intros/welcome to LL
* Humanities
    * Much better version of the exploded view that explains what tia did with generative fill to give us a paper version of the miyazaki film
    * Jordan making a new one based on what tia did or on Godzilla station
    * Casey unpacking what he did already
* Package/wrapper: Title sequence (that’s more like a catalogue of the animation moves)

Things we need that we could press play on
Things we would use as samples/examples in courses


Singles for now—
-    Bio cards
-    Scale model stuff/paper dolls (studio)
-    Python data vis 
-    Exploded views

Capstone sequence that could be a video or scrolling webpage or hackMD of the stuff you did in the summer (showing off things you can do as a visual or multimodal communicator in academic work) things looking forward to things students might do in HH visual essays student work etc.
