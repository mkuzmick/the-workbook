## Generative AI for Educators Demo
This project involves creating a hands-on demonstration of generative AI tools aimed at faculty clients, introducing them to the functionalities and potential uses of generative AI in their curriculum. Students will build and teach interactive demonstrations, based on ongoing LL AI offerings. These presentations can be demonstrated to our MDFs, so students can practice teaching in a low-stakes environment with graduate-level fellows experienced in multimedia pedagogy. Studentsâ€™ final capstone may take the form of a studio installation, online gallery, or workshop.

## AI-Assisted Chatbots
Through this project, students will develop and refine AI-driven chatbots designed to support FAS courses. Forms range from custom OpenAI GPTs to assistants deployed across Jupyter Notebooks and Slack Channels. Given the dynamic landscape of emerging AI tools, this project will be geared toward exploring and experimenting with a range of AI tools and developing documentation that can guide others through a similar exploration. Students will contribute by testing chatbot functionalities, providing feedback for improvements, and developing user guides for effective implementation.
