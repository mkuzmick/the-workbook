# big-summer-projects-24
The work of the LL summer will mainly be in 3 zones: the LL System, Singles/Resources, and AI Support.

## LL System Enhancement Project
The project is about leveling up the LL over the course of the next 2-3 months. This will involve the following: 
-   cleaning and organizing in the physical space
-   deciding on the slack and airtable workflows for the coming year and testing them out
-   building any bots and scripts we want to use next year
-   create documentation (including stories and reports) on the LL that will help us next year
-   building assets we'll want to use for workshops and projects next year
-   learning things we each want to learn that will help us next year

For the physical space, this will mainly involve helping out on days you decide to work in person--just tasks-for-the-day rather than really long term things you'll need to keep thinking about.

**slack channel**: 
* `#ll-project-summer-24`
### components
* [slack-workflow-plan-20240529](/71d9O6baRC25FjU7QfgN5g)
* project tracking/updating
* reporting bots
* work bots
* more studio recording set ups for reporting
* unreal virtual production

### deadline/goals
By August 12, we want these main things in place:
* pinterest plan
* new tables built
    * model (mk)
    * cut (mk)
    * assemble (tbd)
* organization system in place
* chalk board wall
    * erase according to instructions
    * testing circles of different sizes
* setting up small studio
    * testing out a couple of backgrounds (mw+jk) to come up with some different looks in the background with the velvet and fabric (on the backside)
    * we want to put different types of black canvas on the front. can we get a drapey black canvas look (with loads of drapeyness)
    * green will go in the very front (most likely flat side of the neon spandex)
* cabling
* build another tv stand
    * model (mk)
* front desk if there's time
    * erase parts of the board
    * think about if, and where, we want a TV

## Singles/Resources
In this context, a single is a single move that, when put together with other moves, can be the building blocks of the kinds of multimodal projects that we support.

We need examples of these things for eventual resources for HAA175P; and they should also be great ways for everyone to spend time learning this summer, with concrete deliverables that we can actually use at the end!

## AI Support
The Bok Center will be helping develop strategies—in collaboration with HUIT—to integrate generative AI into a handful of introductory courses for the coming academic year. This likely will take different forms, including variations on tutorbots that provide support on problem solving, writing, multimodal communication, and perhaps even project management.

This is a larger project, one that involves many different collaborators and stakeholders. The Learning Lab specifically will be prototyping AI strategies that can benefit the selected handful of courses that end up being identified. In the meantime, the Learning Lab needs to figure out some clear requests that we can start reporting on, to help us get ready for when these courses are identified.

* part of this is thinking about how we want to present project updates this summer on these projects

## Some ideas for organizing MW’s & MK’s time for before we hear what the 5 courses are:
- A separate project channel (apart from `#project-summer-24-ai-support` for the work we’re doing on our internal systems with AI - that can feed into daily/weekly project reports, that can be shared with CS in the interim before courses are identified (and also maybe with the admin team/interested bok staff eventually)
- brainstorming features for bots from TB's list of proposed classes
- perusing the harvard course catalogue for courses we might want to propose
