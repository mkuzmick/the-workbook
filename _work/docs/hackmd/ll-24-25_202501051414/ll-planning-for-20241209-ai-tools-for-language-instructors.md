# ll-planning-for-20241209-ai-tools-for-language-instructors

## description

This workshop explores practical applications of AI in foreign language teaching, including tools for creating tiered readings, facilitating oral assessments, and enhancing engagement with constrained vocabularies. Led by Learning Lab experts and featuring insights from leading researchers, the session provides a hands-on introduction to AI tools, ranging from low-code solutions to advanced approaches. Participants examine ways to integrate AI thoughtfully into their teaching, fostering curiosity, experimentation, and effective pedagogy. The event includes opportunities for discussion, collaboration, and Q&A, with a focus on supporting instructors of less commonly taught languages.

## agenda

**3:00: Welcome!**
Today we will be experimenting with AI tools for language instruction and will be encouraging your active participation and feedback!

**3:20: Getting started with ChatGPT Edu**
This year all of Harvard's instructors and students have access to ChatGPT Edu, which means that you can depend on being able to use this for your teaching if you can design appropriate uses. We will be introducing the tool for those who haven't used it yet, then showing you some of the more advanced things you can do with it, including creating "Custom GPTs".

**4:00: Multimodal Stations**
While many interactions with AI tools are text-to-text interactions, we can also do things with images and audio. In this segment of the workshop we will have you experiment in the language of your choice with images and speech.

**4:40: Debrief and Next Steps**
In the last segment we'll piece together some of the insights we've arrived at over the course of our experiments (using AI to help us here as well). And we'll brainstorm some ways we can continue supporting language instructors in the year to come!


## plan

- intro/icebreaker
- GPT Edu basics and Custom GPTs
    - who am i? test on a simple skill and more advanced one
- multimodal stations!
    - annotate your translated mission statement
    - speak with elevenLabs and GPT advanced voice mode
    - on camera performance and transcription
- tour of tools
    - rotation through stations? or all together?
    - text to text/knowledge:
        - who am i
        - some simple skill from your course
        - some more complex and subtle skill from your course
        - 
    - voice: 
        - transcription to slackbots
        - realtime API in playground
        - chatGPT voice mode
        - elevenLabs
        - other?
    - images:
        - handwritten notes in your language
    - data:
        - show with the google form?
- activity
    - on the tour of tools get them to test an array of things and fill out form or report back
    - 
- presentations/debrief
    - process the forms as in cl207
    - next steps

## prep

- tidy studio
- rainbow of computers
- find the asl videos (why I sign but also the course head in small studio) on synology or g drive, grab intermittent stills and see how o4 does
- potentially (if LLUFs) a little prep work in each language (like print the handout in each?)
- print up some papers
- [ai-articles](/6vl6o3QyTQ-no0SgRL5VHg)
