# GENED1145 Workshop Report


NOTE! THIS IS A DRAFT!


## Overview
In this workshop, we worked on **leveling up your video essay skills**. Since you’ve already completed one video essay, this workshop was about improving those skills in ways that felt appropriate for your current level. We provided three distinct zones, each with a different focus, to help you elevate your work.

## Why Video Essays?
We emphasized that the video essay format is particularly well-suited for this course, where you're analyzing films. Often, when students have some choice over what format to use, we encourage them to choose something that aligns with the material they’re studying. This class already had that alignment: you’re working in a format (the video essay) that perfectly matches your subject matter (film). This gave you a great starting point, and the workshop was designed to help you build on that strength.

## Workshop Breakdown

### Station 1: Paper Prototyping
At the **paper prototyping zone**, the goal was to think about the types of arguments you’d make in your video essay—quickly and without resistance.

- **What You Did:**
  - You pulled still images from the films you’re analyzing (with more available if needed) and combined them with the theoretical and technical frameworks you’ve been working with in class.
  - You had access to a book of film terms that helped you get more specific about what’s happening in the films (e.g., mise-en-scène, framing, lighting).
  - You also integrated perspectives from theoretical articles, which gave historical, political, and even Marxist and feminist frameworks.
  
- **Why It Mattered:**
  This station was about speed—getting your ideas down on paper without the friction that comes with digital tools. You used this time to rough out ideas as quickly as possible under the overhead camera, setting a strong foundation for later stages.

### Station 2: Digital Tools
After you prototyped on paper, you moved to the **digital tools station**, where you worked on translating your ideas into digital form.

- **What You Did:**
  - You experimented with a range of tools, from simpler ones like **Canva**, to more advanced programs like **Adobe Premiere, After Effects**, and **Final Cut**.
  
- **Key Point:**
  - We emphasized that you can get a lot done with easy-to-use tools, and you don’t always need complex software to achieve your goals. The ideas you sketched in the paper prototyping zone can be just as effectively realized with the simpler digital tools.

### Station 3: Learning by Doing
The final station was about **learning by doing**. Here, you got hands-on experience with the techniques discussed in class.

- **What You Did:**
  - You learned about concepts like **racking focus**, **shot length**, and **three-point lighting**, and you had the chance to experiment with setting up your own shots.
  - You applied some of the techniques covered in the **Bordwell and Thompson** book, not just by studying them, but by doing them yourself.
  
- **Why It Mattered:**
  This station helped you think more like a filmmaker rather than just a viewer. By constructing your own shots, you deepened your understanding of the production techniques that create meaning in film.

## Fun Integration: AI-Powered Transcription and Analysis
For a bit of extra fun, we also introduced a playful **AI transcription element** during the workshop.

- **How It Worked:**
  - If you narrated your video essay or film at one of the microphones, we used OpenAI to transcribe your speech. It was then translated into Japanese, and we created an imaginary analysis from the perspective of a Japanese film historian.
  - This transcription and translation happened in the background, and you could see the result via a **Slack bot**.

- **Why We Did This:**
  This was a lighthearted way to show how different perspectives might interpret your work, adding an element of creativity and imagination to the process.

## Next Steps
After moving through all three stations, you should have a better sense of how to take your video essay to the next level:

1. **Start with a paper prototype** to quickly organize your ideas.
2. **Move to digital tools** to bring those ideas to life.
3. **Learn by doing** by applying film techniques firsthand to sharpen your production skills.

We hope this workshop gave you valuable insights and the confidence to approach your next video essay with more creativity and technical skill. If you have any questions or need further support, feel free to reach out during office hours or use the resources we’ve provided.
