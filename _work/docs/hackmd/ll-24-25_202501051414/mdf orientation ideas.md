# first-year mdf orientation ideas
* [last year's schedule](https://hackmd.io/G7RirblCRz-uqiWlb5SiSA?view) for reference

## tues. 08/20: session 1
* **key ideas for this day**: 
    * backward design as an approach to take when designing assignments (and the importance of this in the multimodal assignment zone)
    * what do we want students to be able to do in our disciplines and in what ways is academic writing getting students there and NOT getting students there? 
* intro to LL + key Bok staff
* defining the dominant modes of communication in their fields
    * mapping out what this does
    * having rationles for them (or anti-rationales - rationales against them as worthy dominant modes!)
    * taking apart this machine
    * connecting to Bloom's taxonomy, etc. - our goals for students/what we want them to be able to do
    * rationales via Meyer
    * when does academic writing enable this
* what is multimodal communication? and how might it help us reach the goals we have for students?
    * maybe connect this to generative learning (and ask TB if she'd want to help out again?)
    * identifying key 'moves' of different media
        * have them articulate what these moves do
        * why they're significant
    * visual comm as intro (and gets them thinking about workshop mechanics like visualizing ideas)
* systems + onboarding
    * do this right before lunch instead of first thing?
    * have them use slack earlier but show them some key channels and any cals here

## thurs. 08/22: session 2
* **key ideas for this day**: 
    * what could come next/what's after academic writing?
    * a survey of some forms and tools 
    * rationalizing the forms and tools we choose for students
* "forward" design
    * backward design wants us to identify the LOs, then determine what demonstrating proficiency would look like, THEN choosing what we'll do
    * rationales via fiorella + Mayer/generative learning
    * looking to a range of media forms and thinking about what they can do that academic writing can't
    * then thinking about why you'd have students work in/with those forms
* serial and video essay
    * highlight this as key workshop opening
    * finding a model and unpacking it
* they find a media form and unpack it
    * then create a bite-sized activity that would help students learn what this form can do
* key for this day is helping them think about learning experiences for students, maybe even more so(???) than designing alternative assignments - thinking about things they could implement now (i.e., workshops)
* some kind of AI-augmented lookbook activity
    * captures what they say as they unpack their form
    * capture several stills of that and the form itself
    * and then captions to make it into a multimedia lookbook

## tues. 08/27: session 3
* **key ideas for this day**: 
    * we've thought about the future of academic comms
    * and how we might help students deepen their understanding by working with/in diff media
    * what they can do with media that they can't with academic writing alone
    * today is about learning how to use the tools of the LL studio to get at those learning objectives we defined in week 1
    * how can we use the equipment of the LL to address goals we have for students (even if they are still going to take an exam or write a final paper)
    * how can we use the tools of the LL to create documentation ("evidence" of student learning)
* key LL mechanics + tools
    * layering/obs/AI realtime production stuff
    * cameras/overhead
    * arts supplies
    * etc
* if we aren't going to do lab-focused sessions, could have this day be a bunch of demos ('the tools you need to learn to do your projects' kind of thing)
    * and maybe live-making resources with AI?
    * similar to a workflow they'd maybe want to use in a workshop - here's what we did and made and here's how we did it


## thurs. 08/29: session 4
* **key ideas for this day**:
    * curating as reflecting back to students what they did/the significance of it/the significance of their learning
    * creating multimedia reports for your depts to tell them about the amazing things you're seeing 'in the field' working with students in this capacity
    * creating tokens of learning for students that help them see key moments in their learning
    * rationales a big focus for today - how to tell the story of what happened in a way that resonates
* and related to above--if that's more of a tool focused day, this day could be about using the footage from tuesday to make a multimedia report
* could have them unpack media from other days of orientation on camera too - and augment this with AI to generate quick reports
* link this to mk idea of intro MDF project being a features piece about someone in their dept doing something that's multimodal/multimedia?
* also maybe do some stuff related to assessment this day
    * could ask Lara to lead this chunk since she did this last year for a few courses

## optional sessions
* Belle/QGIS (confirmed - date TBD)
* ATG (confirmed - date TBD)
    * menu of options/tools that ATG supports
    * emphasis on scalable support that Harvard-specific tools allow
    * intro to ATG staff who specialize in diff tools
* DAS - 8/21 2-3:30
* * HGSU - 8/26, 11:30 - 12
* Gabe?
* Pamela and Rebecca?
* related to labs?
    * codeLab
    * eventLab
    * avLab
    * 3dLab
    * graphicsLab

## things to integrate
* AI
    * Python
    * Slackbots?
* live capture of lots of cool moments/insights
* storytelling/rationales as core to role
    * end each day with reality tv style confessional - rationale booth
    * by end of orientation, we have a reality tv show for them 
* photo editing basics
    * color correction

## by end of orientation
* mdf orientation report for each department/mdf
* tons of media of mdfs for later reporting
* soundbites about their hopes for the year
*
