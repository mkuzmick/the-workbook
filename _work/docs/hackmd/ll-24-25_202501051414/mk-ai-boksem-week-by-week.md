# mk-ai-boksem-week-by-week

Teaching with Generative AI (Fall)
Led by Marlon Kuzmick and Learning Lab staff

Discover how generative AI can enhance your teaching practice. In this seminar, led by the Bok Center’s Learning Lab—an intergenerational team and studio space dedicated to creative teaching approaches—we will focus on the ChatGPT Edu tool, a resource that will soon be available to the Harvard community. Each week we will explore a different way to deploy AI tools in the classroom. The seminar is designed to be accessible to everyone - no coding experience is required. Join us to learn how AI can be integrated into your teaching to foster a more dynamic and interactive learning environment.

two weeks: intro to our tools and platforms
one week: deep dive into ethics
three weeks: prototyping and testing
