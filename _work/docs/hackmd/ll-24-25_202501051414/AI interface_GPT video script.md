### **Scene 1: Introduction**

**[Camera opens on Madeleine sitting at a desk with a laptop open displaying the ChatGPT EDU interface.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Hello everyone! Welcome to the Bok Center's Learning Lab. Today, we're going to walk you through the ChatGPT EDU interface and show you how to create your own Custom GPTs.*

---

### **Scene 2: Why Use ChatGPT EDU**

**[Cut to a close-up of the ChatGPT EDU interface on the laptop screen.]**

**Madeleine:**

*You might be wondering, why use ChatGPT EDU? Well, ChatGPT EDU is accessible to all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including faculty, students, and staff. It's offered through Harvard's workspace, which means we have stringent privacy and data protections. This is crucial if you're handling sensitive information or student data.*

---

### **Scene 3: Accessing ChatGPT EDU**

**[Madeleine gestures to the screen as she navigates to the login page.]**

**Madeleine:**

*To access ChatGPT EDU, simply go to chat.openai.com and log in using your Harvard credentials. Remember, single sign-on via Harvard Key isn't available yet, so you'll need to create a unique password for this account.*

---

### **Scene 4: Verifying Your Workspace**

**[Zoom in on the Harvard shield icon on the interface.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Once you're logged in, make sure you're in the Harvard workspace by checking for the Harvard shield icon in the top-right corner. Clicking on it gives you access to your account settings and customization options.*

---

### **Scene 5: Customizing ChatGPT**

**[Madeleine clicks on 'Customize ChatGPT' in the settings.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Let's start by customizing ChatGPT to better suit your needs. Click on the Harvard shield and select 'Customize ChatGPT.' Here, you can provide information about your role, the types of classes you teach, and even set the language or coding preferences. For example, if you frequently code in Python, you can set Python as your default coding language.*

---

### **Scene 6: Understanding Memories**

**[Madeleine navigates to 'Settings' and then 'Personalization' to show 'Memories.']**

**Madeleine:**

*A quick heads-up about 'Memories.' ChatGPT saves context from your interactions to improve future responses. However, if you're presenting or sharing your screen, be cautious. Accessing 'Memories' can reveal previous inputs that you might not want to display publicly. You can manage or clear your memories in the 'Settings' under 'Personalization.'*

---

### **Scene 7: Exploring the Interface**

**[Madeleine returns to the main interface and highlights different sections.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Now, let's explore the main interface. On the left sidebar, you'll find your chat history and any Custom GPTs you've interacted with. The main window is where all the magic happens—this is where you'll interact with ChatGPT.*

---

### **Scene 8: Selecting Models**

**[Madeleine clicks on the model dropdown menu.]**

**Madeleine:**

*At the top, you can select different models. The default is GPT-4, which is great for most tasks. There's also o1 (preview and mini), which offers advanced reasoning capabilities but doesn't support web browsing or file uploads.*

---

### **Scene 9: Starting a Conversation**

**[Madeleine initiates a new chat.]**

**Madeleine:**

*To start, simply type your question or prompt in the text box at the bottom. For example, let's ask, "Tell me about the major battles Joan of Arc fought in."*

**[ChatGPT generates a response.]**

**Madeleine:**

*As you can see, ChatGPT provides a detailed answer. However, it's important to critically assess the information, as it may sometimes be general or contain inaccuracies.*

### **Scene 10: Introducing Custom GPTs**

**[Madeleine clicks on 'Explore GPTs' in the sidebar.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Now, let's dive into Custom GPTs. These are specialized instances of ChatGPT tailored with custom instructions, tools, and documents. You can create your own or explore existing ones.*

---

### **Scene 11: Creating a Custom GPT**

**[Madeleine clicks on '+ Create' to start making a new GPT.]**

**Madeleine:**

*To create a Custom GPT, click on '+ Create.' You have two tabs here: 'Create' and 'Configure.' The 'Create' tab lets you describe your GPT in natural language, and the system will help set it up. The 'Configure' tab allows you to manually input all the details.*

---

### **Scene 12: Configuring Your GPT**

**[Madeleine switches to the 'Configure' tab.]**

**Madeleine:**

*In 'Configure,' you can set the name, description, and even an avatar for your GPT. The most crucial part is the 'Instructions' section. This is where you define how your GPT will behave, its tone, and its limitations.*

---

### **Scene 13: Adding Conversation Starters**

**[Madeleine scrolls to 'Conversation Starters.']**

**Madeleine:**

*You can also add conversation starters to guide users on how to interact with your GPT. This is especially useful if you're creating a GPT for your students.*

---

### **Scene 14: Uploading Knowledge Base**

**[Madeleine clicks on 'Knowledge' and uploads a document.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Under 'Knowledge,' you can upload files that your GPT can reference. This is great for creating a GPT that can answer questions about specific course materials or datasets. Supported file types include PDFs, text files, and images.*

---

### **Scene 15: Setting Capabilities**

**[Madeleine highlights the 'Capabilities' section.]**

**Madeleine:**

*In 'Capabilities,' you can enable features like web browsing, DALL·E image generation, and code interpretation. Be cautious with code interpretation if your knowledge base contains sensitive information.*

---

### **Scene 16: Testing and Finalizing Your GPT**

**[Madeleine interacts with the GPT in the preview window.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Once you've configured everything, test your GPT in the preview window on the right. Make sure it responds as expected. When you're satisfied, click 'Create' or 'Update' to finalize it.*

---

### **Scene 17: Sharing Your GPT**

**[Madeleine clicks on 'Share' options.]**

**Madeleine:**

*You can keep your GPT private, share it via a link, or publish it within the Harvard workspace. This allows your students or colleagues to access and use the GPT you've created.*

---

### **Scene 18: Best Practices and Ethics**

**[Madeleine turns to the camera for emphasis.]**

**Madeleine:**

*Before we wrap up, a quick note on best practices. Always be mindful of the ethical implications when creating and sharing GPTs. Ensure that your GPT complies with privacy policies and doesn't expose sensitive information.*

---

### **Scene 19: Conclusion**

**[Madeleine smiles and closes her laptop.]**

**Madeleine:**

*That's it for today's tutorial! You've learned how to navigate the ChatGPT EDU interface and create your own Custom GPTs. Feel free to explore and experiment, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Thanks for joining me, and happy GPT-making!*
