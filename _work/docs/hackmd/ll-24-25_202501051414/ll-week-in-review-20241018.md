## Events

### AI Open House (Zoom)

MW worked with MK and DD to prepare a [resource document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2_X8kkCMV2_rA9pEGoJHyVmUWQRWzbukR0iIx3Wv00/edit#heading=h.m180zn1matz6). The Zoom format does not lend itself to cover the whole of the rhetorical "rainbow,"" so the meeting consisted mostly of a guided activities during a walkthrough of the interface and the making of a GPT.

While this isn't the most vivacious content, it is a significant need for professors who need a bit more support. MW and MK will work next week to make a plan to record an "idealized" version of this walkthrough in the main studio with a screen cast. These modules can then be posted online with the new website copy.

### LL Bok Seminar: Teaching with Generative AI

In this second-to-last session of this Bok Seminar, students began to present on their capstone projects. This included GPTs and python notebooks across a range of domains, along with much discussion and Q&A following each presentation. This coming Tuesday will be the final day, when a majority of the attendees will be presenting. 

### HEB 140 one-on-one GPT workshop 

MW met with Cammie Curtin (TF) and Ritika Khanal (student) from HEB 140: Friendship to walk Rikita through the ChatGPT EDU interface and the creation of a GPT, all grounded in the context of the class. Specifically, the "workshop" consisted of creating the first draft of a GPT that would assist Ritika with the sourcing and formatting of citations for her final Research Proposal. Much of the content mapped onto the interface guide and GPT creation docs. The entire meeting took over an hour, mostly due to navigation struggles with Ritika's screen reader and creating workarounds to assist her with ease of movement between the needed pages in the ChatGPT EDU interface. However, Ritika was enthusiastic throughout and very excited about the ways in which ChatGPT EDU is already improving her educational experience and supporting her accessibility needs. She was very excited to create a GPT, not just for this class, but for her own needs.

### GENED 1145 Layering Video Essays Workshops
We hosted three workshops for sections of Global Japanese Cinema to help students level up their video essay skills. One zone prompted students to quickly prototype the moves of a video essay using paper materials, including theoretical texts from the syllabus, excerpts on technical film production techniques, and printed stills from the films they are studying. A second zone offered students an array of digital tools to explore that might help them apply some of those video essay moves using easy to learn options like Canva to more sophisticated options like adobe premiere and adobe after effects. A third zone challenged students recreate a shot from a film they've studied. In this "learning by doing" activity, they gained insight as makers to help them better articulate their analyses. We also documented visuals and student audio narration through two microphone stations, and utilized OpenAI API and Slack to transcribe, describe, translate into Japanese, and offer the take an imaginary Japanese Film Historian might have on the collective films we were creating over the course of this workshop. We additionally synthesized these materials into Netflix landing pages in the editing zone as a way of students quickly learning the editing interface of Canva.



### MUSIC 30 DAWs Workshop
MDF Leo led a workshop for MUSIC 30: Music to Re-imagine the World: From Afrofuturism to Experimental Music across Planet Earth, introducing students to audio editing with Audacity. Students explored the basics of manipulating sound, including techniques like trimming, echo, reverb, and fading. The class engaged in a hands-on activity, using a _zar_ track from Mazaher to recreate Halim el-Dabh's "Wire Recorder Piece," helping them reflect on the artistic possibilities of digital sound manipulation.

### MUSIC 223R Visualizing Music Theory in 2D and 3D Workshop
For MUSIC 223R: Neo-Riemannian Analysis, MDF Leo students were introduced to transformational theory through a 3D visualization of the Tonnetz. Using Blender, they learned how to animate chord progressions on a torus model and explored camera movements to enhance the visualization. The workshop focused on using materials and transparency settings to illuminate specific chords, giving students an interactive way to see musical transformations.


### ENG CACF Focus and Exposure Workshop
Casey worked with the ENG CACF: The Art of Community-Based Film, on using and understanding the DSLR cameras borrowed from Lamont Media Lab and implementing natural lighting to capture documentaries about community engagement.

### TDM 166H Class Visit
We hosted a brief introductory session for students from TDM 166H: TV Writers Room. Students were introduced to the Learning Lab's media-making resources, particularly the availability of studio time and technical consultations. The visit helped these advanced makers explore how they can integrate media tools into their future projects, including potential web-series or podcasts.


### GENED 1122 Podcasts and Documentary Workshop
MDFs Austin and Sophie led a split workshop on how to capture and edit interviews in podcast and documentary forms for GENED 1122: The Social Responsibilities of Higher Education. They helped explore the uses of various recording methods and how they can be implemented in supporting a story.

### MUSIC 250HFA Digital Teaching Tools Workshop
For the MUSIC 250HFA: Colloquium on Teaching Pedagogy, MDF Leo introduced the music graduate students to various digital tools for teaching and research. The session included a reflection on podcast and video essay formats, where students recorded a brief podcast and collaboratively analyzed a video essay. The focus was on developing their understanding of what makes effective digital media and how these techniques can be applied in their own work.

## Meetings
### Expos20 Strauss Consultation
We met with instructor Tracy Strauss to prepare for her two sections of Expos 20: Persona that are visiting the Learning Lab next week. In support of their capstone video essay assignment, we’ll introduce students to the form by analyzing a Vox-style video essay. We’ll focus on filming techniques using their phones and provide editing resources to help them translate their research into video format.

### HISTSCI 1490 Consultation
For HISTSCI 1490: The History and Culture of Stigma's capstone project, students are developing creative interventions related to stigma. We met with the course heads (Allan Brandt and Sara Press) to check in about where the students are at this point in the semester and finalize the plan for Jordan's visit next week. Jordan will discuss considerations for choosing the most effective form for their intervention and lead a Q&A and inform students about available resources (including one-on-one consultations or group sessions, depending on common themes).

### T127 Student Project Consultations

MW met with five HGSE students about their individual learning projects and their eventual capstones. They will all be working on GPTs, and one will be attemoting to make a tool in a python notebook. They will then present to HGSE students on their work during an evening Open House in November. 

### MDF Biweekly Meeting
With Christine out this week, the MDF meeting was spent helping prepare for the 2 subsequent MDF workshops happening a few hours later on in the day: Austin and Sophie's GENED 1122 workshop, and Leo's MUSIC 250 HFA workshop. 

### LLUF Weekly Meeting
With Jordan helping with a workshop at the same time as this meeting, Marlon led the LLUFs in preparing assets for both the MUSIC 250 HFA workshop and next week's EXPOS 20 Strauss workshops.

### T127 Weekly Meeting

MW did a python tutorial and a GPT walkthrough
