# Media & Design Fellow Projects in the Arts & Humanities

Media & Design Fellows support innovative course development, partnering with FAS faculty and Learning Lab staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials and content, and assignments for undergraduate courses and their departments. MDFs design interactive, technically complex learning experiences for students that help them grasp the affordances of different media, and they develop workshops and other forms of guidance that help students succeed in using new media to convey their ideas and demonstrate subject-matter expertise.

## Workshops

### Audio-focused Workshops

#### Music 51a: Theory Ia

MDFs Chris and Siriana Lundgren designed two workshops that introduced students to GarageBand. The goal of these workshops was to help students become proficient in digital audio workstation tools and working with MIDI. In the first workshop, students learned how to record instruments into MIDI, building a counter melody to a melody that already existed. In the second workshop, Chris and Siriana taught students about using MIDI instruments to play with a series of harmonic changes based on a song. This gave students the chance to think more actively about how melodies operate in relation to chord progressions. Chris and Siriana designed these workshops to increase students' proficiency with tools they are likely to encounter later in their musical studies and creative lives, grounding what students were learning in a tangible experience and putting theory into practice.

### Visual Essays + Multimedia Presentations

#### Music 29: Black Protest Music

Students in Black Protest Music have the option to create a video essay for their final project. Chris designed this workshop with an emerging practice in the field of music in mind: "There are some things that are difficult to just describe orally, and increasingly we see academic papers integrate score annotations or other visual things that help elucidate the arguments. People are just thinking more and more about how these visual elements can help their argument rather than sort of distract from it." Students came to the Learning Lab to learn about the different affordances of visual forms and to learn about some of the digital tools that exist to help one make a video essay. 
    
Chris designed the workshop to be divided into two main sections, audio and video, with the latter further divided into digital and physical tools for visualization. On the video side, which the speaker organized, students explored different methods of visualizing music. For example, participants were shown stop motion examples from Vox and experimented with making those themselves, and in another zone, students were encouraged to use colored paper to visualize how different parts of a pop song might relate to each other. Students also explored the 3D spatialization of sound, considering how the perceived location of a singer can influence the emotional impact of a song. On the digital side, participants experimented with spectrograms and scrolling text effects, learning how to use a tool like Adobe After Effects to make these assets. 

By participating in this workshop, students gained a deeper understanding of how video and audio, when paired together in the form of a video essay (or a music video), can convey the complexity of a given piece of music--allowing one to see the broader sonic, social, historical, and spaital personal context in which music is created and experienced.

#### Music 97f: Sophomore Tutorial Capstone Options Workshop
Jingyi Zhang's sophomore tutorial came to the Learning Lab to do a session with Chris about video essays, thinking about this as a possible form they could use for their final projects. Students learned about the different formal elements of the video essay and thought about how those formal moves would enable them to communicate their academic insights about music. 

#### GENED 1006: Music from Earth
This GENED course is about the Golden Record, which was on the Voyager satellite that took what, at the time, was considered the essence of human culture out into space for aliens to find one day. One week in the course is about the so-called Fermi Paradox, which can be challenging for students to understand given its complexity. Chris brought students to the Learning Lab to experiment with different ways to visualize the Fermi Paradox, as a way of augmenting their understanding and giving them a chance to apply what they were learning about this theory in an unconventional manner. Using the Learning Lab's art supplies, students crafted a small demonstration of how a solution or an answer to why we haven't encountered extraterrestrials. They developed short presentations based on their solutions to the Fermi Paradox that they then presented on the greenscreen. This exercise helped students develop their understanding of an abstract, thorny concept while giving them skills in critical thinking and presentation.

### Multimodal Communication for Graduate Students 
#### Music 250 HFA: Colloquium on Teaching Pedagogy
Chris brought graduate students in Music 250 HFA for a workshop about designing and scaffolding multimodal assignments. Chris stressed the importance of developing low-stakes, consistent ways for students to share their process when making a multimodal project; a key way to check in with students in this way is to design so-called scaffolding activities, where students perform some kind of key move in a media form or they turn in some component of the final project (e.g., a storyboard). The group also discussed how to assess multimodal projects, including what seems "fair game" to assess and what form that feedback might itself take.

### Other Workshops MDFs have supported
* Podcasting Workshops
* AI Workshops (using custom chat bots and image generators like Stable Diffusion)
* Presentation and Oral Communication Workshops
* Graphic Design Workshops (for slide design and research posters)
* 3D Modeling and Virtual Gallery Workshops
