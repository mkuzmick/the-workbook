# HAA 97R planning doc

## themes
* relationship between object and person
* capturing the thing itself
* how these are distinct modes of capture
* how each tells the story of the object

## goals
* totality and detail
    * not getting too focused on single detail 
    * not being so preoccupied with whole that they lose sight of nuance
    * learning how to do both simultaneously is key
* scale
    * some sort of ratio component (measuring tape or an object of known size)
    * angle and how this can manipulate perception of scale
* lighting
    * texture
    * dimensionality
* how to organize all of these images
    * and any other documentation you end making (like notes)
    * they have field work notebooks
    * they are dedicating a page or two in their notebooks with things they're noticing about the thing
    * relationship between image and text
    * and image and memory

## structure/flow
* introduce totality and detail as the overarcing theme
* then transition into stations
* zones
    * angle
    * lighting
    * scale
    * story of an object/oral notes about an object
* organization - tori will do with them AFTER the workshop

## activities
* angle
    * introduce the concept of keystoning
    * [checklist of angles](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shot-angles-in-film/)
    * take several from each angle (this is part of making sure you have usable images - don't take just one!)
* lighting
    * raking light (using a flashlight)
    * natural light (using the window - if there's still natural light)
    * overhead lighting (phones? or just going into a well-lit space)
    * warm versus cool light (gels and a softbox)
    * reflection (glass that covers the object so they have to figure out how to work around glass)
    * how to cope with shadow
    * spotlighting
    * what to do when flash isn't allowed
* scale
    * distance between camera and object
    * distance between object and other objects
    * using other objects to demonstrate scale
    * using measuring instruments to demonstrate scale
    * worst/best/weirdest - the "Goldilocks" challenge
    * objects and planes (where the objects are in relation to one another)
    * get things into the same picture plane
    * intentionally misconstrue the size of an object (to show how documentation can distort crucial aspects of materiality/objectness of the object)
* oral notetaking/story of an object in a minute
    * write down on cards 5 things you are noticing (2 mins)
    * then craft a quick 1-2 minute story about your object based on what you're seeing (1 min)
    * could do this in the small studio

## logistics
* 16 students
* 4 groups of 4
    * 2 groups at 1 station
    * and then switch

## to do
* find flashlights
* set up a couple of small mini-studios in the shelves with lights that click on and off
