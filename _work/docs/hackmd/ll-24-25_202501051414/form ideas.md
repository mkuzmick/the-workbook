- public domain review - collections and articles all based on historical media in the public domain
    - curated online collection/exhibit, where everything can be used freely
    - example: https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/visualizing-history-the-polish-system/
    - two functions: contextualizing the materials; providing a site where they are held and hosted and displayed 
    - foregrounds the evidence more than a traditional analytical essay
    - combines the "archive" and "scholarship" functions that are often separate
    - possible platform: are.na
- Half Earth Socialism game: text-based game about economic planning
    - https://play.half.earth/

## assignment idea: curated digital collection & essay
- *what are they making? what is one move students can do that will help them learn?*
- creating a visual archive that people can contribute to freely
- use something like are.na; think about using open-access sources
- having students describe curatorial direction they've taken and why; help them unpack the logic or motivating idea of the collection and think about how these influence the curation and display of sources
- each student makes a small collection including x number of visual sources and some interpretive text to accompany; then, all students spend time playing around in or contributing to each others' collections; then reflect on the process
