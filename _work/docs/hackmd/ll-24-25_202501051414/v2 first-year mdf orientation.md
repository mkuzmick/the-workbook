# v2 first-year mdf orientation

## tues. 08/20: backward + forward design
* **key ideas for this day**: 
    * backward design as an approach to take when designing assignments (and the importance of this in the multimodal assignment zone)
    * what do we want students to be able to do in our disciplines and in what ways is academic writing getting students there and NOT getting students there? what comes next after academic writing?
    * "forward" design
        * backward design wants us to identify the LOs, then determine what demonstrating proficiency would look like, THEN choosing what we'll do
        * rationales via fiorella + Mayer/generative learning
        * looking to a range of media forms and thinking about what they can do that academic writing can't
        * then thinking about why you'd have students work in/with those forms
* intro to LL + key Bok staff
* defining the dominant modes of communication in their fields
    * mapping out what this does
    * having rationles for them (or anti-rationales - rationales against them as worthy dominant modes!)
    * taking apart this machine
    * connecting to Bloom's taxonomy, etc. - our goals for students/what we want them to be able to do
    * rationales via Meyer
    * when does academic writing enable this
* what is multimodal communication? and how might it help us reach the goals we have for students?
    * maybe connect this to generative learning (and ask TB if she'd want to help out again?)
    * identifying key 'moves' of different media
        * have them articulate what these moves do
        * why they're significant
    * visual comm as intro (and gets them thinking about workshop mechanics like visualizing ideas)
* systems + onboarding
    * do this right before lunch instead of first thing?
    * have them use slack earlier but show them some key channels and any cals here
* serial and video essay
    * highlight this as key workshop opening
    * finding a model and unpacking it
* they find a media form and unpack it
    * then create a bite-sized activity that would help students learn what this form can do
* key for this day is helping them think about learning experiences for students, maybe even more so(???) than designing alternative assignments - thinking about things they could implement now (i.e., workshops)
* some kind of AI-augmented lookbook activity
    * captures what they say as they unpack their form
    * capture several stills of that and the form itself
    * and then captions to make it into a multimedia lookbook

## tues. 8/27: what can media do? pt. 2
* lots of AI on this day
    * marlon
    * madeleine
    * cd?
* senior MDFs around this day
    * Arianna
    * Tori
    * Kevin

## thurs. 08/29: multimedia storytelling + reporting
* **key ideas for this day**:
    * curating as reflecting back to students what they did/the significance of it/the significance of their learning
    * creating multimedia reports for your depts to tell them about the amazing things you're seeing 'in the field' working with students in this capacity
    * creating tokens of learning for students that help them see key moments in their learning
    * rationales a big focus for today - how to tell the story of what happened in a way that resonates
* and related to above--if that's more of a tool focused day, this day could be about using the footage from tuesday to make a multimedia report
* could have them unpack media from other days of orientation on camera too - and augment this with AI to generate quick reports
* link this to mk idea of intro MDF project being a features piece about someone in their dept doing something that's multimodal/multimedia?
* also maybe do some stuff related to assessment this day
    * could ask Lara to lead this chunk since she did this last year for a few courses
