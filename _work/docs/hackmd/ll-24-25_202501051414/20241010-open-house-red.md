## station planning 


- tools
    - ChatGPT Edu (and normal)
- activities
    - what does it do well? what not?
        - begin with something you're expert at to evaluate the output
            - for faculty, see the quality of its response to one of your assignments
            - for students, experiment with something you are and EXPERT at rather than something you are struggling with
    - what does it get wrong? (factually? ethically?)
        - try some image prompts to get at its understanding of cultural norms
            - "a happy couple"
            - "a family eating dinner"
            - "a teacher and a student"
        - try some prompts that tackle equity and inclusion
            - University of Delaware recommendation => "how should I help a student in an urban public school who is struggling with math" vs (in another chat) "how should I help a student at an elite private school who is struggling with math?" (clearly you're asking for the difference, but attend to the ways it copes with this difference)
            - "as an instructor of ___ how should I ____?"
            - can you help me find elements of my syllabus that ____?
