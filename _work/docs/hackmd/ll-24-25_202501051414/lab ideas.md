## messy notes 20240815
* jk could connect makingLab to arts & education/HGSE/making learning visible
    * have some readings that folks explore in this zone
    * how to support tdm and art-making, performance assignments
    * very informed by theory in this field
* web-based essay lab as another lab that has been interesting to folks over time
* games, Unity, etc.
* ai 
* avLab

goals
* somewhere between 2 and 4 (ideally no more than 3) labs
* some initial learning project - something related to your academic discpline (or an academic discpline) in the medium you're working with
* halloween could be the deadline for mdfs to complete ILPs? 
* llufs could learn from the mdfs, what they're doing in their lab. and then could consult with jk if they want to work on a project
* mdfs could sign up for lluf meetings after halloween (at least one from each lab) to teach the llufs
* *see one - do one - teach one*
    * mdfs do this. llufs see one. MAYBE do one, in consultation with jk
