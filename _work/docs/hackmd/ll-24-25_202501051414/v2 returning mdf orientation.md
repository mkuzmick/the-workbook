tuesday: 
* ll staff show a few things, 
    * overhead art supply and presentation
    * camera microphone tech thing
    * code-y AI thing
* then set the returners loose in pairs to start thinking about what they might want to do for the 15-45 minute experiences we want them to design and deliver
* and then finish the day by them pitching that

thursday:
* dry run 
* finalizing the mdf schedule (2 days in the middle) and figuring out what needs to be represented to make sure it's covered (content, tools, workshop mechanics)


mechanics to cover include:
* live presentation on green screen on top of something with music playing
* computer based technology workshop
* putting together an aggregation of media from a variety of students (montage, paper dolls)

in preparation:
* put together some readings - cd share with dani and madeleine, to help mk with for the august 14 faculty workshop
    * (from bill's syllabus, elements of teaching, other things mk has handed out, what is referenced in the LL articles)
