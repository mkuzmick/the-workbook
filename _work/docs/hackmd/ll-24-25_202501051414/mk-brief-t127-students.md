# mk-brief-t127-students

thank you again! My plan was to get them working together on a few resources, reading-group style. Perhaps one of the best articles your (mk) sourced for the Open House, a prompting guide ([Anthropic's](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) was my thought, byt let me know), and then have them read through [our update doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QDSdO5yfjHGlCLScmWjrP_u9SkW4-zs-gUcEUQBLqho/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6df15deb8c7k) to get a lay of the land. 

Then, I was going to pitch them their first learning project, get them started on how to go about working with our tech stack (adding them to a dev folder with colabs, getting Weici and Ryna API keys, getting Meghan and Dora login information for their chosen tool and showing them hack.md, and getting Jingjing into the studio and connecting her with Jordan.) 

They are coming in with a staggered schedule:

- **Weekly Meetings:**
  - **AI-Assisted Chatbots Group:**
    - **When:** Fridays, 2:30 PM – 4:00 PM
  - **Generative AI Demo Team:**
    - **When:** Fridays, 3:00 PM – 4:30 PM

[Here](https://app.slack.com/client/T0HTW3H0V/C07QUVB37RP) is their work channel. 

Here's some information on each student, with my ideas for a first learning project, for context:

## Student briefs: 


**Dora**, a former journalist and TV presenter, has three years of experience as an English language arts teacher. Dora expects the future of education to be a blended learning model and believes AI can help redefine the role of teachers in the classroom. She is more focused on k-12 education longterm, but she's very interested in the Harvard student experience and the subjective qualities of interacting with AI tools. HOWEVER, she noted that she is taking CS50 this year with Meghan. She is interested in python notebooks. 

* mw thoughts on a first learning project: 
    * choosing an AI tool that we use (replicate, RunwayML, stable diffusion, notebookLM, GPTs, etc.) and create a resourc document/station plan to your chosen audience (faculty, higher education students, k12 students)

**Jingjing** is a kindergarten teacher with four years of experience in an international school in China. She also has a background in Russian language and elementary education. Jingjing is interested in AI and wants to know how it can impact teaching and learning, especially in young children. She is especially fascinated by our phsyical space, and the more artistic/aesthetic elements of making a presentation. She is interested in design broadly, but especially for communication. 

* mw thoughts on a first learning project: 
    * communicating an AI tool or AI mechanic/term using one of our overhead cameras and whatever art supplies she can find around the studio. Might alsop be good to connect her with Jordan.

**Meghan**, a high school math teacher for 10 years, was also impacted by the influx of ed tech during the pandemic. Megan wants to leave teaching but stay in the education field and learn more about how to implement technology more thoughtfully. She is also interested in working with college students, having previously only worked with high school students. She noted that she is taking CS50 this year with Dora. She is interested in python notebooks (but perhaps later in the term).

    * choosing an AI tool that we use (replicate, RunwayML, stable diffusion, notebookLM, GPTs, etc.) and create a resourc document/station plan to your chosen audience (faculty, higher education students, k12 students)

**Weici** has a background in information science and experience building a chatbot during her undergraduate days at Cornell. However, she is not a dev, and was unable to describe the tech stack used to make the chatbot. Regardless, this experience has lead Weici to expand on her skill set and continue to build with new AI tools, specifically expressing interest in learning how to make API calls to OpenAI.

* mw thoughts on a first learning project: 
    * singles, working through every basic API call in a python notebook

**Ryan**, with an undergraduate background in computer science, worked as a paraeducator in a school for three years, gaining experience teaching and working with special needs students. Ryan’s experience observing the use of technology in the classroom led them to believe that technology could be more thoughtfully integrated into education. They hope to gain baseline knowledge of how AI models operate to be able to creatively apply that knowledge.

## Projects

### Generative AI for Educators Demo


- **Students:** Dora, Jingjing, Meghan

**Description:**

This project involves creating hands-on demonstrations of generative AI tools aimed at faculty clients. The goal is to introduce them to the functionalities and potential uses of generative AI in their curriculum. Students will develop and teach interactive presentations based on ongoing Learning Lab AI offerings. The final capstone may take the form of a studio installation, online gallery, or workshop.

### AI-Assisted Chatbots


- **Students:** Ryan, Weici

**Description:**

In this project, students will develop and refine AI-driven chatbots designed to support courses in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). The focus is on exploring and experimenting with a range of emerging AI tools and developing documentation to guide others through similar explorations. Students will test chatbot functionalities, provide feedback for improvements, and develop user guides for effective implementation.
