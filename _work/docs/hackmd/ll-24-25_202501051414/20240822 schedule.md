## arc
* AI
    * last time, we thought about the future of academic communication by examining podcasts--a common form in many courses we work with
    * today we're going to start out by thinking about AI--the most emergent form in the teaching and learning space
    * a key area of focus for the university this next year is in the area of chatbots for courses. this started with CS50 last year and has since been expanded into other courses across the College
    * to learn about this specific application of AI, we'll first get an experience of using a custom GPT, as a way of learning about its features, how a user interacts with it, and what it can allow us to do
    * then, we'll learn how to make one of these chatbots, gaining techincal experience in configuring and actions.
    * NOTE: there are a TON of other ways we've used AI and are excited to think about AI's applications (mention Whisper here), so if you're interested in learning more about this, consider teaming up with aiLab folks to do deep dives on this
* Cinema, Animation, Video Games
    * chatbots help students outside of the classroom, give them ways to deepen their understanding of course material - analogous to more conventional modes of outside of class work/formative assessments (like discussion posts, quizzes, reading questions, drafting and outlining, etc.)
    * making in these forms lets students make something of the same quality and kind as they're studying
    * we're using film and video games as the example forms here but this kind of activity could be extrapolated to the other forms too (infographics, datavis, etc.)
    * often what we do at the LL is help students get a hands-on experience of making, as a way of deepening their understanding of the way a form they're studying works
    * we're going to get some experience thinking about 3 key forms that developed in film and media history: cameras + lights, animation, and video games
    * and we'll introduce you to some of the workshop mechanics we've developed to help students learn about form through the process of remaking a shot from a film and designing a video game character
