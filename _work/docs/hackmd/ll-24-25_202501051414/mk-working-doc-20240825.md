### updates

Monday:
- faculty consultation with two professors working with the Music Department's Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry program to discuss Learning Lab workshops this term that will incorporate Generative AI for student media projects
- faculty consultation with professor from the History of Science interested in having students create Custom GPTs themselves as an assignment option, but also discussed using the data analysis and translation capabilities to democratize access to large multi-lingual datasets for qualitative and quantitative analysis.
- 
Tuesday: 
- We met with to consult on AI tools for AFVS students creating animations, etc. Our MDF for AFVS will be supporting this collaboration.

Wednesday:
- We met with the Chinese language course instructors involved in the tutor-bot pilot to support their development of custom GPTs 


Thursday: 


- We taught all new MDFs how to create Custom GPTs at Thursday's session of the new MDF orientation.
- Adam and Tamara planned the Bok session for the NFI and met with Marlon to think of a 20-25 minute activity to get new instructors started with ChatGPT--we will be delivering this on both Monday and Tuesday of next week.
- We developed materials for the Open House, including sample Custom GPTs as well as detailed step-by-step walkthroughs for instructors new to ChatGPT (thanks go to Madeleine for both!)
    - one on [setting up an account and getting started with the interface](https://tinyurl.com/chatpgt-edu-interface)
    - and one on [creating custom GPTs](https://tinyurl.com/creating-custom-gpts)

Friday:
- We continue to add new Custom GPTs built for the Open House and clients to [the GPT Airtable Base](https://airtable.com/appyCWY4NLUfhztnx/tblGCr9GhPypflKHg/viw6ayaToIkJ7eMbf?blocks=hide), for now a purely internal tool, but we will make a number of these into public templates published by the Bok Center if and when we can get an organizational GPT acct for the Bok Center
- the Open House itself was a success for those who came:
    - we had partipants from SEAS, Chem, NELC, HAA--so a wide variety of disciplines (evenly balanced across the divisions)
    - Adam and Jonah worked on developing ways of using Google Docs as a more natural drafting area for GPT prompts by working on a Custom GPT that would provide instructors with answers from key Harvard documents on teaching rules and regulations, best-practices, etc.
    - Adam and Anza consulted Chemistry Preceptors working with Greg Kestin's Teach GPT tool and showed them the similarities and differences between that platform and ChatGPT Edu. Also consulted on ways of framing the use of Generative AI for the course to set student expectations, etc
    - MK worked with NELC faculty on Custom GPTs, including work on making the Hebrew Bible more accessible for students with a range of different ability levels with Ancient Hebrew
    - Madeleine worked with folks from SEAS
