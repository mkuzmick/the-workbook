# Camera Basics - ENG CACF Image Workshop

## Exposure Triangle

These are the variables that are required for a camera to properly accept light. They're also the variables you can balance between to change the way an image looks.

The triangle is made up of 3 variables: 
* Aperture - The iris of the lens, that accepts or limits light from reaching the sensor. This is notated as f/##, indicating a fraction of the lens length -- an equation for how wide the iris is open.
* Shutter speed - How much time the shutter spends open, again a method of allowing or preventing light to enter the sensor. This is notated as a fraction of a second. 
	* When shooting on video/film, you almost always want this to be locked at half of your frames per second. 
	* In photography, if you're shooting handheld, you want it to be the same as your lens length(100mm = 1/100, or 50mm = 1/50)
* ISO is how much or little electronic signal is required to bring your image "up" to its exposure. In audio, this is a direct comparison to the way Gain functions. The general guidance is the higher this is, the more grainy or "noisy" the image is.

### Challenge: Three Shot Story

Every story follows an arc, simple ones can be built in as little as 2 shots. You're always looking for a tension and resolution. Because of the way that film (and film narrative) has historically developed, we expect there to be some kind of relationship between the sequences of shots in a film. 

Your challenge for this exercise is to
* capture three distinct videos, each with a unique shot length and composition (so, each shot is different from the others)
* these shots, when viewed together and arranged in a particular sequence, should tell some kind of a story
* what mystery/tension/question will your opening shot establish?
* and how will your second and third shot add to/complicate/or maybe even resolve that tension?

You can experiment with lighting, framing, shot length, and any other formal elements that add to your film's story. 

# Lighting

## Key to Fill Ratios and 3 Point Lighting

Lighting is mostly a creative tool, meaning there are many ways to do it and most of them have valid reason. But, there are some methods that are simply more frequently put into use than others. 

Three Point Lighting is the most frequently talked about approach to lighting a subject. But in truth, I've found this to be a bit of a misnomer, as you don't always require 3 points of light in a 3 point lighting setup.

Most commonly, you'll find that a Key light and a Back light are the most useful to have, but the Fill light can be replaced by a bounce, a white wall, or even ignored altogether, depending on some attributes of your key light. 

But to start, you should set up your Key light, this is most commonly placed between 30 and 45 degrees from the front of your subject. This is most commonly your brightest light, it will determine your exposure most of the time. Next, determine if this should be a hard or soft light, if you're using a soft Key light, this can negate the need for a ![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bVuicRH-J4/maxresdefault.jpg)

Next, you'll decide your Key to Fill Ratio. This is the difference between the levels of brightness between each side of your subject's face, with your Key being the brighter of the two. 

**It's extremely common in interviews to light at a relatively low ratio.**

If you remember back to our metering exercises, you can determine this difference mathematically by metering each side of your subject's face. This is most important to happen when you're shooting at a high ratio, as you run a greater risk of over or under exposing one side of your subject's face.

### Challenge Perfect Portrait

Portraiture is an art of its own, but there are some tricks that can be utilized to capture a gorgeous shot with relatively little need. 
* First, you'll want to open your aperture as wide as it'll go, this is going to narrow the focus to its shortest depth of field. For clarity, this will be the lowest number on your aperature ring.
* Next, find a big, soft source of lighting. This is going to soften the features of the subject you're photographing. Harder sources can be slightly more difficult to work with, as it casts more rigid shadows. 
	* Align this light 45 degrees from your subject, so that it's filling in the majority -- but not all -- of your subject's features.
* Finally, adjust your shutter speed until your exposure meter is centered.
