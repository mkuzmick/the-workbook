## Ideas for GPT Creation
### Language-learning GPTs
Create GPTs that serve the pedagogical purpose of increasing langauge skills. These GPTs can particularly help with the following skills:
1. **Conversational Partner**
ChatGPT's advanced voice assistant can simulate real-time conversation and also give pronunciation advice where needed. Students can simulate real-time dialogue with the GPT, learning how to respond to questions on the fly, talk about various topics, and hear new words. These conversations can be enhanced through topical words. For example, a unit's vocabulary list can be uploaded into the GPT and a general speaking level ability can be suggested. Then, the GPT can simulate a conversation, using new vocabulary words in context. Once the student chooses to end the conversation, the GPT can go over new words that were used and errors in noted in speech (grammar, pronunciation, etc.).
3. **Grammar Instructor**
A GPT designed to give detailed grammar instruction in multiple languages. This GPT would be able to:
- Provide clear, contextual examples of grammatical rules.
- Offer targeted exercises or quizzes on specific grammar points (e.g., verb tenses, articles, sentence structure).
- Analyze student writing for grammatical errors and explain why certain mistakes were made, offering corrected examples.
- Adapt lessons based on the student's proficiency level, allowing gradual progression through increasingly complex grammatical rules.
- Provide real-time grammar corrections during conversational exercises.
3. **Vocabulary Builder**
A GPT that focuses on building vocabulary by:
- Generating custom word lists based on student preferences or areas of study (e.g., business, travel, science).
- Providing spaced-repetition flashcards, quizzes, and games to reinforce vocabulary learning.
- Creating example sentences and short passages using new words in context.
- Offering synonym and antonym suggestions to deepen understanding of each word.
- Tracking word usage during conversations or written exercises to monitor vocabulary growth.

4. **Writing Assistant**
A GPT that helps language learners improve their writing skills by:
- Analyzing text for clarity, cohesion, and appropriate tone.
- Offering stylistic suggestions, including sentence variety and word choice.
- Providing feedback on how to write effectively in various genres, such as essays, letters, and creative writing.
- Supporting different levels of formality, from casual conversation to academic or professional writing.

5. **Listening Comprehension Partner**
A GPT focused on improving listening comprehension by:
- Simulating conversations or playing audio clips in different accents and speeds.
- Asking comprehension questions or requesting summaries of what was heard.
- Offering immediate feedback and explanations for misunderstood phrases or words.
- Adjusting the difficulty of audio content based on the learner's skill level.

6. **Language Games and Puzzles**
A GPT that uses gamified methods to teach language skills:
- Engaging students with word puzzles, crosswords, or trivia quizzes in the target language.
- Encouraging friendly competition with leaderboards and timed challenges.
- Including storytelling games where students help co-create stories, using specific vocabulary or grammar rules.
- Offering interactive scenarios where students must use language skills to solve problems (e.g., navigating a foreign city or participating in a mock interview).

7. **Test Preparation**
A GPT specialized in preparing students for standardized language exams (e.g., TOEFL, DELE, JLPT) by:
- Offering timed practice tests in reading, writing, listening, and speaking sections.
- Giving targeted feedback on test performance, highlighting areas of improvement.
- Providing sample essays, audio clips, and questions tailored to specific exam formats.
- Simulating oral exam conditions to build confidence in speaking sections.
### Week-scheduler GPTs

1. **Event Aggregator GPT**
This GPT scrapes emails from all the Harvard house listservs and compiles a comprehensive schedule of campus events. Key features could include:
- **Automated Email Parsing**: The GPT could automatically gather emails from house listservs, clubs, departments, and other campus organizations to extract relevant event information like dates, times, locations, and topics.
- **Centralized Event Database**: All the parsed events would be stored in a centralized database, making it easy to search and filter based on various criteria.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Users could input natural language queries like "What guest speakers are on campus this week?" or "Are there any club sports events tomorrow?" and receive personalized suggestions based on the event database.
- **Interest-Based Suggestions**: By learning user preferences (e.g., types of events they enjoy or clubs they're involved in), the GPT can offer tailored event recommendations that align with their interests.
  
2. **Event Search and Filters**
This GPT could allow users to search for events using advanced filtering options:
- **Date and Time Filters**: Users could search for events happening on specific dates or within particular time windows.
- **Location-Based Suggestions**: The GPT could suggest events happening near specific locations on campus or within a short walking distance.
- **Category-Based Filters**: Events could be filtered by categories like academic talks, social events, fitness classes, club meetings, networking events, etc.
- **Recurring Event Detection**: The GPT could identify recurring events (e.g., weekly club meetings or monthly guest speakers) and notify users when those events are coming up.

3. **Calendar Integration**
To make event planning even easier, the GPT could:
- **Sync with Personal Calendars**: After suggesting an event, the GPT could sync with users' Google Calendars or iCal to automatically add the event to their schedule.
- **Event Overlap Detection**: It could alert users if an event they are interested in conflicts with another event already on their calendar and offer suggestions for alternative times or events.
- **Daily or Weekly Summaries**: The GPT could send users a daily or weekly digest of upcoming events that match their interests, keeping them informed about what’s happening on campus.

4. **Event Notifications and Reminders**
The GPT could also function as a notification system:
- **Reminders**: Users could opt-in for reminders about events they’ve expressed interest in, with customizable time frames (e.g., "remind me 30 minutes before the event starts").
- **Real-Time Updates**: The GPT could notify users of last-minute changes, cancellations, or location updates for events they plan to attend.

5. **Social Integration**
The Week-scheduler GPT could incorporate social features:
- **Group Event Planning**: The GPT could help groups of friends coordinate which events they want to attend together by suggesting events that fit everyone’s schedules and interests.
- **RSVP Features**: It could allow users to RSVP for events directly through the platform, making it easier for event organizers to gauge attendance.
- **Event Sharing**: Users could share event details with friends via messaging platforms, email, or social media directly from the GPT’s interface.

6. **Recommendation Engine**
A powerful recommendation engine could be built into the GPT:
- **Event Discovery**: Users could discover new events based on past interactions, clubs they’re part of, or departments they’re interested in.
- **Trending Events**: The GPT could highlight popular or trending events on campus, helping students stay informed about high-profile guest speakers, big sporting events, or major social gatherings.
- **Interest-Based Grouping**: By learning from users' interests, the GPT could recommend clusters of events for people to attend over the course of a day or week, allowing for more comprehensive planning around favorite topics or activities.




### Dhall Hacks GPT
1. **Food Finder** 
A GPT that focuses on importing the weekly HUDS menu and outlining its various options. People with certain dietary restrictions or eating habits will be able to preemptively peruse the Harvard menu, query using natural language about possible selections, and, therefore, make a decision on where to eat to cater to proper diet.
2. **Bowl Maker**
Take a photo of ingredients in the dhall and be returned a potential bowl creation that uses culinary expertise. This creation can account for calories or certain diets to yield.
3. **Meal Prep Planner**
This GPT could offer meal prep strategies for students who want to organize their meals for the week:
- **Weekly Meal Plan Suggestions**: Based on the weekly HUDS menu, the GPT could suggest meals for the entire week, focusing on balanced nutrition and meal diversity.
- **Portion Control**: The GPT could offer advice on portion sizes based on individual dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain) and provide a strategy for building balanced plates.
- **Batch Cooking Tips**: For students who prefer to take extra food for later, the GPT could suggest meals that work well for batch cooking or storing for future consumption.
