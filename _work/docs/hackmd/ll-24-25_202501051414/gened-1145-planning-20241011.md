digital tools and exploded view

print outs from clips being sent today

student narrating with the godzilla, some elements of silent film workshop where stations tie together. 

make a trailer, AI generated VO material, but ofc they can do ther onw thing

show them cool things in Ae, but just so that thing exists, but sliding scale from canva to that. get them to do the canva stuff on the spot.

ADDING LAYERS to your video essay to level it up. Layering is a motif in everything.
