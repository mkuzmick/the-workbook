# Week 4: Paths
## Ideas
- "Path Tracing" in UE5- Explore rendering methods for our virutal production work includng "Path Tracing"
    - The Path Tracer is a progressive, hardware-accelerated rendering mode that mitigates the disadvantages of real-time features with physically correct and compromise-free global illumination, reflection and refraction of materials, and more. It shares the ray tracing architecture built into Unreal Engine, with minimal to no additional setup required to achieve clean, photoreal renders.

- Procedural Paths through [Something]
    - Blender Geometry Nodes

    - Paths through terrain (make river or road) or displacing a map plane to show route etc.
        - How to incorporate into Virtual Production?

- Animation along paths in Blender or UE
    - Feel pretty good about this already in both softwares but could brainstorm applications in live production.
