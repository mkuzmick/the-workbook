# AI Tools for Language Instructors links & resources

## description
This workshop explores practical applications of AI in foreign language teaching, including tools for creating tiered readings, facilitating oral assessments, and enhancing engagement with constrained vocabularies. Led by Learning Lab experts and featuring insights from leading researchers, the session provides a hands-on introduction to AI tools, ranging from low-code solutions to advanced approaches. Participants examine ways to integrate AI thoughtfully into their teaching, fostering curiosity, experimentation, and effective pedagogy. The event includes opportunities for discussion, collaboration, and Q&A, with a focus on supporting instructors of less commonly taught languages.
