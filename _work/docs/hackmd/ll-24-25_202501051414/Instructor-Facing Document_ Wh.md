### **Instructor-Facing Document: Why Assign an Exhibition or Curation Assignment in a History Course**

**Purpose and Rationale**

Assigning an exhibition or curation project in a history course serves multiple pedagogical goals, enriching students' learning experience while helping them develop transferable skills:

1.  **Communication Beyond Academia**  
    Students are challenged to translate academic content for diverse, public audiences, fostering an ability to make complex ideas accessible. This skill is increasingly valued across disciplines and aligns with broader institutional goals of sharing knowledge beyond the university's walls.
2.  **Alignment with Course Objectives**  
    These assignments assess students' understanding of course content comprehensively. Unlike traditional academic papers that often focus narrowly, exhibitions require students to engage with the breadth of the course material, offering a holistic demonstration of their learning.  
3.  **Adaptation to Emerging Technologies**  
    Creative assignments like virtual exhibits respond to the evolving academic landscape, where generative AI and other technologies play a significant role. Encouraging students to explore modes of expression beyond writing prepares them for future challenges and opportunities in communication.    
4.  **Historical and Contextual Relevance**  
    Exhibitions align with the discipline of history. Museums and exhibits are historically rooted methods of communicating complex narratives, making this medium particularly suited to history courses. Students also critically engage with the history and role of museums in shaping narratives.
    
**Practical Considerations for Implementation**

-   **Balancing Conceptual and Technical Effort**  
    Ensure the technical requirements of the assignment do not overshadow the intellectual goals. Students should spend more time engaging with course material than struggling with unfamiliar tools. Provide guidance or resources for managing this balance.   
-   **Leveraging Support Resources**  
    Encourage students to utilize available support, such as learning labs or instructional technology staff, to navigate new tools and software. This ensures they can focus on conceptual depth rather than being hindered by technical challenges.   
-   **Scaffolding the Assignment**  
    Break the project into smaller, manageable steps (e.g., brainstorming themes, selecting artifacts, designing layouts) to help students stay organized and reduce overwhelm.
