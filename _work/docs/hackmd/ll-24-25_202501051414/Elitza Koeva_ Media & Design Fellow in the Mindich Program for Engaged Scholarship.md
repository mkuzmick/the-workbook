Media & Design Fellows provide direct support to specific courses, helping students develop and complete multimodal assignments. MDFs also host workshops in multimodal communication, multimodal storytelling, and presentation techniques. They also provide general support to their departments by developing resources and hosting events that support multimodal scholarship.

In this report, you can read about:
* The **training with the Learning Lab** Elitza did to get ready to support projects in MPES
* Elitza's **project** in support of the MPES

## Learning Lab Training

During MDF orientation in August and throughout the bi-weekly fall MDF meetings, Elitza learned:
* how to **design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources** that help students in the particular courses they are supporting.
* a set of **multimodal pedagogy and instructional design best practices** and ways of connecting it to their discipline
* **the affordances of different media** and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

Throughout her time with the Learning Lab, Elitza has also specialized in certain tools, given her projects. These include:
* **Adobe InDesign**, an industry-standard tool used for graphic design and layout
* **Adobe Premiere Pro**, the industry-standard video editing tool used for film projects
* **AI tools**, including custom GPTs, Stable Diffusion, and other multimodal AI APIs
* **digital audio workkstations** (DAWs) that can be used for editing sound
* **microphones**, including dynamic mics, condenser mics, and cardioid mics, as a way of exploring and understanding their different audio qualities
* **Next.js**, a React framework, and some basic **javascript**, to explore contemporary web development and web-based displays

## Program Support

### Engaged Scholarship Resource for Faculty
Elitza is designing a visual representation of the processes and components of engaged scholarship. The goal of this resource is to distill the abstract concepts and theories that inform engaged scholarship into an accessible form. This resource will help MPES faculty understand what the Mindich program does and see how the various components of engaged scholarship fit together as a pedagogical practice. In its final form, it will be a pamphlet or booklet that faculty can reference as they consider as they design their courses.
