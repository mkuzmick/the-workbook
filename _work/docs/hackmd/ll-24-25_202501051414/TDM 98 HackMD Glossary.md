## Workshop Overview:
Producing Multimodal Performance

**Objective**: This workshop is designed to give you hands-on experience with creating multimodal performance art. You’ll rotate through four key production stations: AI & Character Generation, Camera & Projection, Audio, and Set Design. Each station introduces a unique part of the performance-making process and will guide you through building a finished piece.

### 1. AI & Character Generation Zone
   - **What You’ll Do**: Use AI to create characters and story lines to bring to life. Learn how to use AI in real time as your personal dramaturgical assistant.
      - **Create Characters**: Use AI software to design virtual characters that can be animated or projected in your performance.
      - **AI-Driven Storyboarding**: Try out AI storyboarding tools to plan out the scenes and character journeys visually.
   - **Key Terms**:
      - **Dramaturgy**: The art of crafting and structuring a performance’s narrative elements, including themes, styles, and character motivations. It involves a comprehensive analysis of the text, researching historical and cultural contexts, and collaborating with directors and designers to ensure a cohesive interpretation of the material. Dramaturgy also encompasses the development of production elements that support the storytelling, guiding the creative team in translating the script into a compelling performance. By focusing on both the written work and its performance, dramaturgy enhances the overall impact and coherence of a theatrical piece, allowing for deeper audience engagement and understanding.
      - **Scripting**: The process of writing dialogue, stage directions, and other elements that guide a performance’s structure and flow. In the context of Fluxus, scripting can be flexible and open-ended, allowing for spontaneity and audience interaction as part of the artistic process.
      - **Character Arc**: The transformation or inner journey of a character throughout a narrative, often characterized by growth or change as a response to conflicts and challenges faced during the story.
      - **Storyboarding**: A visual representation of a sequence of events in a narrative, typically using sketches or images to outline scenes and character interactions, aiding in the planning of a performance or film.
   - **Exploring Fluxus with AI**
      - **What You’ll Explore**: Discover how Fluxus, an experimental art movement, aligns with the rule-based capabilities of AI. Fluxus artists emphasized the artistic process over the finished product, engaging in performances that involved predefined rules and audience interaction. You’ll experiment with AI-generated scores and instructions that can guide your performance in a Fluxus-inspired way.
      - **Key Activities**:
         - **AI Rule Creation**: Develop a set of rules for your AI to follow, simulating the Fluxus approach of structured spontaneity in performance.
         - **Interactive Performance Elements**: Create AI-generated instructions or scores that invite audience participation, reminiscent of Fluxus performances like Yoko Ono's *Cut Piece*, where Yoko, let the audience cut off her clothing, and thus influenced the outcome of the art.
   - **Key Terms**:
      - **Fluxus**: An international, interdisciplinary movement from the 1960s and 1970s characterized by experimental art performances and a focus on the creative process rather than the final product. Fluxus artists engaged in a variety of media, generating new forms of art, including intermedia and conceptual art, which challenged traditional notions of performance and audience engagement.
      - **Intermedia**: A term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins, referring to art forms that blend and transcend traditional media boundaries, creating works that involve multiple disciplines and engage audiences in new ways.
      - **Audience Participation**: An integral aspect of Fluxus performances, where the audience becomes part of the artistic process, actively engaging with and influencing the work. This concept challenges the traditional spectator-artist relationship, encouraging interaction and co-creation.

### 2. Camera & Projection Zone
   - **What You’ll Do**: Experiment with capturing video and projecting it to create immersive effects.
      - **Camera Basics**: Get hands-on with cameras, exploring how different setups, angles, and lighting affect the look of your footage.
      - **Projection Mapping**: Try projecting your videos onto different surfaces to create a layered, 3D effect.
   - **Key Terms**:
      - **Cinematography**: The art of capturing visual storytelling on camera, where the choice of framing, lighting, movement, and camera angle impacts the audience’s perception. Cinematography includes everything from wide shots that show the whole scene to close-ups that capture an actor’s expressions.
      - **Projection Mapping**: A technique where visuals are projected onto 3D surfaces to create optical illusions or add depth to a performance. By aligning projections precisely to objects, walls, or floors, projection mapping creates immersive environments that can interact with live or virtual elements.
      - **Framing**: How a subject or scene is captured within the camera’s viewfinder, affecting what the audience sees and feels. Framing can highlight specific details or direct focus on characters or objects, often contributing to a scene’s overall emotion or tension.
      - **Avant-Garde**: Experimental and nontraditional art that pushes creative boundaries and challenges conventional narratives or formats. In theater, avant-garde performances often break the fourth wall, use abstract or symbolic language, and encourage the audience to think critically about the material.

### 3. Audio Zone
   - **What You’ll Do**: Explore how sound can change the mood and help tell your story.
      - **Sound Design**: Experiment with layering different sounds, effects, and voices to bring your scenes to life.
      - **Voice and Foley**: Record sounds to match on-screen actions or environments and see how these can impact your work.
   - **Key Terms**:
      - **Sound Design**: The process of creating and mixing audio to complement the visual elements of a performance. It involves selecting or recording sounds, music, and effects that set the atmosphere and evoke emotional responses, often shaping how the audience interprets the action.
      - **Foley**: Custom sounds created to match the actions on screen, such as footsteps, door creaks, or rustling fabric. Named after sound pioneer Jack Foley, this technique enhances realism and helps immerse the audience by closely syncing sounds with movements.
      - **Spatial Audio**: A type of audio that gives the illusion of sound coming from various directions. By creating a three-dimensional sound field, spatial audio can place sounds around the audience, immersing them more fully in the environment.

### 4. Set Design Zone
   - **What You’ll Do**: Learn to design both physical and digital sets that help create the right atmosphere for your performance.
      - **Physical vs. Virtual Sets**: Explore creating tangible set pieces and digitally designed environments that can interact with your projections or virtual characters.
      - **Styling the Scene**: Experiment with color, textures, and materials to match the tone of your project.
   - **Key Terms**:
      - **Set Design**: The art of creating the physical environment for a performance, including scenery, props, and spatial arrangement. Set design shapes how the story unfolds visually, enhancing themes and helping the audience understand context, time, and place.
      - **Environment Styling**: The choice of color schemes, textures, and materials that establish a setting’s mood and tone. Through environmental styling, designers create an aesthetic that complements the narrative and adds emotional depth to the performance.
      - **Abstract Setting**: A stylized, non-literal approach to set design that uses shapes, colors, and symbols to evoke emotions or ideas rather than a realistic environment. Abstract settings can highlight themes and allow the audience to interpret the space more freely.
      - **Accent Lighting**: A focused lighting technique that highlights specific areas, characters, or objects onstage, adding emphasis or creating mood. Accent lighting can direct the audience’s attention or evoke specific feelings, often adding layers of meaning to a scene.
