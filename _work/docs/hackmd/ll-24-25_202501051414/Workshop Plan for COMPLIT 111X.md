### Workshop Plan for COMPLIT 111X: Experimenting with Documentation and Visual Presentation

**Date:** November 18, 2024  
**Instructors:** MK+CD

**Workshop Goals:**

1.  Guide students in documenting creative processes and developing an awareness of how documentation style affects viewer interpretation.
2.  Encourage hands-on experimentation with different media for presenting visual narratives, allowing students to think critically about presentation and curation choices.

**Structure of the Workshop:**

#### Part 1: Object Creation and Documentation

-   **Objective:** Students create an object (using various materials) and document the process.
-   **Materials Provided:** Paper, scissors, clay, printmaking supplies, basic weaving materials, music supplies, and an array of iPhone accessories (tripods, for example).
-   **Documentation Techniques:**
    -   Introductory session on basic film and photography techniques, focusing on shot types, angles, lighting, and framing.
    -   Pairs of students will alternate roles: one creates an object while the other documents using an iPhone or camera. They’ll explore basic and experimental approaches to capturing their work (e.g., close-ups, timelapses, audio overlays).

#### Part 2: Curating and Presenting Visual Content

-   **Objective:** Each student develops a short presentation of their documented work.
-   **Tools and Methods:** Introduction to Canva as a versatile tool for digital presentations, covering options like:
    -   Virtual galleries
    -   Video montages
    -   Collages and photo essays
    -   Interactive website layouts
-   **Activity:** Students work with their documentation to create a visual narrative using Canva. They'll explore how different formats influence the viewer’s perception, understanding chronological sequences, thematic continuities, and interactive elements.

#### Concluding Discussion

-   **Objective:** Reflect on how different media forms affect storytelling and message delivery.
-   **Topics Covered:**
    -   How choice of documentation and presentation media can transform the meaning of a project.
    -   Potential for using these techniques in final projects.

### Preparation Tasks

1.  **Materials and Equipment Preparation:**
    
    -   Gather a range of art supplies: paper, clay, printmaking tools, weaving materials, and basic music instruments.
    -   Prepare iPhone tripods and any necessary photography accessories (e.g., ring lights, stabilizers) to assist with documentation.
    -   Ensure that each iPhone has access to Canva, and provide any required login credentials.
2.  **Set Up Documentation and Presentation Stations:**
    
    -   **Documentation Station:** Arrange materials and cameras with tripods for object-making activities.
    -   **Editing/Presentation Station:** Set up Canva on iPads or laptops for the presentation phase.
3.  **Visual Inspiration and Stylistic Examples:**
    
    -   Review and prepare examples of media types discussed in the course (e.g., Viennese Actionists, Abramović and Ulay, and arpilleras).
    -   Arrange visual materials or handouts with these examples to help students draw inspiration for documentation and presentation styles.
4.  **Workshop Flow Prep for Instructors:**
    
    -   Christine and Marlon: Discuss and rehearse how to introduce documentation techniques and Canva’s capabilities in relation to students' work.
    -   Familiarize themselves with examples provided by Matylda, preparing to reference these works to illustrate documentation and presentation options.
5.  **Feedback Mechanism:**
    
    -   Prepare a space or a prompt for students to leave feedback or reflections on the documentation and presentation techniques after the workshop.
