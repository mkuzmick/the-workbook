# staff meeting 20240910

## cd messy notes
* here's what we've been working on
* here's how it connects to the priorities for the year
* through mdfs - a mix of newly emergent and ongoing priorities
    * most come in because ongoing relations with depts who are excited about their work on scicomm, visual and oral comms, explainer videos, afvs folks becoming more capable of analyzing the things they study (like film)
    * we're giving mdfs more training in skills they need to support department work with AI tools
    * when it comes to relationship between new and old things - longstanding support in depts on mulitmodal comms 
    * and this year we're integrating AI into these departmental priorities
* how we train mdfs at orientation
    * and then a course they're supporting
    * lara in complit helped already with complit 200 and will help out with complit 207 and a translation studies seminar 
    * aden is helping out with AI tools for animation
* one of my key roles is getting mdfs trained and setting them up to be successful doing these projects in their departments and responding to these internal needs - this includes connecting mdfs to internal resources
    * for ex scicomm mdfs
    * i team up with jordan to make sure they're learning the skills they need in this zone
