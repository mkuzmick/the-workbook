**Recreating a Shot: Learning Through Precision and Perspective** 

Recreating a shot is a classic exercise in visual storytelling, often used in introductory film courses as a hands-on way to develop technical and analytical skills. By setting a clear target—a specific shot to replicate—students gain a focused framework for learning. This approach helps them practice working with cameras, lights, and composition while offering an objective measure for self-assessment. It moves beyond open-ended exploration to create a feedback-rich environment where students can evaluate their progress with precision. 

In our context, this exercise takes on an added layer of depth. Many of our students aren’t aspiring filmmakers; they’re engaging with film as part of critical analysis in their coursework. By recreating a shot from a film they’re studying, students step into the mindset of the film’s creators. They grapple with the artistic and technical choices behind a scene, learning to see not just as viewers but as producers. This immersive process fosters a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the film, sharpening their skills as critics. 

Beyond its immediate focus, this exercise also builds transferable skills. Once students have learned to replicate a shot, they can extrapolate those insights to create their own work, experimenting with new compositions and creative approaches. Recreating a shot offers a quick, structured entry point into technical learning, while connecting students to the art they’re analyzing. It bridges technical mastery with critical engagement, making it both an educational and creative springboard.

### Rationale
Speaking into a mic is an exercise that seems simple but opens up layers of meaning and engagement. While we’re surrounded by microphones in everyday life, focusing on “speaking into a mic” in the Learning Lab context takes on a more deliberate, experimental frame. Picture using pod mics with headphones, watching a spectrogram visualizing your voice in real time. This setup defamiliarizes the act of speaking—something we do all the time without much thought—and turns it into a reflective and intentional process.

One rationale for speaking assignments, especially in the era of generative AI, is that they offer a break from traditional text-based work, which can sometimes come with misaligned incentives or a lack of authenticity. Speaking directly into a mic asks students to engage with their voice in a new way, emphasizing spontaneity and embodied presence. The mic itself serves as a tool of focus, an indexical pointer to the act of speaking as something special—what you might call “jazz hands speaking.”

This process of seeing one’s voice as both instrument and technology can be transformative. Think of how we’re often unaware of the uniqueness of our own voices, much like Dorian Gray was unaware of the qualities Lord Henry revealed to him. Voice is deeply personal, yet the experience of perceiving it anew—as data, as something malleable and improvable—can change how students relate to this fundamental part of themselves. Experts like Erica Bailey, who teach voice and speech, excel at facilitating these transformative encounters, but even in a technical setting, tools like spectrograms and 3D visualizations make the invisible tangible.

By examining traits like resonance, hollowness, or fullness—qualities that are impressionistic but grounded in measurable data—students begin to grasp how their voices work and how they can refine them. Layering this with experiments like comparing different microphones or analyzing famous vocal styles (think Adele vs. Billie Eilish) further bridges the gap between intuitive understanding and technical mastery. It’s about turning the familiar—your voice—into something newly discovered, empowering students to see it as a tool they can wield with skill and creativity.
