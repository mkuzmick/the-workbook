## Summary

### Outline
#### Introduction to Podcast Structure (10 minutes)

**Script:**

“Welcome, everyone! Today’s workshop is designed to prepare you for your final assignment: recording a podcast where you’ll advocate for the best literary translation as if you were members of a prize committee.

We’ll start by looking at how professional podcasts are structured. For instance, *The Daily* often begins with a hook to capture the listener’s attention, then moves into a well-organized narrative that develops the story or argument, and ends with a strong conclusion or call to action.

As you work on your podcasts, consider how you can use a similar structure. Whether you’re introducing a translation, debating its merits, or concluding with your recommendation, having a clear structure will help you effectively communicate your ideas.”

#### Rhetorical Techniques in Podcasts (15 minutes)

**Script:**

“Next, let’s explore some rhetorical techniques that can make your podcast more persuasive and engaging. A great example of this is the podcast *Translators Note*. The hosts don’t just provide information—they build an argument and draw the listener in emotionally.

To help you identify these techniques, we’re going to listen to a short, one-minute clip from the episode *"A Conversation with Valzhyna Mort"*. In this segment, she discusses how translation can be guided by music and how translating poetry becomes a form of writing itself. Pay attention to how she uses analogies and vivid descriptions to convey her ideas.

Let’s listen to the clip now.”

**[Play the clip from 5:30 to 6:30 from the episode "A Conversation with Valzhyna Mort"]**

**Post-listening Discussion:**

“Now that we’ve listened to the clip, let’s discuss what you noticed. Did the speaker use storytelling to illustrate a point? How did she introduce and develop her argument? Were there any moments where she appealed to the listener’s emotions or intellect?

These are the kinds of techniques you should consider using in your own podcast. Think about how you can weave together a compelling narrative, back it up with solid evidence, and engage your listeners throughout your recording.”

#### Recording and Reflection Activity (30 minutes)

**Part 1: Recording (15 minutes)**

**Script:**

“Now that you’ve got some ideas about structure and rhetorical techniques, it’s time to practice. Break into your groups and use the microphones to record a short discussion, about 2-3 minutes long, as if it were a segment from your final podcast. Focus on using the techniques and structures we’ve discussed. Make sure to introduce your topic clearly, build your argument logically, and finish with a strong conclusion.

You have 15 minutes to complete your recording.”

**Part 2: Transcription and Creative Reflection (15 minutes)**

**Script:**

“Great work on the recordings! Now, I’ll print out transcripts of what you’ve just recorded. Once you have your transcript, we’ll do a creative reflection activity.

You’ll each get some art supplies—markers, highlighters, sticky notes, and so on. Here’s what I want you to do with your transcript:

- **Highlight** sections where you effectively used podcast structure or rhetorical techniques.
- **Underline** areas where your argument could be stronger or more persuasive.
- **Use sticky notes** to add comments, ideas for improvement, or questions about how to enhance your segment.
- **Draw arrows or symbols** to visualize the flow of your argument or to suggest where you might rearrange points for better impact.

This hands-on activity is designed to help you critically analyze how your spoken words translate into text and how you can refine them. Afterward, we’ll share our reflections.”

#### Wrap-Up and Discussion (10 minutes)

**Script:**

“Let’s regroup and talk about what you discovered during the reflection activity. How did your spoken words come across in the transcript? Did you find areas where your structure or rhetoric could be improved?

The key takeaway today is that by thoughtfully structuring your podcast and using rhetorical techniques effectively, you can make your arguments much more compelling. Keep these strategies in mind as you work on your final project.

I’m really looking forward to hearing your final podcasts! Any last questions before we wrap up?”
