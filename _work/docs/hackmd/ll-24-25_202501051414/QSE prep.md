# QSE prep
* 12 students
* 75 minutes

## ideas to cover
* building a mental schema/buckets/structures
    * visuals can help with this
* there is always a trade off between the amount of info you choose to cover
    * and the amount you cover in a visual

## the plan
* teach something in 3 minutes (10 minutes x 2 - 20 or 30 minutes)
    * think of a concept you'd ideally teach in a course in your field
    * or would like to be better at teaching
    * prepare to teach it to a partner for 3 minutes
* then the partner repeats back what they heard
    * think about what your OBJECTIVE is when you're teaching
    * partner thinks about what they're TAKING AWAY
    * is there a question you'd like your partner to have, is there something really important that you want them to take away
    * how can you get the audience to attach to what you're saying
    * how are they attaching to a tension in what you're saying and what do they see as the "resolution" to that tension (even if you don't totally resolve the tension)
    * then switch
* some tips on visual representations
    * duarte shapes
    * what are the CONCEPTS you want to convey, the RELATIONSHIPS
    * and a quick thing about tension to resolution
* time to prep visuals (10 minutes)
* distill your 3-minute talk into a visual
    * this visual should facilitate your ability to effectively teach that simple/"most essential" concept
    * take on your partner's feedback as you craft this visual
