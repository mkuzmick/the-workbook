# ll-planning-for-20241202


## start

- system on
- push all old recordings on mini, max and hijack to archive
- record hyper g and h to the could max during events (start and stop and delete files if there's nothing good there)
- record obs on 2 mac studios to the cloud mini
- rainbow computers on with 
- dd paste in links to all notes and planning docs below
- add key light on stand and confidence monitor for main table
- if we can do 4 C200s it's not bad, with c200s for the 4-main performers/speakers for the two early events . . . can we loop through the blackmagic video assist for the cameras without monitors?  Also fine to go with mix of studio cameras and c200s, with there being a logic to how we divide up the shots (i.e. wide stuff on studio cams and 70-200s on the iso performers/speakers, with one of the c200s operated during Hebrew)


##  Music 30
[nov 20 consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_lOJU1JPWck2ATJp5RjejTmaA6f0l8uQ5gShCxmlS8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.j8bdis8oanrg)

- system on, one wide shot of table and one of the larger paper station, additional mediums of table performers if useful
- run 4th pod mic and 5th mic (sm58) into zoom at same levels as others
- record those shots and audio from mixer (on mixer as backup is fine)
- clean paper up immediately--fine to put things on table in open office space if need be and go through it to save/recycle as appropriate
- much of the equipment can stay (see next event)


## Modern Hebrew

- [link to consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ef-Sq7rKp2mBBuQYTWsmHmTjL8SOlFLdfiaM9KFtpXo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.g60n1olxzc95)
- microphones can stay set up, with all 4 matching pod mics now up on the table (leave amplification on for icebreaker but then cut signal to speakers)
- medium to mcu of each student and a shot of the whole table
- record each feed and all iso audio
    - live record 4-up of students and audio mix
    - live record me1 which can be switched with audio mix
- set up laptop with all clips to be projected to screen near table and give to professor to manage (but someone stay nearby to help if need be)
- have a 70-200 behind prof to get a couple of shots of the laptop then tilt/pan to TV and rack focus to illustrate what's happening
- clean up from this one immediately

## CompLit 207

- [nov19 notes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dcj-n1trbKVgMK55UszWpcBTQ5MeUXy0c1Tr3lRDJzA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lh6x17he5u1k) and

### outline of event
- plan
    - initial conversation Moira leads
    - at separate stations playful chat with Moira-bots to start reflections
    - everyone does the quiz/form on their own
    - scrape the sheet and process 
    - class comes back together and we try to play a micro-lecture from moira-bot together with maybe some seminar style discussion (and actual moira does this too)
    - have some of the output of the various theorists show up on projected screens
    - starting at 5pm we have food and art supplies to "materialize" the digital and conceptual stuff of the course
    - ideally each student gets a print-out
    - ideally there's a collective annotated syllabus

### notes

- dd/mw requested editor access to [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wgu9V3MRgyIhPoTr2DAq3u6DMqHqH-NO3dTkA0ADges/viewform?edit_requested=true) and create [sheet of responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVVqQjKPjSImiqttleFnv0ilSf0DyRkDWkH0DUaqFV4/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1008089836#gid=1008089836)
- 

### tasks

- test link between sheet and Airtable
- build and launch bots and media
    - eleven labs link HERE (test capacity)
    - capture bot config (and launch after wiping hijack memory)
    - workshop/rainbow bots config and methods (be sure to use larger context 50 messages+ ...and maybe throttle responses or have them triggered?)
    - have 2 computers set up in classroom
    - have a computer set up in small studio
    - set up screens and projectors for projected content
- image generation station
    - set up two mac studios and rainbow computers for live editing and image generation
    - in the early part of day, generate various options for Moira-Bot and Theorist-Bot images
- syllabus
    - copy all relevant parts of syllabus (probably initial description and week-by-week timeline) and put in [google doc HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a71gGxV-XTKuwKkmRocJyhj8KcI0lcDYHmA22Db5GrE/edit?tab=t.0) and [complit-207-syllabus-markdown-doc](/wWTcydZVQW6O89-lE6sC7w)
    - create an extremely well designed vertical strip of the syllabus to install on the white boards (ideally 8 ft long)
    - design annotation balloon in advance
    - during event print and mount annotation balloons next to vertical syllabus
- during event create buttons, block prints, paper dolls etc based on

        - inputs from mics2hijack throughout space
        - inputs from Slack Channels

            - moira-bot
