# TS280 media sourcing task 


**Prompt:**

As we prepare for the upcoming Comparative Literature workshop on AI and translation (TS280), please source ambient media (both video and audio) that will set the tone for the session. The goal is to create an immersive environment that reflects the intersection of artificial intelligence, literature, and human experience. This media will be projected and played during the workshop. 

**Guidelines:**
- Look for abstract or conceptual media that can be projected or played in the background without distracting from discussions.
- Media can include soundscapes, visual art videos, generative or glitch art, and pieces with a subtle nod to the evolution of AI and its cultural impacts.

**Posting Instructions:**
- Post in the **media-sourcing** channel on Slack.
- Start a new thread by including **TS280 (the course number)** in the initial post.
- Add the sourced media links/files in the **replies** of that thread.
    - NOTE: If you are posting from an LL computer, please include your **name** in the post for proper attribution.

**Mood/Vibe Examples:**
