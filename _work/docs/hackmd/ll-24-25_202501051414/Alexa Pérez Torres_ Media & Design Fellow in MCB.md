# Alexa Pérez Torres: Media & Design Fellow in MCB

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0860DYS0TA/alexa-re-edit-1.png?pub_secret=aba5f81edf)

Media & Design Fellows provide direct support to specific courses, helping students develop and complete multimodal assignments. MDFs also host workshops in multimodal communication, multimodal storytelling, and presentation techniques. They also provide general support to their departments by developing resources and hosting events that support multimodal scholarship.

In this report, you can read about:
* The **training with the Learning Lab** Alexa did to get ready to support projects in MCB
* The **courses** Alexa supported this term

## Learning Lab Training

During MDF orientation in August and throughout the bi-weekly fall MDF meetings, Alexa learned:
* how to **design activities, prototype assignments, and create resources** that help students in the particular courses they are supporting.
* a set of **multimodal pedagogy and instructional design best practices** and ways of connecting it to their discipline
* **the affordances of different media** and what students gain, intellectually and analytically, by engaging with those media forms

During her time at the Learning Lab, Alexa has specialized in a range of tools that have enabled her to support MCB courses and departmental projects. These include:
* **Blender**, an industry-standard and open-source tool used for 3D modeling and animation
* **microphones**, including dynamic mics, condenser mics, and cardioid mics, as a way of exploring and understanding their different audio qualities
* **digital audio workstations** (DAWs) that can be used for editing podcasts
* **AI tools** including custom GPTs and other major text and image generation tools
* **Final Cut Pro**, a video editing tool that can be used for science explainer video projects
* **Canva**, a web-based graphic design and layout tool

### OEB 50: Genetics and Genomics

In OEB 50, a genetics and genomics class led by Robin Hopkins, students make a podcast as their final assignment, combining technical skills in podcast creation with science communication techniques.  

To prepare students for this assignment, Alexa helped design and facilitate a workshop about the principles of scientific communication. Students participated in four interactive stations:  
- **An improv station** where they presented and defended a significant scientific discovery to build confidence and practice speaking into a microphone  
- **A "simplify or de-jargon" activity** where they transformed complex scientific abstracts into accessible language  
- **A "visual to verbal and verbal to visual" station**, where students described complex visuals for a partner to draw, honing their ability to communicate detailed concepts through audio alone  
- **A technical station** where they recorded and edited segments of their podcasts, learning the key moves of audio editing in GarageBand  

These activities helped students develop key skills in both communication and podcast production.  

### SCRB 111: Regeneration: Phenomena to Mechanisms  
In SCRB 111, students created explainer videos in the style of TedEd as their final project, prioritizing conceptual clarity over technical complexity.  

To help students prepare for this project, Alexa **designed a workshop** where students worked to visually communicate complex scientific concepts. During the workshop:  
- Students formed project groups by mapping their interests on a two-by-two chart with axes ranging from phenomenology to mechanisms and from "dream regeneration" to "nightmare regeneration." This mapping process allowed the professor to identify natural groupings.  
- Students worked with academic papers they had recently studied in class, selecting one section—such as methods or results—and used arts supplies and an overhead camera to present a one-minute paper prototype of their final video.  

The activity emphasized using overhead visuals and basic graphic design principles to effectively convey their research.  

In addition to this workshop, Alexa conducted **consultations** with each student group and gave them feedback as they rehearsed their presentations.  

### FYSEMR 57Z: Unlocking the Power of Immunology – From Fundamental Principles to Innovative Research Routes  
Alexa is helping Professor Nagashima **develop section-sized generative learning activities** for students to do in this spring 2025 course, as a way of helping them explore immunology in a hands-on way. These activities will deploy generative learning strategies, which use techniques like summarizing, visualizing, and concept mapping, to help students make sense of what they’re learning.

## Department Support

### Reading Scientific Papers with AI Assistance  
To support introductory students’ ability to read advanced scholarship, Alexa will **explore the range of AI tools** that can be used to help students read scientific literature. She will create a **resource** that can be shared with undergraduate courses and with the department’s faculty and graduate students.  The goal will be to find tools and develop activities that facilitate introductory students’ ability to read advanced scholarship, using AI tools that academics in the field are increasingly turning to.  

### Friday Meeting Consultations  
Alexa will be a resource for graduate students in the department, offering **consultations** as they prepare for their Friday Meeting presentations. These consultations are low-stakes ways for graduate students in the department to get Alexa’s feedback on their presentation skills, organization, and slide design.  

### 3D Protein Modeling Resource  
Continuing her project from last academic year, Alexa will continue to develop a **resource** about using open-source 3D modeling tools like Blender for protein modeling. This resource will help graduate students and faculty expand their modeling toolkits and introduce them to possible workflows for creating their own 3D assets, which are indispensable visual tools for explaining scientific processes and phenomena (including those that are otherwise invisible to the human eye). 

### Chalk Talks Workshop and Resource  
To qualify as PhD candidates, MCB graduate students do a chalk talk in front of their committee. Graduate students do forms of visual facilitation on a whiteboard and answer questions about their projects as they present. To help the department's graduate students prepare for this important milestone in their doctoral degrees, Alexa will develop and deliver a **workshop** on chalk talks that will help students learn about visual facilitation strategies (i.e., using the whiteboard to convey their research) and the improvisation required to respond effectively to participant questions. 

Learning the key moves of these presentations will help the department’s graduate students prepare for their careers as scientists, where it’s crucial to effectively communicate technical research to broader audiences who do not necessarily possess the same level of expertise.  

### Poster Templates for MCO Retreat  
Working with Renate Hellmiss, Alexa will b**uild poster templates** for the MCO Retreat. These posters can be used by participants to share their research and to learn about one another’s work, helping the department strengthen its scientific community. These posters also deploy graphic design to communicate science, demonstrating the importance of visual forms to science communication.
