# MDF Orientation Day 4: Storytelling About Our Work



This resource will help you learn how to get footage from our servers and edit that footage into a montage--a key form we use to share our work with others.

## accessing synology

### what is synology?!
When the LL team refers to "synology," we're talking about the servers that hold all of the footage we get from workshops and other events we hold in our space (as well as the shoots we do elsewhere).

This footage is an absolute goldmine of awesome moments of teaching and learning using the media and technical capacities of the LL.

We need your help to find these moments in this footage, by scrubbing through it and then taking selects and stills that we can use in our reports about all of the amazing things that our fellows and staff do!

This is a guide to getting on synology - the means of getting that footage!

### getting on synology
* get on any LL computer connected to ethernet (like the macs we often have in the LL studio)
* open Finder
* on the left-hand column, select Synology_10
    * sometimes it's connected already but if it isn't, you can log with the MDF credentials (Christine has this info for you!)
* 10_01
    * in this folder, you can go into the fellows folder (and LLUF or MDF, depending on who you are)
    * make a folder for yourself
    * store in here your stills and exports
    * but NOT massive amounts of footage, because that will crash our servers
* in the _proxy folder
    * this is where all of the proxy footage from workshops can be found, organized by year and date
    * this is where you should pull your footage from since it's a more manageable size!
    * click and drag them onto your drive
* before putting things on a drive
    * it's a good idea to just open stuff you might want in QuickTime and scrub through it to figure out if it's what you actually want
    * good things: great shots of folks learning, cool stuff under the overhead, etc.
* if you're using an LL drive
    * make sure to make a new folder with your name 
    * and probably within that folder, a folder with the project name, date, etc.

## making a montage in FCPX
One of the best ways to learn a video editing tool--and by extension some of the principles of film editing--is to create a montage of clips. A montage is essentially a sequence of video clips that are strategically and purposefully arranged, edited, titled, synced with sound, etc. Editing a montage allows you (the editor!) to reach your audience and convey to them something meaningful.

Film scholar Patrick Keating, writing about classical Hollywood films, has described films as a series of "sequential disclosures" (Keating 8). A film is essentially an arrangement of images, or clips, that ultimately come together to tell a story. In this sense, a film editor has a lot of control over what audiences take away from the film!

This idea of a sequence that discloses something to the viewer is one way to think about what your montages do. By arranging clips on a timeline in a purposeful way, you will ultimately tell the story of an event--one that happened here at the LL--in a way that could only be told through the medium of film. Consider what you want your viewer to understand about the footage as you edit it: How can you arrange footage, make cuts, create juxtapositions, and so on that tell the story of an event? 

### setting up your FCPX project

* Create a library 
    * name it ```mdforientation_firstname_YYYYMMDD```
* Create 2 Events - "Footage" and "Project"
    * Import your footage into the "Footage" folder
    * In your "Project" folder, make a new Project called "rough-cut" (or whatever you want your timeline to be called)

### scrubbing footage and getting clips

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F07K0MALFS8/in-and-out_360.gif?pub_secret=63a8127d84)
* you can scrub through your footage in the top right corner by dragging your cursor across the footage
    * you can also select different views for how you'd like to view your footage bay by clicking the icon to the right of "All Clips"
    * and you can also set how the clips appear (e.g.,how many seconds of footage you're viewing in that window) by clicking the icon that looks like a strip of film
* to start making clips, set an "in" point
    * press the letter "i"
* then set an "out" point (the end of the clip)
    * press the letter "o"
* Add the clip to the timeline
    * pressing the letter "e" adds clip to the end of the timeline
    * you can also click and drag the select manually and drag it onto your timeline

### range selected keywords

* you can add keywords to a specific moment in your clips or chunks of clips (sometimes called "clip ranges") by pressing ```command + K```, writing the keyword you want to use in the pop up window, and then selecting it
    * say I wanted to note all of the overhead camera footage - I could scrub through the footage and label all of those chunks with the keyword "overhead"
    * [more on keywords at this link](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/add-keywords-ver68416335/mac)
* once you've input a keyword, you can see it in the left-hand sidebar if you click "Footage"

### editing on the timeline
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F07JHND2SCX/screen_recording_2024-08-28_at_1.30.00_pm_360.gif?pub_secret=574bb034db)
* you can shorten and lengthen clips by hovering over the beginning or end of a clip and then clicking and dragging (in for making it shorter, out for extending it)
* you can select different tools on the left-hand side of the timeline 
    * cutting (with blade tool or ```command + B```)
* zoom in and out in the timeline to see more frames
    * press ```command +``` to see more frames
    * or ```command -``` to see fewer frames
    * **seeing more frames in the timeline is especially helpful when you're pulling stills! you can really isolate a very specific fraction of a second when everyone is smiling, laughing, etc.**
* press the space bar for playback
    * playback will start where your playhead is (the playhead is the vertical line that you can move around on your timeline and marks a specific moment)
* the magnetic timeline
    * the FCPX timeline is magnetic, meaning that when you move a clip and pop it in between, say, two other clips, the clip will automatically fit into that space
    * similarly, if you take a clip out, the surrounding clips will automatically fill in that gap/sit right next to each other in the space where the prior clip was

### audio
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F07JYDDT0NN/screen_recording_2024-08-28_at_1.57.03_pm_360.gif?pub_secret=605323955d)
* to have a better view of your audio track
    * move your playhead to the clip 
    * right click on the clip
    * select "Expand Audio"
* separating the audio track
    * move your playhead to the clip where you'd like to separate the audio
    * right click on the clip
    * select "Detach Audio"
    * you can then move the audio to another part of the clip or delete it
* adding a music bed
    * import your music
    * click and drag to add it to the timeline
    * edit it the way you would a visual clip

### adding titles
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F07JYDGLMH9/screen_shot_2024-08-28_at_2.15.21_pm.png?pub_secret=a2c69edfdf)
* click the letter T icon in the top left corner of the window
* a whole library of titles will show up
    * 'Basic Lower Third' is a nice conventional doc-style title that we use in montages pretty regularly
* click and drag the title to the timeline, placing it above the clip where you'd like it to appear
* you have total control over the duration of the title (i.e., how long it appears on screen) - just click and drag the end of the title clip to get it to your preferred length
* you can also edit the text, choose different fonts, change the font color, etc., in the rop right corner
    * usually, FCPX opens this window when you double click the title on your timeline (putting you into a kind of text edit mode)
    * otherwise you can click the Text Inspector icon, which looks like a paragraph with multiple lines

## exporting and saving fcpxml
* export fcpxml
    * file > Export XML
    * choose the file destination
    * compress the file for Slack by zipping it
    * drop it into ```#util-save-your-fcpxml```
* export mp4

    * file > Share > Apple Devices 1080p
    * when you're saving: double-check that it's exporting at 1080p by clicking "settings" (pictured above)
* send it to slack with your name esp if using one of our machines
    * you'll eventually want this in your UPDATES channel!
