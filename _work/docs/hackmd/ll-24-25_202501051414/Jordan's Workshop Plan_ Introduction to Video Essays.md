## Summary

### Outline
#### Introduction
"Today, we’re going to explore how video essays can be just as structured and intentional as traditional academic essays. Just like a written essay has an introduction that sets up the argument, video essays have an opening that does the same, but with visuals, sound, and narration working together.

We're going to watch the first minute of a video by Vox called 'Why This Chair is Everywhere.' As we watch, think about how the video sets up its argument. Pay close attention to the formal elements—like the visuals, the tone of voice, and even the pacing of information. These elements are like the parts of a machine; each one plays a specific role in creating the overall argument."

#### Unpacking the Model
*Play the first minute of the video.*

"Now that we've seen the opening, let's break it down. What do you notice about how the video starts? The video immediately poses a question—'Why is this chair everywhere?' This is similar to how you might introduce a tension in your own video essay. The video then provides some context, showing images of the chair in different settings. Notice how the visuals aren’t just decoration; they’re crucial in building the argument.

Think of the narration as the thesis statement in an academic essay. It directly tells us what to expect, guiding our understanding. The use of text on the screen adds another layer of communication, reinforcing the key points.

Each of these elements—the question, the visuals, the narration—works together like parts of a machine. Their purpose is to set up an expectation, create some tension, and prepare us for the resolution that will come as the video progresses."

#### Guiding Questions for Discussion
- "What specific visual elements stood out to you in the first minute, and how did they contribute to setting up the argument?"
- "How does the narration help in building tension or posing the central question of the video?"
- "Can you identify how the video begins to resolve the tension it creates? What clues are given in the first minute?"
- "How might you use a similar approach in the introduction of your own video essay? What question or tension could you introduce?"
