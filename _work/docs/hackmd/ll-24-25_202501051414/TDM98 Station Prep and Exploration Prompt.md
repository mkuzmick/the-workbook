## TDM98 Station Prep and Exploration Prompt

**work-sharing-channel:** #ll-project-tdm-98  
**prereqs:** interest in exploring digital performance tools and building step-by-step workflows  
**prompt:** 

This week, we’re setting up and experimenting with interactive stations for the TDM98 Junior Tutorial workshop. The main event is on Thursday (12-2:45 PM), where students will rotate through stations to create unique, multimodal performances. Even if you're not available on Thursday, you’re encouraged to explore these stations and document step-by-step workflows for each throughout the week.

### Task Options for LLUFs:

1. **Identify Key Assets**: Document assets available at the Learning Lab (e.g., projectors, cameras, cardboard for set design, grid controllers). Note how each can be used in performances or creative projects.

2. **Develop Workflow Guides**: This option is more advanced, building off of known assets. Think through workflow options for each station (listed below). Break down each tool or activity into clear steps, focusing on how to get started, what assets to use, and an engaging activity. *For example, outline how to set up audio with Logic, capture performance on the camera, then script character interactions with AI.*

3. **Compile a [TDM 98 HackMD Glossary](/zeTBOAzzRMqTRKUs8ljHkw)**: Pull together a glossary in hackMD of terms related to elements of theatre. ChatGPT definitions are fine, such as:

    * Dramaturgy is the art and practice of shaping a story's structure, themes, and character dynamics to enhance its impact on an audience. In theater and film, a dramaturg is often responsible for researching and analyzing the script, providing historical or cultural context, and helping to clarify the narrative and emotional arc of a piece. This role includes identifying the play or script's underlying themes, helping to refine dialogue, and offering insights into character motivations.  
    * Dramaturgs often work closely with directors, playwrights, and actors to ensure the story is cohesive, compelling, and aligns with the intended message. They may also aid in adapting the story for different settings, mediums, or audiences, making dramaturgy a blend of literary analysis, creative consultation, and practical guidance in storytelling.


### Stations Overview:

1. **Audio Zone**:  
   - **Tools**: Logic, GarageBand, grid controllers  
   - **Task**: Explore how audio can enhance live or recorded performances. Ideas to get you started:
      - Layer sounds or cues to create a dynamic environment.
      - Experiment with loops, effects, or real-time audio adjustments.

2. **Camera & Projection Zone**:  
   - **Tools**: Cameras, projectors, fabrics  
   - **Task**: Use cameras and projectors to capture and project live visuals. Ideas to get you started:
      - Create feedback loops by projecting live images onto different surfaces.
      - Experiment with performance staging in front of a camera or for projection onto fabrics.

3. **Set Design Zone**:  
   - **Tools**: Green screen, cardboard, various set materials  
   - **Task**: Design miniature sets with available materials. Ideas to get you started:
      - gather materials needed (like cardboard)
      - prototype a mini set with cardboard or other materials.
      - Experiment with using the green screen to integrate actors into custom backgrounds.

4. **AI & Character Generation Zone**:  
   - **Tools**: ChatGPT, Eleven Labs 
   - **Task**: Think through the steps you would take to build characters or script ideas with AI tools, focusing on adding depth and maintaining human agency.
   - **Note on Human Agency**: When developing with AI, focus on maintaining as much human input and decision-making as possible. Look for ways to make AI contributions “assistive” rather than doing the work independently.
