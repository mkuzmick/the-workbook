# Multiplane Animation Breakdowns

Breaking an animation down into its parts is 70% about choosing the right shot, 10% visual trickery, 10% actual animating, and 10% clever photoshopping.

## What to look for 

### Without Motion Cycles

The right shot is going to have a couple criteria: 
* A distinct foreground, middle, and background
* Relatively little to no changing perspective
* Its especially attainable if the subject isn't animated with a motion cycle, but just moving across the screen. 
* This is most achievable if you can imagine that the different planes of the animation can be printed out and moved around on a table without losing the intention of the shot. 

This one from Castle in the Sky is just about perfect. There is no isolated motion cycles, so it can be done entirely by:

* [isolating each frame in which each island shows the most of itself, and photoshop out that island](https://youtu.be/MLIbKcPX244)
* isolate the frame in which you can see the most out of the background, mask out each island, and [then use Generative Fill to fill the gaps in the background.](https://youtu.be/Sp6K3qpVFO0)
* finally, stick it all back together in AE and add your multiplane animation.

### With Motion Cycles

This Bambi shot is a great example of a shot that is easily roto-able. Most specifically, there's nothing passing in front of the characters, and the characters aren't entering/leaving the frame. 

![A shot from Bambi](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F073PA4TXRS/bambi.gif?pub_secret=afac4da733)

It will require 
* [rotobrushing out Bambi and the bunny together(because the bunny passes in front of Bambi).](https://youtu.be/Tr1YIX_SZW4)  
* And then taking ~7 stills(or however many it takes to get all the background plates), and then stitch them all together and remove the subjects/fill in the empty spots.

From there, you have all the parts to stick it all back together again.

### When Close-enough Beats Perfect

![A shot from a Ghibli film that pans down from the sky to two characters standing on a ledge, looking out](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0749KJ6A48/ghibli.gif?pub_secret=f085d54d2d)

This one is slightly more difficult, due to the subject's dress, flapping in the breeze. One way to contend with this would be:
* to rotobrush out the ~6-10 frames of the dress flapping while in full view, before the companion looks up at the girl. And then boomerang it. The resulting animation would have everything except that head turn. 
    * for a far simpler variation, you might be able to get away with just masking out a still version of the characters and execute your multiplane explosion before the camera tilts down far enough for it to matter
* then follow the same steps as the Castle in the Sky animation

Here are two examples, the first has the characters rotoscoped out so that their motion cycles are retained:

![an animation from a Ghibli film that expands out to show the various layers, where the characters are animated](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F073RU0L3MK/ghibli-motion-cycle.gif?pub_secret=54f45c6932)

The second uses just still images of the characters: 

![an animation from a Ghibli film that expands out to show the various layers, where the characters are still](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F073RU021C5/ghibli-still-characters.gif?pub_secret=053ee18966)

You'll probably notice that the extra work of rotoscoping out the characters is largely made ineffective by the exploding/zooming effect. So arguably, it wasn't all that useful to go through the extra labor. 

## A few more examples of viable shots

This one is great because the majority of both characters are in the shot, not entering/leaving again. They also don't intersect each other, so they can be easily separated into layers. 

![a shot from the Lion King](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F073LRR0B3L/lion-king.gif?pub_secret=e0a2d749f6)

This one is a bit more of a candidate for the "visual trickery" approach. Since we don't see all of the Iron Giant throughout the shot, it would be tricky to pull it out entirely. But there are plenty of images of the robot standing, which can then be substituted with a bit of color correction to be that middle-ground layer.
