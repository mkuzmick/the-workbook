# Language Learning GPT

ChatGPT can serve as an advanced voice-based language tutor, designed to provide personalized conversational language practice with dynamic feedback. It helps learners improve their speaking, listening, and comprehension skills by simulating natural dialogue with the added benefits of tailored pedagogical support. ChatGPT can adapt in real-time to the user's needs, offering an interactive and flexible learning experience.

This document will describe the steps for setting up an advanced voice GPT to best cater to these pedagogical aims.

### Setting up the interface
First, open up a new ChatGPT log with either a tablet or a mobile phone. *Note*: This feature will not work on computers. Click on the circular button on the very right side of the chat interface.

After clicking the button, the advanced voice assistant will load. You will know the loading is successful if the circle in the middle takes on this blue hue. Feel free to mute yourself at any point by using the button in the bottom left of the screen, and if you would like to change the style of the computer's voice.

Now, you are ready to give your first prompt via voice: **I am a student learning [language], with a level of [number from 1-10 rating fluency] looking to speak about [topic]. Please track what I say to assess my [grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, etc.] after our conversation.**

This initial prompt will start the process of a language learning GPT. As the conversation goes on, here are some tips to fine-tune the voice assistant.

#### Adjusting the Speed of Dialogue
Recognizing that language learners have varying levels of fluency, the GPT can slow down or speed up the pace of the conversation upon request.
- For beginners, the GPT can slow its speech, providing clear articulation and more time for the user to process what’s being said.
- For advanced learners, it can **increase the pace** to mimic real-world conversations, helping learners develop faster comprehension and response times.

This customization helps learners practice at a pace that’s both comfortable and challenging, ensuring they remain engaged and motivated.

#### Contextual Advice and Cultural Notes
In addition to language mechanics, the GPT can provide **cultural insights** and **contextual advice** based on the conversation topic. For instance, if the conversation involves social scenarios, the GPT can offer advice on **politeness** or **cultural norms** relevant to the language:
- It might explain why a certain phrase is more formal or informal in context, helping learners gain not just linguistic knowledge but also **cultural competence** in the language.
