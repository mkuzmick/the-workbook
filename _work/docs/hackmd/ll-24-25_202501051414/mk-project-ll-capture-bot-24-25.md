# mk-project-ll-capture-bot-24-25


## to do

- need better ways of organizing hijack files after recording
- need to stitch together with iso timecoded files from prores recorder


## workflow

- record
    - segmented Audio Hijack recordings
    - OBS
    - ME1-4
    - 4K-4-source-Multiviews
- hijack script
    - rename and move files on rename
    - into different buckets at that stage or no?
    - maybe do not open window going forward
- watcher function
    - transcribe
    - save transcript
    - save related image
    - save file? (all in folder?)
- process
    - get simple transcript
    - word level transcript
    - segment level transcript
    - try to save clock-time estimate
    - 
- send results to Slack and Airtable
- post-processing
    - need goal oriented editorial vision
    - and then recursively return to this with new data
    - and then be storing accumulation of summaries as we go
    - reconcile the various timecodes?
        - slack message time
        - seconds in to audio file
        - audio file creation
        - rename operation in hijack (could have milliseconds but do these really matter?)
        - timecode in video files
        - sources of truth
            - a8k
            - mac pro clock
            - time.gov
        -
