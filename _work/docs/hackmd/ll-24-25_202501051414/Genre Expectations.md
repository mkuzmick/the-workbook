# Genre Expectations for Final Assignments

This resource explores some of the key genre conventions of the final project options in GENED 1122: Social Responsibilities of Higher Education. 

## audio/visual assignments
Audio and visual assignments, like podcasts and short documentary films, share certain capacities. Both are well-suited for:
* projects where interviews have been conducted and the first-hand voice/perspective of the interview subject is desirable
* projects where you want to tell a story (about a particular social issue, about your experience coming to explore that issue, etc.)
* projects where some element of personal experience informs the analysis
* projects that seek to take a more academic approach, bringing in many experts on a given topic or integrating many different types of sources to make a well-informed claim (similar to an essay)
* projects where the unfolding of a particular temporal sequence is crucial to the way that story is told (i.e., the argument unfolds in time and is ideally experienced in a sequence determined by the maker)
* projects that are addressed to a public or otherwise broad audience of non-specialists


Each of these forms has unique affordances, too.

### podcast
Podcasts transform an argument into an oral form and can address a broad audience, especially if they take a more informal, conversational style. The podcast is a unique way to tell stories and is frequently superior to other modes at making these stories intimate, moving, understandable-to-a-lay-audience, and dramatic, to name only a few characteristics. Podcasts can integrate a range of sounds to develop an immersive sonic experience for the listener, leading them through the story by way of different types of sounds (e.g., voiceover, sound effects, ethnographic sounds, music) and different audio qualities.

### short documentary
Documentaries have many advantages for storytelling, including that they can integrate many perspectives (especially if interviews with different "experts" or other subjects are incorporated), and they develop the narrative through both visual and aural channels. Documentaries develop a rich visual tapestry to develop the context from which the story can emerge. Using techniques like montage, documentary can also quickly and efficiently provide ample visual "data" to support a particular claim (i.e., if you want to show the ubiquity of something, you can find many, many visual examples to underscore your claim that this is, in fact, ubiquitous). Voiceover also keeps the narrator present throughout the film, serving as a more personal guide through the story than a traditional academic essay might. Documentaries can also incorporate many types of images, including infographics, still images, animations, and figures.

## written assignments
Written assignments, such as policy papers and long-form essays, are conventional in higher education. You've likely written texts similar to them for many courses. Let's still take a moment to unpack what these forms can do. Considered together, they both tend to:
* recommend a particular course of action or "next steps" or otherwise look ahead to the next phase of research and analysis
* summarize and analyze existing debates around a given topic, as a way to demonstrate proficiency and to give credence to the ultimate position that you take
* be addressed to other experts in a particular domain
* take a more academic approach (i.e., do not tend to integrate significant anecdotal perspective)
* present the argument "all at once" to the reader--whereas podcasts and video essays unfold in time, written texts like policy papers and essays (even though they proceed linearly) present their findings in one large chunk that the reader can skip around.
