# xtine-biocard-project-description

Presenting data alongside relevant media is a fundamental skill that students working in any multimodal form need to have. A bio card, which integrates text, images/video, maybe animations, and other graphics, uses visuals to contextualize information in much the same way that, say, a video essay or infographic might. 

By styling a bio card using CSS for the web, we're taking this form into the digital realm as a way of making it: 
* scalable
* customizable to the finest/most specific points
* connected to capacities (e.g., basic CSS, markdown, etc.) that today's students are often expected to know. 

Meanwhile, by emphasizing the aesthetic choices that inform the design of the bio card (including font, color combinations, etc.), this project emphasizes the cultivation of taste as a (human) practice that we don't want to outsource to AI or other digital tools, even as these same tools can be used to assist in the production process or with coding (especially for beginners, like many of the students in COMPLIT280X). This project will thus also involve exploring the conventions of graphic design and its empirical/mathematical realization through code.
