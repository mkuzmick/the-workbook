## notes
* a pinteresting work channel (moodboard? lookbook? etc.)
* split up img2md into work channels for types of images
* great to have some directory/guide of what each channel gets (if it's not obvious)
* utility channel for saving audio files
    * modal that pops up where you have to fill in info about the reflection - users that were speaking, channel that indicated the project
