# AMST201 Intro Workshop

## Summary
AMST201 "Themes in American Studies" is a course taught for PhD students in American Studies, and this year Women and Gender Studies as well. In the past, the course has recieved feedback that students in AMST are looking for more material that is attentive to issues of race/gender and more practice with developing skills that will be valuable to their careers as historians. This semester, Professor Robert Reid-Pharr is hoping to incorporate this feedback in his iteration of the course "Gender and the Archive."

The LL is supporting AMST201 students as they prepare presentations for an "academic conference of the future."

## Our pitch to AMST201:
**9/21/21:** an initial meeting that introduces them to the Learning Lab, the support we provide to faculty and grads doing public talks like Harvard Horizons, and the specific support we hope to provide them this term. Then we’ll run them through a very quick oral/visual presentation exercise in front of our video cameras to give them a taste of what awaits them.
**11/2/21:** students return to the Learning Lab to practice oral presentation skills, to discuss the visual elements of their presentations, and to think a bit about their conference’s public presence (the website, mainly, but optionally other elements such as social feeds or posters?)
between 11/2/21 and 11/16/21: the Bok Staff will be available during our open studio time to offer help with the visual elements of the students’ talks and website.
**11/16/21 and 11/23/21:** in the current plan, the students will perform their final presentations in front of our video cameras and take questions from the audience. If for any reason it makes more sense for us to record the presentations in advance, we can do that too--just let us know. For Harvard Horizons this year we posted the talks a week before the event, then the speakers each gave a 1-minute “elevator pitch” version of their talk and answered questions.
