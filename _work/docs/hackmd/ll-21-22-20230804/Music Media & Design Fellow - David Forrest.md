# Music Media & Design Fellow - David Forrest
Media & Design Fellow Fall 2021 Update


### Fall Projects


* **GENED 1080: How Music Works: Engineering in the Acoustical World Student Project Archive & Gallery**: David has been building an Airtable database of all of the acoustic, electronic, and final projects GENED 1080 students have made from 2018 - 2021. David's vision for this database is to make it sharable so that current and future students can refer to it as they develop their own projects. Additionally, David will analyze the data in order to identify student projects to feature. Showcasing student work in this manner is an effective way to encourage current students to be ambitious in their approach to project design and implementation. It's also a great way to celebrate student achievement in the course. So far, David has compiled the necessary assets and converted files so that Airtable will recognize them. David also modified the assignments so that they presented well in gallery mode (e.g., giving them catchy titles, composing gallery descriptions, uploading gallery photos from the students, etc.). 

* **GENED 1080 Fest Media Capture and Editing**: During the fall 2021 term, GENED 1080 hosted a festival that showcases student projects. Working with the LL team, David captured the event on film. Using this footage, David intends to create an updated promotional reel for GENED 1080 Fest. Depending on the quality of the interviews conducted on camera during 1080 Fest, David might also produce an interview compilation.

* **Shapes Videos**: David has been developing a beginner music learning method that leads learners through a series of lesson videos on a website. This site is synced to a database with a large collection of YouTube music videos that learners can play along with. These videos are the central instructional tool on this website.

* **Shapes Database and Website**: An ongoing project, this site will include, in addition to the videos detailed above, web instruments and other tools that allow learners to play and practice music. In the process of creating this multimodal, interactive site, David has developed methods for capturing Zoom music lessons and using these lessons as a space to prototype and test lesson plans and learning materials. David also outlined a sequence of lessons, arranging them as a path on a graphical map. 

### Spring Proposal
David will continue to work on the GENED 1080 Student Project Archive & Gallery, including adding any remaining student projects and creating an Airtable form that will allow students to add their projects in the future. David will also make the Shapes Videos and develop the Shapes Database and Website. For the Shapes Website, David will develop the front-end.
