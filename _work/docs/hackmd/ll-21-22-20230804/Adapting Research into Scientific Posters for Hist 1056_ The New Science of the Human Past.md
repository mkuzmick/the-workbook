During the fall 2021 semester, Media & Design Fellow Claire Adams hosted a Scientific Poster Workshop for Professor Michael McCormick's course, "The New Science of the Human Past: Case Studies at the Cutting Edge." Instead of doing a final paper project, students in this course create scientific posters of the sort you'd find at an academic conference. Integrating visual communication into the academic research process, this exerise encouraged students to think about the visual representation of research in a manner that addresses the needs and expectations of an imagined academic audience. Making these scientific posters also requires students to consolidate their research and to present it in a concise and easily readable manner.
