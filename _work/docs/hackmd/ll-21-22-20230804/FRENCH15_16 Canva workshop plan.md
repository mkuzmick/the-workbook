# FRENCH15/16 Canva workshop plan

**From Nicole:**
In our last meeting, you mentioned that we could reserve the Bok Center space (and accompanying classroom) for a Canva intro workshop. I was hoping to do this workshop on Tuesday, February 1st between 9-10:15am. The students have a quiz so I thought it would be great to reserve the smaller classroom from 9-9:30am. Then, we could do the Canva portfolio workshop (and students could record their oral introductions on Canva) between 9:30-10:15am. What do you think? Would this be feasible?

### Plan
9-9:30am: Quiz in Classroom
