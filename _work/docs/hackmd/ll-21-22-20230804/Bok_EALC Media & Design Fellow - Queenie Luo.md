Throughout the spring term, Queenie developed [the China Biographical Database](https://webpage-test-in-s3-bucket-01.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo/index.html) for Professor Peter Bol's courses, **CHNSHIS 142: Cultural History of the Late Ming and Early Qing** and **GENED 1136: Power and Civilization: China**. This site allows students to plug in the names of figures studied in the course and then see visualizations of family trees and relations. 

**Support of GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory**

During the fall term, Queenie supported Professor Michael Puett's course GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory. As an MDF, Queenie expanded GENED 1091's course capacities by:
* creating a database of reading materials for students in the course
* creating textual visualizations that help students to visually grasp key terms and concepts  
* designing and launching an interactive [course website](https://gened-1091.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)
* organizing and hosting multimedia workshops for GENED 1091 students at the Learning Lab
* editing presentors' footage from the workshop
* creating presentors' bio and profile pages for the course website
* hosting weekly office hours for students

**Timeline and Map Projects**
In addition to the textual analysis visualizations and tools pictured above, Queenie has created visual materials that allow students to explore contextual and background information about the course topic. For example, Queenie is creating a timeline and map to illustrate some of the major historical events of early China. These visuals will help students deepen their understanding of how and why certain philosophical ideas emerge in particular political environments.

**Course Website for GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory**
Below is an image from the website Queenie has been developing for GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory. This website hosts students' creative projects, providing an intentory of examples for GENED 1091 students to explore as they develop their own final projects in the course.

Below is an image of the website's homepage.

Queenie also designed a mobile layout for this website so that users can access the website from their phones.

On the sub-page below, students can watch a video of a former student's creative dance project. Having access to this inventory of former projects helps current students develop their final projects.

In addition, Queenie also incorporated introductory videos and timeline on this site to provide students with some background knowledge to better understand the course materials.

**Multimedia Workshops at the Learning Lab**
Queenie also hosted a multimedia workshop for Professor Michael Puett's GENED 1091 course, bringing students into the Learning Lab to learn about some of the tools they could use in their final creative projects. Stations were set up where students could explore 2D illustration (both virtual and digital), 3D modeling (both virtual and digital), capturing and staging performance, and video editing.
