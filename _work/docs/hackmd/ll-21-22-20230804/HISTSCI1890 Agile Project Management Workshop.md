Great questions!

Before getting to them, I'd like to ask about timing. Since there are about 46 students (people keep adding and dropping), we talked about having half of them come at a time, while I do something with the other half in our usual classroom. Would it make sense for each section to spend 1hr or 1.25hr, with 20 minutes changeover + break? Would that keep you all too late? If there was another room at 50 Church st, we could cut down on travel time....

Now the questions:

My overall goal is for students to understand the iterative development cycle of agile (in contrast to the linear "waterfall" process). Something like this diagram:

If I'd sum it up, it would be something like 1) start with a big idea, 2) find the smallest part that would be worth making and sharing (working prototype, minimum viable product), 3) make it, 4) share it with users, 5) revise plan, 6) identify smallest worthwhile next step. I have little interest in having them learn the agile jargon.

I'd like the students to use this methodology for the two class projects (creating a wiki and the utopia project). I'm hoping to also talk about how cooperation works differently in this model than it does in a waterfall model, but I see that as secondary to having the experience of working this way.

I'd love for your workshop to step them through that process in some mini form. It seems like the two steps that might be the hardest to get would be coming up with an MVP idea and adapting the idea based on feedback.

For reading, I've asked them to read this short medium article that highlights the connections between agile and feminist counter-culture movements. The focus there is more on the teamwork aspects of the methodology. I'm also hoping that it will help folks who might not be inclined to look favorably at something popular in Silicon Valley, see the underlying concepts.

I was figuring this would be something we'd discuss outside the workshop, but if you all see a way to work it, that would be a bonus.

Does this all seem feasible?

Thanks!
