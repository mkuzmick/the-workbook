From Jie:
Visual Effects / Animation - these might be two different things or they can be combined.  When students had to be sent home in spring 2020, several had themselves play several different characters, such as this one:

Another team made very cool use of greenscreen to tell a fairy tale:

There was also a Zoombombing horror film:

And a 1-min animation

Once a student also applied some kind of special effect to a documentary film to make it look as if itâ€™s animated. I forgot to ask her what program she used, but it certainly created a very interesting final product.
