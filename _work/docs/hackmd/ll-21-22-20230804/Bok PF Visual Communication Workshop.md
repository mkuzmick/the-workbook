## notes from the instructor
### 3/17/22 check in: 
This is their unit on communication: thinking about how you communicate yourself, and also thinking about how it plays out in the classroom. Erika Bailey visited last week. 

Pamela would like the session to be along the lines of what Marlon has done in the past. The topic is visual communication. Using the mayer principle of design article; do the steve jobs ipad presentation is communicating one thing; etc. 

The PF capstone will be on zoom. They still have to design some sort of visual thing to share in the virtual session and also to put in the [PF Gallery](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/pedagogy-fellows-capstone-gallery). Marlon asked if Pamela and Rebecca had favorites that he could show and discuss the moves etc. Using some examples that have worked particularly well and unpack what is good about them.

Could have the PFs draw an image on a card that represents their PF project. A few could share their images on the overhead.

Anything they could make to publicize their work or share what they are doing with their departments? They would be interested in how to make it professional and accessible.

The group this year has tended to be more serious/reserved/sensitive. There is one person who needs to be seated.

20-25 PFs
12 MDFs
Nametags? Buttons??

    - posters, slides, websites, etc.
