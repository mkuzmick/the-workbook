# prototype-comic-book-spread

## the goal: 
Produce a two page spread as an example of something we can either imagine  many students doing as an assignment/activity or something we can imagine integrating into our media and story-production workflow. As you work, document your process and produce a tutorial or guide for future students on creating spreads using the wide variety of tools you can use for this purpose.

For more background on this project, read our [Comic Book Spreads Project Doc](/D27SUVILRPiuLeeAv0OD7Q)

*Estimated time to complete: 1.5-5 hours. Must be completed by 20220128.*

**1.** **Find Models.** *Try to spend between 10 min to an hour on this step.* Check out the [illustrating-ideas-slack channel](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02K4FF2BC3) for inspiration and ideas. Post anything you come across in your own searching too! 

**2.** **Choose your content.** *Try to spend between 10 to 30 min on this step.* We are looking for examples from a wide array of domains such as (but not limited to):

* a close reading of another graphic novel
* a close reading of a film


**3.** **Choose your tool(s) and techniques.** *Try to spend between 10 to 30 min on this step.* We want examples using a wide variety of tools and workflows (and tutorials/walkthroughs for these tools and workflows), so choose a tool you are excited about! For ideas, check out the TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES SECTION in the [Comic Book Spreads Project Doc](/D27SUVILRPiuLeeAv0OD7Q)!
