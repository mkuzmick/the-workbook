From Jie:
Audio - this may or may not work well as a workshop, but often students have a lot of trouble recording dialogues that are perfectly understandable, especially if the recording takes place outdoors.  If they didn’t check out special equipment, can we still give them some tips on more effective audio capture with phone cameras?  Apart from audio capture, there is also audio editing.  An early creative assignment option is to add a benshi (voiceover) narration to a silent film—is there an easy program for them to do that?  Adding sound (be it narration, music, or sound effects) to a silent film would also work well.  For the creation of film trailers, students often download the same two or three pieces of film trailer music, so if there is an audio archive that they can use of various film music and sound effects (such as kungfu punching sounds) that would be very useful.
