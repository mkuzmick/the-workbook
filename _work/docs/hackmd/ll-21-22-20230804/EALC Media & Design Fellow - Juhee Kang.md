# EALC Media & Design Fellow - Juhee Kang


### Projects

**Support of GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Political and Ethical Theory**
As an MDF at the Learning Lab, Juhee has taken on a wide range of projects that support teaching and learning in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. Juhee consistently takes an innovative, hands-on approach to her work at the LL, including hosting students from Professor Michael Puett's GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Political and Ethical Theory course as they prepare for their final projects. At this multimedia workshop, Juhee brought students into the Learning Lab to learn about some of the tools students could use in their final creative projects. Stations were set up where students could explore 2D illustration (both virtual and digital), 3D modeling (both virtual and digital), capturing and staging performance, and video editing.

Juhee's other projects include:

* Creating a **GENED1091 Classical Chinese Political and Ethical Theory Teaching Database**. Juhee is creating a web-based repository of GENED1091 teaching materials. So far, Juhee's work for this project has involved:
    * Collecting teaching plans and classroom activities that have been implemented during the past five or so years
    * Setting up a streamlined instruction for both head TFs and TFs so that they can contribute to the database
    * Creating templates and other documents that facilitate future collection of pedagogical materials (e.g., student consent forms that allow use of student essays and creative projects for teacher training purposes)
    * Building a web-based site holding all the above documents and files (a model for Juhee in creating this site is the [GovTeaches toolkit](https://govteaches.fas.harvard.edu/)). 
    
* Juhee is also collaborating with Professor Si Nae Park on the **"Maps (broadly construed) in Humanities" Database/Gallery**. As part of this project, Juhee is:
    *  Collecting maps used and created by scholars in the humanities
    *  Analyzing the range of their definitions, utilities, and scopes
    *  Building a reference site for maps that provides not only the maps themselves but also legends specific to each departmental usage. Juhee wants to add information about what kind of technical skills may be required to make something comparable to this reference site.

* Juhee has also provided miscellaneous technological and bibliographic assistance for faculties in EALC and History of Science:
    * Juhee assisted Professor Gabriela Soto Laveaga's **HISTSCI1480 Food, Science, and the Invention of Global Hunger** course. Juhee is developing a virtual gallery based on the activities of this course.
    * Juhee consulted with Dr. Dave Unger about the possibility of using a live syllabus for his spring term course and brainstorming how to make the in-class dynamic less top-down. 
    * For Dr. Liv Grjebine's class, Juhee demonstrated where students can find bibliographic assistance and online resource tips.

* For Professor Kuriyama, Juhee developed a web-based essay assignment using a tool called Shorthand. This tool allows students to annotate, highlight, and otherwise visually foreground certain components of a visual source. Students can also use text to annotate in Shorthand, culminating in a multimodal web-based essay. This project supported **EASTD 170 course: Medicine and the Self in China and the West**.
