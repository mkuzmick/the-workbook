# MDF MEETING 20210909

## WELCOME!

Hi all! It's great to see you again!

Today we want to welcome you to the Learning Lab (virtually or in person!), introduce you to the staff who's here to support you, and make sure that you grasp all the systems we'll be using to help you out, and the one or two little things we'll be requiring of you as MDFs this year.

- **Katie** is going to walk you through some of the digital spaces you'll be working in.
- **Casey** is going to walk you through the physical spaces you'll be working in and describing the tools you'll find there.
- **Sophie** is going to say a word or two about who the other big group of fellows are (the Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows, or LLUFs)
- then we're going to hand it over to **Jordan**, who is going to launch the Friday meeting series with a bit of showing, telling, teaching and learning

As we've said a number of times this year, we're here to support you as you complete your projects for your clients. And collaboration is a big part of how we'll be able to support you (and how you'll be able to support each other). We try to keep formal requirements to a minimum because we trust you to do amazing work on your projects in your departments, but we do ask that you attend two meetings each week:

1. the **Friday 10:30-11:45 meeting**, during which 
    - you'll share some of what you're discovering & building as you work on your projects (the **"show and tell"** segment of the meeting)
    - you'll teach us some of the skills you are developing and learn some of the skills others are developing (the **"teach and learn"** segment of the meeting) 
2. **a "Lab" meeting** during which you'll definitely so some showing & telling and teaching & learning, but you will also add **"building & supporting"**, because as the term goes on Labs will make things together and offer office hours and open studio time to courses that we support.  


At the beginning of the year, our staff and past fellows might do a little more of showing, telling, teaching and learning as you all get your projects off the ground, but the intention, ultimately, is for all of you to both share examples of what you are discovering AND to teach us all some of the skills you are developing.

The Labs are still being determined, but so far it's looking as though there is interest in
* **AVLab**, which will be devoted to all the ways of recording and editing audiovisual material. This group will get comfortable with cameras, lights, microphones, Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere, Garageband or Audacity, and much more. We'll pool our talents to support the many many workshops and office hours we'll devote to podcasting and filmmaking projects.
* **theatreLab**, which will devote itself to devising immersive, interactive experiences and performances in the LL Studio. This will include everything from basic performance tips for students giving oral presentations to thinking of our workshops themselves as bits if interactive, immersive theatre akin to _Sleep No More_
* **codeLab**, which will help out beginning coders, but also work on more advanced projects, especially in the data-visualization space
* **graphicalAbstractLab** or **illustrationLab** will exist at the intersection of drawing, graphic design, infographics, and science communication
* **mapLab** which will work on both the basic visual grammar of maps and graphic representation AND begin to explore the world of GIS
* **storyLab** will work on creating multimodal essays of various sorts that report on the work of the Learning Lab (and all of you!)
* and many more


## TODAY'S SHOWING & TELLING & TEACHING & LEARNING

Today, Jordan is going to teach us all to use a really cool tool called [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), and as she does so she'll be doing a little "show and tell" about a cool thing that happened in a workshop we collaborated on this week. 

We'll deposit notes on her work right here in this doc.
