# HISTSCI1932

## Background
#### Course description
In this project-based class, small teams of students will create interactive, web-based, multi-modal pieces that share research from the history of science with a general audience. The projects will be part of a website redesign for the Department of the History of Science and will be featured on the new site. We will be inspired by cutting edge work in online exhibits, digital publishing, digital humanities, interactive historical fiction, and more. Our work will be grounded in techniques of public history, science communication, and design thinking. Students will learn the skills needed to research, plan, and build projects of their own design. No prior technical knowledge is needed.
