# Show-Your Work!

This Spring, we'll be doing an LL Visual Storytelling Project. This project will take place in **two new Slack channels**, which you'll be added to:
* [show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C)
* [show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)

In **show-your-work**, everyone will regularly post images that document their work(s) in progress. Ideally, these images will visually represent the experience of developing and completing a mission, prototype, or other project. Images that you could post to this channel might include:
* an image of a model for your project/prototype
* a picture you took of a text you're reading as part of your planning/research
* pictures of your notes, drawings, imaginings, inspirations
* a picture of something you made - think of this as a step you took toward completing your project/prototype
* an image that captures some experiential aspect of your work process (i.e., a picture of a place you're in, a picture of you at work or making something cool!)

**Plan to post in show-your-work regularly, at least a couple times a week but ideally every time you're working on something** (LL staff will try to post at least once a day, for example). *The more visuals, the better!* Think of these images as capturing your "shifts" at the LL. You can caption your images with one sentence (or even just a few words), if you think some context is necessary for all of us to understand the image. But otherwise, just post images! 

Please note that anything you post in show-your-work will be public, and this is the goal! When you post an image in this channel, it will automatically generate a Markdown link for you, which you can then use to make HackMD docs about your projects and how you approached them. Making these how-to docs is an important way for us to learn from each other and for us to tell stories about the awesome work we do.

The **show-and-tell** channel is where we'll explain our work in a bit more detail. The plan for this channel is to:
* Post an image of your work (ideally something you've posted already in the show-your-work channel)
* Write a short paragraph (i.e., 3-4 sentences) explaining **why** you did what you did at this stage in the project and **how** you did it.

Think of what you post in the show-and-tell channel as a very short blog post of sorts, comprising both image and text. Aim to do one "show-and-tell" post per week.
