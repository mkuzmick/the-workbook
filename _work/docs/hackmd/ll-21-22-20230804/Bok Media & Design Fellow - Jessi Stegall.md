# Bok Media & Design Fellow - Jessi Stegall
Media & Design Fellow Fall 2021 Update


### Fall Projects
This semester, Jessi has developed and facilitated Theatre Lab, comprising a group of Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows and Learning Lab staff. Theatre Lab focuses on the use of space, gesture, and other performance techniques in teaching and learning environments, such as classrooms. 

Jessi has also led **workshops in podcasting** for Harvard courses, including **French 30** and **French 40**. Jessi led students through vocal warm-ups, helping students use different microphones to experiment with sound quality. Students were asked to compare and contrast the sound produced by each microphone, experimenting with tone, pitch, and speed.

Jessi assisted in developing an activity for **Expos 20: From Homer to Jay-Z: Craft and Complexity in Verbal Art and Oral Traditions**, using the Learning Lab's PA system and beat-looping to instruct students in the tension/resolution structure of academic arguments.

Jessi has organized workshops and compiled instructional resources that can be readily adapted for courses in a range of fields and disciplines, including:

* [A multimedia overivew of Erika Bailey's (American Repertory Theater and Lecturer on Theater, Dance & Media) Theater in the Classroom lecture](/@theatre-lab/r1TuDnqWF)
* [A guide to Immersive Theatre Structures](/@theatre-lab/HJpyB40zt)
* [On Gesture: Guide & Activities](/@theatre-lab/Hk42NtyXK) 
* [Learning Lab Scenarios Jar](/@llufs/ryn27IsVK)
* [Leading Vocal Production Guide](/@theatre-lab/Hy5J9gYNt)
* [Vocal Production & Microphones](/@theatre-lab/H1PfXSzEt)
* [Theatrical Blocking for Table Scapes](/@theatre-lab/SkCXJqwXY)
* ["Moves of Immersion" Study & "Moves of Immersion" Workshop](/@theatre-lab/Bkw_Sk1DF)


Jessi also has some in-progress projects, which she will continue protoyping in this semester and next. 

* [Collaborative Scriptwriting](/@theatre-lab/r1iN07CfY)
* [Theatre & Masks](/@theatre-lab/HkEAk3kQt)
* [Developing Presence](/@theatre-lab/SJ2smNRfY)
* [Performing an Academic Paper](/@theatre-lab/Skw3ZbuvY)


### Spring Proposal
Jessi is working on a guidebook that aggregates the resources she has developed throughout the semester. This guidebook or "designed process book" intends to bring theatre tools into learning environments and teaching practices. Each entry will overview a specific theatrical technique or theory and include an exercise that encourages readers to implement this concept in the classroom.
