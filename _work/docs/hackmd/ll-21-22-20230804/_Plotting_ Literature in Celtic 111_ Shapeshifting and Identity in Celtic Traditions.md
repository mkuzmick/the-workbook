# "Plotting" Literature in Celtic 111: Shapeshifting and Identity in Celtic Traditions

Media & Design Fellow Elizabeth Gipson developed a tutorial and demonstration in Storymaps JS for students enrolled in Shapeshifting and Identity in Celtic Traditions. Using this tool, students create geotags that plot the locations mentioned in literary texts they're reading in the course. Storymaps further allows students to pair an image and some text with a given plot on the map.
