# Shapes Database and Website

An ongoing project, this site will include, videos for beginnger music learners (produced by MDF David Forrest), web instruments and other tools that allow learners to play and practice music. In the process of creating this multimodal, interactive site, MDF David has developed methods for capturing Zoom music lessons and using these lessons as a space to prototype and test lesson plans and learning materials. David also outlined a sequence of lessons, arranging them as a path on a graphical map.
