# GENED1091 Classical Chinese Political and Ethical Theory Teaching Database

Media & Design Fellow Juhee Kang is creating a web-based repository of GENED1091 teaching materials. So far, Juheeâ€™s work for this project has involved: Collecting teaching plans and classroom activities that have been implemented during the past five or so years; setting up a streamlined instruction for both head TFs and TFs so that they can contribute to the database; creating templates and other documents that facilitate future collection of pedagogical materials (e.g., student consent forms that allow use of student essays and creative projects for teacher training purposes); and building a web-based site holding all the above documents and files (a model for Juhee in creating this site is [the GovTeaches toolkit](https://govteaches.fas.harvard.edu/)).
