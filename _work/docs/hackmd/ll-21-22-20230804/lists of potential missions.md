# lists of potential missions

let's give these lists a little structure by sorting by Lab and by Project. In some cases this may duplicate the Airtable, but this is meant as a low-friction place to add loads of ideas WITHOUT cluttering up the Airtable too much.

## by Lab

Let's encourage MDFs in charge of labs to help us add things here.

### theatreLab

* improv games + AVLab mechanics
    * like drawing the stage for a partner's improvised performance
    * 

### mapLab

* map to 50 Church Studio
* map OF 50 Church Studio
* the AV system (cable network especially)


### AVLab

* work on AVSystem Airtable
* learning the ATEM (see intro mission sequence)
* 

## by project
