# The Future Thinking Series

Media & Design Fellow Ignacio Azcueta (RLL) has developed what is called The Future Thinking Series, a collaboration with Nicole Mills, Senior Preceptor in RLL. This project comprises a series of conversations around urgent topics in teaching: the future of interaction, the future of translation, the future of the textbook, and the future of the classroom. Ultimately, these conversations will be produced into short video clips that can be uploaded to the RLL Facebook page.
