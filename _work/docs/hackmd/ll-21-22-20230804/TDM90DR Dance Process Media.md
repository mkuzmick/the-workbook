## External Filming 

**External Filming in General:**
Bok Reps (Marlon, Casey, Luke) are needed to support the LLUFs in filming, as Jessi will need to divide her attention between the HDP students and the LLUFs. Further on in the semester it might not be as necessary to have one of them there, as the LLUFs will hopefully have done it a few times, but in the beginning it would be ideal to have someone to help them set up their shots, transfer equipment between Bok and HDC, and invite HDP students to try stepping behind the camera throughout the rehearsals. 

**External filming ideal story for Mondays 12-3PM:**
Option 1:
At 12PM, LLUFs + Bok Rep (Marlon, Casey, or Luke ideally) will meet at Learning Lab and carry necessary equippment (a few cameras, mics, tripods) to HDC. We will set up a few different shots, filming the HDP rehearsal from 12:30 - 2:30PM. At 2:30PM, they will pack up and bring the equipment back to Learning Lab. 

Option 2:
Jessi + help will bring equipment to HDC the Friday before the Monday shoot date, and LLUFs + Bok Rep will meet at HDC at 12PM to set up shots, film HDP rehearsal from 12:30-2:30PM, wrap up and carry equipment back to Bok. 

**External filming ideal story for evening rehearsals (Tues/Wed 6-8PM):**
Jessi + help will bring equipment to HDC a couple of hours before the rehearsal. LLUFs + Bok Rep will meet at HDC at 6PM and record from 6:30-7:30PM, wrap up and Jessi will retrieve equipment and bring back to Bok the following morning.
