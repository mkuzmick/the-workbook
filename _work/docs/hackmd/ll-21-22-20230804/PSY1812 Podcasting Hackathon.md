## notes from the instructor

We’re just going to listen to parts of their podcasts and give each other a final feedback. Not sure if it would be possible to create 8 different stations with headphones (mostly with 2 headphones each and 2 stations with 3 headphones)? One for each podcast. If so, we could just have them rotate to listen to the podcasts and make their final “peer review”. Also, we could do half of the stations and have different groups go first. For example, we could have 4 stations, if possible. Three stations with two headphones and one station with three headphones. If any of this is possible, it would be awesome! No worries if that’s not possible.

Also, since the mask mandate has been lifted, would it be ok for us to bring snacks? :) Since this is a class on intercultural perspectives on trauma and we’ve talked about several different cultures, the snacks will be culturally-themes if that’s ok
