## HOW AND WHY MIGHT WE EXPAND IT?

options
1. Horizons for All = helping people do literally the Horizons thing, but Faculty, grad students, potentially even undergraduates doing senior theses.
2. alt-academic-communication for all = things that go beyond the TED-talk-style talk
3. Ongoing Support = close to walk-in help for any student doing an unconventional project. Could involve consultation, workshops, open studio time, equipment.

## THINGS WE HAVE PLANNED FOR NEXT TERM

* Actual Horizons
* January Visuals Session
* ARC Thesis Writers Workshop
    * let's invite all participants to do an alt-accessory to their thesis
    * How can you present your thesis in a way that will help propel you beyond Harvard? What skills would be useful to learn? What competencies do you want to display?
        * let's have examples of what it might be
* Alt Thesis prototypes
    * next steps and looking back for grad students 
        * what I wish I knew (talk to your younger self or grads on their way in)
        * l'esprit d'escalier
    * take a dissertation chapter and turn it into something else
    * graphical abstracts in the sciences
* AMST201 report
    *
