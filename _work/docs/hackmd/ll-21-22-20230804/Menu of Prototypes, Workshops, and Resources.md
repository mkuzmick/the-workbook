# Menu of Prototypes, Workshops, and Resources

* **prototype-Shorthand**
Develop a prototype in Shorthand that uses both image and text in service of a larger claim. Additionally, produce a “how to” doc in markdown that a student in a course could use to complete this assignment. For more background on this project, read our [Shorthand Project Doc](/z4VZIgwWQVKTNq4VocXwew)
Tool: Shorthand
Courses: EASTD170: Medicine and the Self in China and the West
Domains: art history, film, anything using visual media

* **prototype-recorded-performance**


* **prototype-simplified-TED-Ed-video**

* **prototype-image-text-geodata**
Combining image, text, and geodata, create a “virtual postcard.” This will include geotagging a location, assigning it an image, and writing some text that like you would if you were sending a postcard from this location. The idea is that students “send” this postcard from the location/setting named in a source passage, for example from a literary work (but playing with this concept across different domains would be great!).For more background on this project, read our [image-text-geodata project doc](/rBe8VcJTQs2mH1hvxK8_dg).
Tools: Storymap JS, ArcGIS, Flourish
Courses: CHNSLIT280: A Tale of Two Cities: Shanghai and Beijing
Domains: literature, languages, geography, history, anything using maps!

* **prototype-comic-book-spread**
Tools: Ps, Id, Il
Produce a two page spread as an example of something we can either imagine many students doing as an assignment/activity or something we can imagine integrating into our media and story-production workflow. As you work, document your process and produce a tutorial or guide for future students on creating spreads using the wide variety of tools you can use for this purpose. For more background on this project, read our [Comic Book Spreads Project Doc](/D27SUVILRPiuLeeAv0OD7Q)

* **prototype-virtual-galleries**
Using 3D modeling tools like Unity and Blender, we’ll design a proof of concept for a virtual gallery (Unity) and the objects that might populate those galleries (Blender). This is an ongoing project, and we'd love to have great examples of workflows, tutorial docs, and the galleries themselves so we can show these to faculty and courses. For more background on this project, read our [Virtual Galleries Project Doc](/bHDTyoIbQim66bFp1HcLyw).
