# LLUF MANUAL Spring 2022

Welcome to Spring 2022 at the LL! Whether you have been around for a while or are just now joining, it is AWESOME to have you here!! I cannot wait to see what you all do this spring! 

**One super important thing to note:** To contribute to our visual storytelling of the LL, we are requiring you (but hopefully it will be more fun than annoying for you!) to [**SHOW-YOUR-WORK!**](/2pMQFrT5ScmihdRndYTz9w)(<-- check out this link for all the info!):
* ***at least*** every SHIFT: post in [#show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C)
* ***at least*** once a week: post in [#show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)

So, please make sure you adhere to (and have fun with!) this as you work this week! We are all really excited to see what you come up with! And totally reach out as you work (and Jordan will try to check in during your shift) to help make sure this all makes sense and goes well for you!

I was inspired by this language from a course syllabus and wanted to share because I think it carries over into our work-life here at the LL:
```
Health, Wellbeing, and Mutual Support: Amid a prolonged global pandemic and other 
contemporaneous crises, I think it’s safe to say that none of us is really OK circa spring 2022! If 
you tell us that you’re having trouble, we promise to be supportive, understanding, and 
empathetic and to try to help in whatever way we can. You never owe me any information 
about your health (mental, physical, or anything else), but you are always welcome to tell me 
about things you are going through or impediments you are facing. If you need extra help, or 
you need to miss class, or you need an extension on something, just ask and we’ll be able to 
work it out! If we can’t help, we will try to connect you to people who can.
```

## Logistics:
1. **Scheduling Your Shifts.** Please use the [LLUF Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aGFydmFyZC5lZHVfbWY0MWk2YWxyMHU2NW9pNjhwbzJzdGJkbmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) google calendar to schedule your shifts. 
2. **Work in Person.** We are taking the lead from the college here, and as long as classes are held in person, we will work in person to best support that mode of teaching & learning. With that said, please don't hesitate to communicate with us on your individual slack channel about any questions or requests you have.
3. **Post updates on your work.** Please follow the protocols for posting to #show-your-work and #show-and-tell. See *"super important note"* above for more details.
4. **Submit hours to PeopleSoft.** Usually by Thursday at 5pm, but we will notify you on slack if you need to submit at a diffferent time due to holidays, etc.


## Synchronous Work

You are encouraged to come to ALL of the synchronous work we offer. You are ***required*** to attend essentialsLab and any synchronous gathering that occurs during your shift if possible. Only exceptions if you have specific approval from Jordan.


   * **Friday morning designLabs** will meet 10:30-11:45 EVERY OTHER WEEK beginning 20220204.
   * **essentialsLab** section meeting. (see [essentialsLab syllabus](/SUysK0EBRxSPY-RzPocIqQ) for more details)
   * **Work Together Labs** will meet according to lab determination. Join the relevant slack channel and complete the when-to-meet if you are interested in working on projects related to:
        * [**#realityLab:**](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C2W34NACE) unity, blender, c4d, ar/vr
        * [**#graphicsLab:**]() graphic design, adobe Ai/Id/Ps, comics, illustrations
        * [**#avpLab:**](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C030K0HRZ9V) audio, visual, performance, film-essays, documenting dance, found footage, montage, fcpx, premiere, cameras, after effects
  * **pop up workshops & tutorials**. As needed, we will schedule workshop run throughs or tutorials to 1) help us prepare for an upcoming activity or to teach you a new cool and important skill not necessarily covered in essentialsLab.
   * **open studios & regularly scheduled programming**. As we schedule workshops and office hours for courses, we will keep you posted on relevant times that would be useful to have you come in and help. This might be as a sort of TA for a workshop we run, or as a peer media tutor for office hours, hackathons, and open studios.
        

## Asynchronous Work 
 * **Prototype Missions.** Anytime we need a Protoype for a course or MDF project! These may follow a Pop-up Workshop led by staff or the MDF, or they could be an assignment we are testing for faculty or Bok Seminar folks. Links to the prompts for these missions can be found in the "LLUF Week of" docs (which are posted at the beginning of each week to [#ll-undergraduate-fellows](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02E68UQP4M).
  * **Skill-Building Missions.** a LLUF has identified an area that they would like to build their skills in (For example, 3D modeling). They embark on an independent study of that skill, with a ton of guidance from staff and other fellows. See more in the evolving ["Skill-Building Missions"](/WFSQLjIbSa2p5yHjIHQM3Q) doc.
        
* **Stewardship Missions.** All of those tasks that help us all keep things running! Like organizing supplies, and slacking ideas for things to get, and setting up or re-setting the studio. Reach out to Jordan if you have an idea for a stweardship mission that you'd like to take on. We will post some requests in the LLUF Week Of docs as needed too.

* **Micro-Project Missions.** For getting work done. These will be concrete tasks or "special assignments" based on your skill set and availability.
