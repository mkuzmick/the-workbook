### Action Items âœ…

## last week's happenings

### Show-and-Tell Planning
Christine and Marlon met up to plan out a show and tell plan for Spring 2022. Sounds like we'll go with two main channels: `#ll-show-your-work` will be for images and quick notes documenting our work, of the sort you might post 5-20 of in a day (and it will send you markdown to embed what you wrote). `#ll-show-and-tell` will be for longer, blog-post sized explanations of your work (its significance perhaps, or something interesting you discovered while doing it, or instructions on how others can create something similar, etc.)

![Overhead image of cards that read "Show and tell. Why were you doing that? How did you do that?"](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02U42C3S7R/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=dd2da7e54f)


### Harvard Maps Collection // LL Collab

Marlon and Christine met with Belle Lipton, GIS Outreach Librarian at the Harvard Maps Collection and brainstormed possibilites for collaboration. To start, Casey is installing QGIS on all of the LL machines. Keep your eyes peeled for a collaborative workshop later this term.

### LL Stage

Marlon and Casey worked on plans and construction of the future stage set up in the Learning Lab studio.

### Academic Stories
Christine and Marlon met up with MDF Xiaomeng Han to talk about her scientific communication cartoons. These comics explain key concepts in neuroscience, specifically concepts that Xiaomeng knows students tend to struggle with.
