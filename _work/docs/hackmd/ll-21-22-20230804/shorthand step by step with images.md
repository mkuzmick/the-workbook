# shorthand step by step with images

1. Start new project
2. Add a background (focus) image for title page
    * Use the image icon to the right of the section display on the left hand of the screen.

3. For a [NYT type](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/16/arts/design/jasper-johns-memory-of-my-feelings.html?action=click&module=card&pageType=theWeekenderLink) scroll with text and an image, add a "background scrollmation"
    * Use the "add section" option on the left hand side
    * To change the image use the same turquoise image icon on the left hand of the screen 
    * Delete all of the existing images and upload your own using the bar on the right
* *It doesn't seem as though the same image can be copied over multiple sections of background scrollmation and media cannot be edited within shorthand.*     
* If necessary, refocus the image to ensure the most important section of the image is visible. 
    * This can be found in the screen where your image is uploaded

4. Add the necessary descriptive text and more background scrollmation sections on the left toolbar if necessary.
5. Use the "add sections" command to add a "scrollpoints slide"
    * Add a scrollpoint by using the turqouise pencil button above the pre existing text. This text also initially serves as a guide for how to use the feature.

6. Use the arrow button on top of the text to bring up a sidebar of the left which views each scrollpoint as a slide to rearrange.
