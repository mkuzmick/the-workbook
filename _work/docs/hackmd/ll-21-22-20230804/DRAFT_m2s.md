### What to look for (& what to stay away from):

when scrubbing look for moments of dynamism and human connection. Then for moments of focus during speech. Find moments when something interesting is going on physically.
look for sharpness in the eyes as top priority, mouth as second priority.
for the overhead angle, go for each discrete image 
(i.e. if they are drawing things, grab a still of each completed drawing or concept map)
don't privilege one gender or identity

### Export xml and run m2s script.
Create a project called “xxxxx_Stills” in your Final Cut Library (the title can be absolutely anything, as long as it has “still” in it.  Then export the .fcpxml file of this project.  Then make sure that your m2s config is set by going into terminal and typing m2s --config. If you see a value for outputDir, you’re set. If not, enter m2s --config --outputDir /path/to/your/m2s/folder.  Then, in terminal, type m2s /path/to/your/file.fcpxml.  You MAY have to run it twice in certain instances. If you have any trouble with it, talk to a member of the LL Staff.
