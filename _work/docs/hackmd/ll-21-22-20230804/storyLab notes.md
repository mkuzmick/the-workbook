# storyLab notes

## 20210917

Today we are working on the Intro Mission Sequence, which you'll be able to find [here](https://hackmd.io/ZSRcI0I-RcK0KGhOyxjhoQ) when it's done. 

This mission sequence will lead you through an array of activities that culminate in a little video introduction to your year working in the LL. You'll introduce yourself, tell us what you'll be working on this year, and then you'll offer a little explanation of why your work matters (i.e. if you are learning Blender, why is this useful? how does it connect to disciplinary learning objectives? to academic communication? to the goals and mission of Harvard College?)

There are added elements that you'll discover as you do it that are more the domain of theatreLab and AVLab--today we're going to focus on the storyLab component: the story of who you are, what you're doing, and why it matters.

### who you are

This may be the easiest bit. Just tell us your name and maybe one or two identifying characteristics. Could be your concentration, could be your house, could be your hometown. Pick one that actually says something about you.

### what you're doing

What are you doing this year at the Learning Lab? Are you docking with a Lab? Are you focusing on a particular type of activity? Are you learning a specific tool?


### why it matters

This is the big part. The rationale. 

And there are many directions you can take it.

* the most basic thing we need to know is how it connects to the Bok Center's mission (which is supporting undergraduate education and the professional development of Harvard's faculty and graduate students
* as far as undergrad education is concerned, it's a BIG thing, so you face choice
* it may make sense to tell the story of how you personally got interested in it, but you should connect this somehow connect to its more general importance for undergraduate education
