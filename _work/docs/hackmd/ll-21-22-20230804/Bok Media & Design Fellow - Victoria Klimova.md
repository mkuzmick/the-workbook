# Bok Media & Design Fellow - Victoria Klimova


### Projects
Victoria is a Bok Media & Design Fellow and graduate student in HGSE. Over the course of the year, Victoria worked with Professor Aysha Upchurch in support of the Duet Studio project, an interdisciplinary artistic-pedagogical practice that brings together individuals from a wide range of academic and artistic backgrounds to "duet" and collaborate. Duet Studio  launched at the Learning Lab in December, featuring a performance by Prof. Upchurch, who is a dancer and choreographer. From the footage captured at this event, Victoria edited a short video about the project that is now used as a way to introduce Harvard University community members to the project. Finally, Duet Studio held two additional events at the Learning Lab, facilitated by Victoria, MDF Nakul Grover, and Prof. Upchurch. These workshops asked participants to use studio materials to create duets and then to reflect on their artistic and educational work, more broadly. Duet Studio encourages collaborations across media, arts, and disciplines at Harvard, and documentation of the sort that Victoria and Nakul spearheaded is central to the project.
