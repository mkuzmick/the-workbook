# INFOGRAPHIC RESOURCES for PSY1845 Stigma, Discrimination, and Health
## Prompt
Create a 1-page infographic for a policy maker from your home state who is interested in reducing structural stigma against the group you are exploring this semester. In this infographic, you will provide the policy maker with information you think is relevant for understanding the issues confronting your group (e.g., basic demographic information, such as their prevalence in your state or prevalence of adverse health conditions). You will then advocate for a specific policy proposal (or proposals) that the policy maker should consider in order to reduce structural stigma, citing evidence for its potential effectiveness from this weekâ€™s readings or from other research you have conducted.

## Examples

## Resources

Infographics combine data, text and graphical design to offer viewers compelling and informative arguments and explanations. In the examples above, the abstract, often highly technical content of a policy paper or proposal is summarized in a visal argument that can be consumed at a glance. 

The Bok Center's Learning Lab has compiled some resources and tips here to help you create your infographics, but if you don't find exactly what you're looking for, or want a walkthrough of something specific, or run into challenges, don't hesitate to submit a question at [**help.learninglab.xyz**](http://help.learninglab.xyz)! We'll start with the tools in case you just want to get started immediately, but, if you can, stay tuned all the way to the bottom of the page for additional thoughts on the what and why of infographics.
