## what we did

[Montage Editing](https://hackmd.io/GNbT1-CqSaizaKl2O_8TOg)

CC and CD held two sections of a Premiere workshop for AFVS70 students. We used some of Eisenstein's principles of montage (e.g., metric, rhythmic, tonal, and overtonal) as a way to introduce students to editing in Premiere. Very few of the students had previous experience with Premiere, but they seemed to find the use of these principles of Soviet montage helpful as they made choices about cutting and arranging clips in the timeline. We used some footage of the Odessa steps sequence (from Battleship Potemkin) as a way to illustrate rhythmic, since this concept is a bit more complex.
