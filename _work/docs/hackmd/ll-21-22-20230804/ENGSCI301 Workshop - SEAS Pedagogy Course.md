## notes from the instructor

Hi all!
Thank you Marlo, Christine, and Jordan for your time on Tuesday. I've had a chance to chat with John on planning out the lesson on the 21st, based on our planning from Tuesday:
* Pre-work: TFs come prepared with a 5-minute presentation on a topic that they choose/are randomly assigned. They can bring their own props, but will be told to expect a mysterious prop that they must incorporate into their presentation.
* At the start of class, we'll be giving them the prompt of taking what they've prepared and adapting it for the stage. It might be good to give a quick blurb on the Learning Lab and a short demo of what they can do, such as seeing themselves in real time on the screens, and using the green screen to add art + animations behind them. This is also the time to talk about visual communication skills and strategies, I think.
* They'll be paired up and given 15 minutes to prepare their art and choreograph their lesson. We'll introduce the mysterious prop at this point (I'm thinking one prop per pair, so two props total).
* They'll deliver their 5-minute presentation (hard cutoff), followed by around 5 minutes of Q&A from the audience.
* This should be about 65-75 minutes into the class. We'll spend a bit of time reflecting on an exercise we did at the beginning of the semester where I had asked them to come with reasons for teaching. The reflections could be having achieved a goal, gained clarity/insight, or discovered a new goal.
* In the last few minutes, I'd like to close out with some more ideas of what the Learning Lab offers. Hopefully, this will encourage them to think about collaborations with the Learning Lab on their own, too!

Does this seem about appropriate? One of the TFs will probably have to leave early because she has a group meeting back on SEAS campus at around 4:30pm, but we should be good on time for everyone else.
