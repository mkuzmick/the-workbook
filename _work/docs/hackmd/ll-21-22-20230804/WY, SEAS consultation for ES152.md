# WY, SEAS consultation for ES152
Zoom
4/22/22, 2:30pm
MK, AB, DD


## Email from Instructor

I am going to be working on a project starting in Fall 2022 on the redesign of an undergraduate electrical engineering course.  In particular, I am interested in converting the course into a "flipped classroom" with recorded video lecture modules and associated problems to work and discuss in a flipped classroom.  I was wondering what sort of resources, references, and support you might be able to provide. 

Things are still at a very early stage, but I do have a very clear set of teaching objectives with respect to the technical content of the course as I just spent Fall 2021 completely revising the course content and lectures.  I have a fair amount of experience with the traditional lecture format used in engineering/science as well as the business school case study method and an open discussion format which I used for the Master in Design Engineering program that I founded about 7 years ago.  However, I would be interested in learning more about the flipped classroom format and in developing appropriate learning modules for the types of topics covered in this course.  



## Meeting Notes

**Dani's notes:**

ES 152 is a required class for electrical engineering concentrators. about ~25 students. would like to turn it into a flipped classroom. looking for technical support


WY asked-pedagogically, how to teach students with low quality textbooks? especially with short attention span. how to get students excited and hold their interests. production quality needs to go up to engage and keep them engaged.


WY wants to put together video modules (that will not be 75 minutes, more likely 10-20 minutes). students will view 2-4 per week. students should feel they can start to attempt the problem set. with the recovered time, students come to class with their attempt at the problem set and then work through one of the sets or a new one. have students work together as groups, work together to solve. get away from using class time to go over definitions and concepts. the course also has associated labs with it which are an important part. would be great to have a cool way to integrate labs with the class sessions. (there is a kit that all students can take home)


MK excited about these videos as replacement for the textbook, we can help prototype and incubate. in the summer we can work directly with WY or if he has a grad student in mind that could work as a MDF on this project. widener library and the media production center - MK suggested reaching out to a real studio with the capacity to help do all of the videos he wants.

wants something that doesn't have to be perfect but that works as a flipped classroom. wants to experiment. wants to make it a little more REAL for students. some of the formula derivations could work as whiteboard, khan-academy style videos. lots of physical things like electromagnetic waves, maybe things you can't see but analogies that could be drawn. going to use computer simulation tools. already has talking head, recorded lectures styles. 

coming into the studio and trying a few things, using an overhead camera, writing on an ipad, etc.
having some examples for showing something in 2D, 3D, an equation, etc. mix of different types of videos in an ecosystem of the course. a couple of nice videos for a couple of key topics. 


suggestions bounced around
* AB suggested a student foil for this, where WY has to explain. (almost like a court testimony??)
* MK brought up having students submit questions and then a TF compiles the top 3 questions of the week, and sends to professor.
* WY was hoping for a test audience (LLUFs! + staff). really wants to understand the user experience.
* MK suggested assigning the students making videos about key contacts about the course. almost like a tiktok. but WY said it would require a redefinition of the course (like giving credit for students creating videos)
* AB: other things checking for conceptual understanding, like watch the video and take an instantaneous quiz. and THEN they do the p-set. they would have to recap what they learned (it could flow in the course). immediate feedback from module.

end goal objectives for the course should be different, knowing that harvard students do some many different things. WY feels an intellectual obligation for the outcome to be giving the students who want to go to graduate school enough information, but students who want to go to business school suffer. 
* from AB: specifications grading book. where assignment structure of the course is like a tree. 

## action steps:
WY will reach out at the end of summer/fall to see the space and shoot a few test videos.
