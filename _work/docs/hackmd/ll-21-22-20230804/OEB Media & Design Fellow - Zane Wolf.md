# OEB Media & Design Fellow - Zane Wolf

### Projects
Zane has worked on many exciting projects in her time so far at the Learning Lab. Some of the projects Zane has been focused on this year include:

**Supporting the [SEAS Faculty Visualization Project](https://seasvis.github.io/ )**

The SEAS Faculty Visualization Project visualizes the connections between faculty in SEAS, producing a visualization of these collaborative networks. Zane made encoding improvements, aesthetic improvements, and backend/frontend improvements to the existing Matrix visualization, which shows the shared research interests across SEAS faculty. Currently Zane remade the existing Arc visualization from scratch, as the old version was in a proprietary format and hard to tinker with. In her version, she was able to add gradients to the paths, incorporate complicated hover/click functions on the circles and paths, and add color blind functionality. The Arc visualization shows collaborations (from shared authorship on google scholar papers) between faculty members with SEAS. 

**Developing the [Ocean Affinity at Harvard University (OAHU) website](https://trusting-colden-da693e.netlify.app/)**

This website, which will soon be shared with the Harvard community at large, is the central site for OAHU, a multidisciplinary research group comprising scholars working in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and environmental studies, among other fields. The website provides the means to explore and join the Ocean Affinity community at Harvard, to learn about grants and receive help with the application process, and to explore, gain access to, or share data with the community. Beyond its relevance to scholars already working in the field, the site also has a section for undergraduates who might like to connect with researchers as they embark on their studies in this area. Above all, the OAHU website serves to connect people who are broadly interested in oceans, providing an invaluable service to learners of all levels.

**Developing the [Sea Monsters website project](https://seamonsters-bb334.web.app/ ) for Professor Peter Girguis's Sea Monsters Freshman Seminar.** 
Zane created this site using a React App. in Sea Monsters, students are asked to draw their own sea monster, what is most horrifying to themselves. There is always great diversity, from large boat-swallowing goliaths, to swarms of sea flees. Later, students are asked to create a mythology for their monsters, after learning more about the mythology and cultures surrounding other famed sea creatures. We wanted a way to showcase this creative diversity and engage the students, and this website serves as both a gallery and a fun game. 

**Hosting tutorials and developing resource documents related to coding, data visualization, AR/VR, and mapping.**
Throughout the year, Zane regularly led groups of Media & Design Fellows, Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows, and Learning Lab staff through tutorials about [Mapbox](/JrzTNK-FSqKUOrbD1deeog), [data encoding/sketching](/ia25si6HTD2_MBiwwdjGCQ?both), and [D3](/JDifXR_fT--uRVrSNa3F6Q). To read more about Zaneâ€™s tutorials, visit her [HackMD page](/jep5aiPnTwOA02YuRQyX7Q), which she regularly updates. These tutorials are invaluable resources for both beginners and more advanced learners. Overviewing a range of fundamentals and leading users through a few exercises, these tutorials could be adapted for and integrated into courses that have students working with data visualization tools and coding. She is currently developing a gatsby-airtable tutorial based on her work with OAHU.
