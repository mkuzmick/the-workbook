From Jie:
VIdeo essay editing - video essays are increasingly popular among students who are not as comfortable acting in their own films, so if they can learn how to make supercuts with split screens, put voiceover narration over an existing clip, separating audio from visual tracks, and possibly changing the colors and speed of clips that would be great.  Other really useful skills are downloading videos from Youtube and screen-recording from streaming websites for video essay editing.  Here are some video essays I would probably be showing in class within the first 4 weeks:
