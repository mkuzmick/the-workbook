# Harvard Dance Project Documentary Film

During the spring 2022 term, Media & Design Fellow Jessi Stegall is supporting The Harvard Dance Project, a production course that instructs students in dance, choreography, and creative process. Working with the Learning Lab staff and Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows, Jessi is directing, shooting, and editing a documentary-style film about the course. So far, Jessi has completed a series of introductory interviews with students, asking them about their backgrounds in dance, as well as their creative practice and goals. Jessi also has captured rehearsals and will continue to do so over the course of the term. At the end of the semester, students will perform and in a final filmed interview, watch and reflect on their introductory interviews. Thus, the documentary about HDP will ultimately trace the students' development.
