### Projects
Sharol Liu is a Bok Media & Design Fellow and a graduate student at HGSE. Sharol has an interest in UX design and decided to develop a project that helps graduate students use the principles of UX design thinking to create teaching portfolios. Leading a group of Media & Design Fellows and Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows through a portofolio analysis and making activity, Sharol developed an interactive tutorial that allowed workshop participants to start planning and designing their professional portfolios.
