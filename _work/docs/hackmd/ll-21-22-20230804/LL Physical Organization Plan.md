# LL Physical Organization Plan

Let's make a plan about where things will be stored in the LL! Also a plan for handling computer accounts and programs.

Common questions we're getting:
* where can I find a charger?
* where can I find a particular connection cable?
* where can I find ____ making supply?


What materials need to be on hand in the studio?
* Paper
* cards
* game pieces

Storage Resources:
* LL Studio - (Mostly) inexpesive things that we grab more than once per day.
    * Black Shelves - 
        * Scissors
        * Glue sticks
    * Orange cart - documenting station
    * Blue cart - 
        * USBC to USBC
    * 
* Small storage room - Less expensive things that we access often.
    * Cabinet - iPads, Laptops + charging station
    * Headphones
* Large storage room - More expensive things that we don't access often


Wish list:
* Charging station for the LL studio
* 5D camera with cards, etc.
* the hope is the LLUFs will be working on desktops in the studio or on their own machines, limiting the need for the LL laptop fleet
