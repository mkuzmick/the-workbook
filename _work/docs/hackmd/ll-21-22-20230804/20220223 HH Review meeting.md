* animated graphs and timelines. seems self-sufficient, but we could do some proofs of concept in After Effects
    * [folder of examples here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_T4HltVxDMCHjXAaGh8qpqWyfgf_DOkJ)

* Hi @marlon!  I added relevant R data visualizations that I hope can be refined and incorporated as some of the visuals in my presentation.  Would love to hear what you think and/or talk through the best way of coordinating: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uhL3ByxVq3GbaOoiQl_nD06FjSuHd7f3?usp=sharing

### to do

- [ ] remake some of the R data visualizations in AE or other. show to Chika for feedback.
    - [ ] style references: `/Volumes/10_01/projects/hh-chika/Exports`
- [ ] accompany with timelines and maps?
- [x] Katie - ask Chika if we can have the data for these in case we have to model anything with more precision

https://vimeo.com/383189400

* has 3D tools of his own, and we can help animate them
* pymol to c4d or Blender could be cool?
 ### to do
 - [x] Katie ping him and ask if there are any concrete asks for us

## juliana garcía-mejía

* shooting loads of video in Arizona
    * [lookbook](https://hackmd.io/GDmajTU_QhS4QIdOEN-9xA)
* 3d (or 2d?) animation of the transit of a planet in front of sun) . . . with graph representing X
    * blender or after effects
* exploded view of telescope
    * combo of solidworks with c4d or blender (maybe AE for text)

![Juliana's research, Harvard Horizons 2022--this visualization is from NASA](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03109STVTQ/screen_shot_2022-02-01_at_4.39.50_pm.png?pub_secret=1e25d3b600)

### in prog
- footage acquisition is happening :)
### to do
- remake this indblender or c4D: [full video](https://bokcenter.slack.com/files/U6RLWQX3P/F032ZLK2ELT/transit_method_single_planet.mp4)
- exploded view--solidworks to blender workflow
    - Micheal has been working on this
    - the solidworks files are incredibly complex, all of the pieces are really split up into different files
- [x] Katie ask Juliana for a tour of the solidworks file (the assembly) so we can figure out where to find an assembled file
    - [x] Can she export with the method Micheal found?
- montage editing later on

## karina mathew
* stock footage
* Luke has montage of all clips
    * `/Volumes/10_01/projects/hh-karina`
* [lookbook for simulated networks](https://hackmd.io/7u8O52PERZC89SuZE22etQ)

[Knowledge is Beautiful](https://smile.amazon.com/Knowledge-Beautiful-Impossible-Invisible-Connections-Visuali[…]&sprefix=information%2520is%2520beautiful%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-2)

### to do
- [ ] put together some mock-ups of neurons, galaxies, networks
    * a blender or x-particles or trapcode example or two wouldn't be bad
- [ ] run these past karina to figure out what she wants

## nicolo foppiani

* maybe 3d models?
    * maybe 3 x 2d orthographic views animating to 3d space
    * 
* will need help making the keynote
* animating some of his particles?

## vanessa braganza

### to do
* decoder wheel
    * prototype in After Effects or elsewhere
* shoot in Houghton (schedule)
    * Location notes: https://hackmd.io/7KX1N043TkSbbURluriNYA
* face morph (V will share 3 images with us).
