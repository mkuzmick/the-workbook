# AVLab Podcast Workshop Notes

designing a podcast workshop for ANE197: Bible and Empire.

## course and assignment details

### sample prompts
1. Connecting imperial history and biblical text
Example: What are the challenges when using the Bible to reconstruct imperial encounters in ancient Israel/the ancient Near East? Is there a particular event and corresponding text that serves as an illustrative case study of these interpretive challenges, and how we might overcome them?

2. Connecting theory, text, and history
Example: Is there a postcolonial theorist whose work is particularly relevant to the study of the Bible and/or the history of ancient Israel? What are the potential limitations of his/her/their work when studying ancient texts and contexts? 

3. Connecting material culture and biblical text
Example: In what ways are imperial interactions represented at the “Mesopotamia” section (third floor) of the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East? How do these representations assist us in reconstructing the impact of Neo-Assyrian imperial claims on Israel and Judah in the Iron Age II and in interpreting the biblical texts that describe Neo-Assyrian hegemony?

4. Connecting past and present events
Example: What is the legacy of the Bible and ancient Israelite history in colonial contexts today? Is there a recent world event or news item that illustrates the complex relationship between the Bible and contemporary situations of war, conflict, or exploitation? 

5. Connecting personal story with biblical text
Example: How does the topic “Bible and Empire” intersect with personal narratives of colonial exploitation, racial disparity, or other forms of power or injustice? (These narratives can relate to your own experience or to the experiences of others.) In what ways does reader context affect biblical interpretation? Can we ever “objectively” study the past?
