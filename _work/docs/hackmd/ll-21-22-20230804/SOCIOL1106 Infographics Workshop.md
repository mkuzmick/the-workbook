## space and gear prep

Overhead at the main studio table
art supplies on tables
buttons and prep white boards

## ll plan

Start with models: 10 mins
What do you like
What works well
Why are they effective

Give a taxonomy: 
Maps
chunks
Networks/nodal

A little bit about graphic design principles


Then activity where they use buttons with conceptual designs and then use whiteboards or tables to decide what types of graphics are useful for identifying causes/processes

What conceptual graphics allow you to tell the story you want to tell?

30 mins: Small taste of Canva - try to build a quick infographic based on what one or two groups have done 

mention Illustrator as a way to make icons and have a space for them to work on it?
