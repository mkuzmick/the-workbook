# mission: before and after

Find something thatâ€™s wrong.  
Take a photo.
Fix it. 
Take a photo.

## EXAMPLE 
Here we see some crayons on the table, out of place, comprising a mess that will bring sadness to anyone who happens upon them. It would not be going too far to argue that the crayons themselves are sad, neglected, ignored, not gathered into a community, not enfolded into their home.

Here we see them in their home. See how happy they are? See how happy you are, seeing them happy?
