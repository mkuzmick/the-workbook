# INTERNAL LL PROJECT IDEAS FOR J-TERM 2022

## Workflow

### priorities
* physical storage (Casey with Jordan)
    * large and small storage rooms
    * and studio storage for immediately needed items (power included)
* youtube-presentational-video and prompter setup (Luke with others)
    * both in brick studio (maybe a little more locked down) and as mobile rig that you can move around the LL or take on location
* recording workflow (Casey with MK)
    * for pgm1 and pgm2, a standard couple of devices to record basically all day whenever
    * and documentation for non-media people to know how to do this
    * and let's also maybe think about how to get them to help out on the ingest part of this
* ingest (MK with Luke and Casey)
    * augmenting ingest script
    * adding some auto-deliverables
        * sync
        * multicam exports with burned-in TC
        * io2s
        * 
* deliverables and to-do tracking (Luke with Katie)
    * airtable for media in process (and done)
    * 
* handling non-video files (Casey with Luke)
    * stills
        * workflow for producing, storing, tagging, sharing
        * does backup of m2s-type stuff go in LR or on Synology?
    * 
* lights and stage (MK with Casey & Luke)
