# image-geo-text-prototype-mission
deadline: 20220218

## the goal: 
Prototype an assignment that encourages students to explore the settings found in literary works in the textual *and* visual modes.

Through your prototype, answer the question: How does a particular place matter to the story (or plot) of a given work of literature? Or more generally, how does location itself tell a story and advance our understanding of place and its significance?

For more background on this project, read our [Project: prototype-image-text-geodata Doc]([/z4VZIgwWQVKTNq4VocXwew](/rBe8VcJTQs2mH1hvxK8_dg))

Choose a passage from a work of literature + find an image of the place mentioned in that passage. Choose your tools and start to develop a workflow.

## the steps:
**1.** **Choose a literary passage to work with.** *Try to spend between 10 min to 30 min on this step.* Some considerations as you decide:
* Is there a passage that you are currently reading for a course that might work well for this prototype?
* does a particular work of literature come to mind when you think of setting/location as a vital element?
* what is an ideal length of a passage for this prototype?

***post a picture of your passage to show-your-work with a bit of text on why you chose it.***

**2.** **find an image of the place mentioned in that passage.** *Try to spend between 10 to 30 min on this step.*

***post your image to show-your-work with a caption including the location and the literary work***


---


**3.** **combine image/text/geodata in a creative way.** *Try to spend between 1 to 2 hours on this step.* This might be a postcard designed in adobe Ai, an animation in adobe Ae, or a storymap...really think outside of the box if you want to! 

***Develop and document your workflow as you go to help us develop student facing guides on how to do what you've done.***

***Post all of your updates as you go in the [show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C) slack channel.***

**4.** When you complete your final image-geo-text prototype, post in the  [show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR) channel. Include a brief reflection on your process; 1-2 paragraphs of what you would say if you presented this prototype in a show-and-tell. Note: we will potentially be sharing this with faculty so keep that audience in mind as you write. :)
