## learning objectives
- have food
- talk to each other
- get a sense of the space and where things are a bit


## possible mechanics

- Bok introductions (10 mins)
- looping media on screens of past projects
    - needs sourcing and editing
- some sort of activity? how much time?
- introductions? as MDFs? as scholars?
- show and tells from this years' people?
- green screen
    - the dani name drop
        - set design for presentation
    - full body introduction presentation 
        - with partners (2 and 2?)
        - one for a small group?
        - with deliberate randomization or complication?
    - full body buttons
    - tennis table key paper 2x2 (locate yourself on an XY grid?)
        - moving people around on the grid with ATEM?
    - compare and contrast through 2-up using key 2
    - layering of keys to achieve reveal effect
    - design an introductory tableau
    - album cover
    - design your name on paper?
    - using miniatures as key layer from 70-200 or 100mm
    - imitating (literally or more figuratively) some ad or other piece of media? 
    - some meme-ish like thing?
    - compose two contrasting shots and they inhabit them or perform in them?
- stations
- small group sharing
- personality quizzes
- secretly shared property activity ()
- most unlikely thing in common (plus presentation)
- mdf swag bag - cards and a brush pen, special button?
- badging mechanic - get badges at each station
- if there are prompts, they should be prompting folks to share about themselves to they can get to know each other
- (good) constraint that the the "lesson instructions" should be a part of the activity (?) 
- petting zoo, maybe between 5-7 spaces/activities (must pet at least 3 animals before you leave):
    - full body green screen with main table
    - mic taste testing and Logic
    - two shots compare/contrast (Jessi?)
    - paper stuff (buttons, making boxes)
        - could be collecting small button badges that would fit on large name badges that we pre-make
    - 3D modeling with clay
    - video explainer station
    - Procreate/illustration/animation area (Xiaomeng?)
    - musicLab?
    - datavis activity (everyone visualize the no. 23)
    - games station (key theories as set pieces; types of works you do in different zones - hearth, workbench, etc.)
* determine who (staff+past MDFs) will be at each station

## narrowed down list - 

At each station, you'll introduce yourself!

1. set design/projected images 2D/3D paper backdrops (at table 1)
    - making things out of paper and working with JK
3. full body green screen (green screen area)
4. mic taste testing/music lab (music room)
5. games and game mechanics (coffee table)
    - meta thing where JK makes the map or passport?
    - theatre zone - Jessi could be here?
6. datavis and illustrations (digital imaging station)
    - nancy duarte (?) thing OR datavis activity (everyone visualize the no. 23) 
    - in greenscreen zone? separate table?
    - Xiaomeng drawing in an app that shows up in keying; if she draws on green than we can key that and she'd be drawing on the stage, e.g.
7. analysis of images and films/annotations (at table 2)

## narrowed down list 2 - 

1. tactile zone: making things out of paper and working with JK (accent the tactile pleasures of paper, magnets, etc)
2. visual zone: digital imaging station (Xiaomeng or someone draws in an app that shows up w/keying; analysis of images w/annotations)
    - you can capture people on screen w/cameras
    - with green paper cut out we reveal what camera can see
    - or films that exist on a computer, we can see these
    - a person on stage can interact with all of these things, including tools that you'd be using in teaching (Illustrator, e.g.) (Full Body Green Screening)
    - camera w/long lenses that can be in 2 up view
3. audio zone: mic taste testing in music room w/Daniel and Dezhawn
4. food zone



### or sense based

**seeing:** greenscreen, cameras, images
**hearing:** microphones, music
**touching:** paper, buttons, magnets
**smelling and tasting:** food

**interacting:** game mechanics

The content today is you. Your names, your histories, your work as a teacher and scholar---anything you think people might be interested in.

But we'll play with some of the many tools we have in the LL Studio to help you and your students communicate.

## notes

### on ATEM and keying


- Key 3 = the stage MINUS green
- Key 2 = maybe a preconfigured key made from two green frames (sometimes this is on table 2, but for Thursday maybe we can just use a still? or just table 1?)
- Key 1 = the main table MINUS green
- bottom layer = the main source we initially see (cam 5, say, where we see ourselves, or cam 8, where we see the computer)
    - when presenting about something on the computer, this is cam 8
    - when wanting to show performing, this is cam 5
    - when wanting to show multiple camera angles, this is SS1 or SS2 (supersource)
