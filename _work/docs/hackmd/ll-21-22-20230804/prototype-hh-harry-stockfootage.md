# prototype-hh-harry-stockfootage

this is a LOT less technical(but no less helpful!), Harry is looking for some background stock footage of cells, like you find in the video below. 

the goal is to find 7-10 clips like these [and upload them here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i9OC10igguzZN3bRS4N90ALAe-1bo_Vy?usp=sharing)

## where to start

you can imagine by now, Google is your best friend here. but to start things off, here's a good place to start!

your best bet is to look for `1080p/1920x1080` or larger. but don't go any smaller than `720p/1280x720`
