# Media & Design Fellow Projects in STEM courses

## Graphical Abstracts in MCB80: Neurobiology of Behavior

![Graphical abstracts created by MCB80 Students](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02QP7J5BQR/hhmodelgraphicabstract_simplifiedversion_xiaomenghan_20210921.png?pub_secret=fb564f1e72)

In MCB80, students are encountering scientific papers for the first time. The course introduces students to several seminal research papers in neuroscience, which Media & Design Fellow Xiaomeng Han is adapting into graphical abstracts. These graphical abstracts illustrate for students how original research in neuroscience was conducted, helping them gain a better understanding of important findings and processes. In support of the graphical abstracts project, Xiaomeng has developed a tutorial in Adobe ProCreate, a tool that can be used in illustration/graphic design projects. Xiaomeng will continue to refine this tutorial so that future MCB MDFs and TFs can share these materials with students enrolled in the course. Below, you can see some illustrations that graduate and undergraduate fellows at the the Learning Lab created by following Xiaomengâ€™s tutorial.

## PhySci3: Electromagnetism, Circuits, Waves, Optics, and Imaging

The Learning Lab has supported PhySci3's art supply-driven explainer videos project. Students are able to use the Learning Lab studio equipment as they create recorded visualizations that explain key course concepts. This assignment increases undergraduate students' facility with complex concepts. We also support TFs who create these explainer videos for students.

## Podcasts in OEB50: Genetics and Genomics

In consultation with OEB faculty, MDF Grace Burgin chose podcasting as the medium for the OEB50 project, both for its feasibility in a remote semester and for the ways in which it would push students to present science without relying on diagrams and data visualizations to do the heavy lifting. The audio-only format required students to heighten audience interest by explaining the rationale for and implications of research studies, using sound effects to set the scene, and perhaps most importantly, relating genetics to people through stories.
