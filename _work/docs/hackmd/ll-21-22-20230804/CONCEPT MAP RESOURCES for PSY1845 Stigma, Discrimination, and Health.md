# CONCEPT MAP RESOURCES for PSY1845 Stigma, Discrimination, and Health

## Prompt

Prepare a concept map that visually depicts the core ideas of this week's reading in relation to your chosen topic. How do social forces work in contexts of unequal power to keep the stigmatized "in," "down" and/or "away?" Your concept map should offer a clear synthesis of the course readings and their application to your topic.

### Practical Details

While there are many digital tools for creating concept maps, for this assignment you will work with physical elements (paper, pens, markers--and anything else you think might help you offer a visual explanation of your ideas).

You can work with plain or colored paper and cut it up, mark it up, fold itâ€”whatever you think will help you capture your ideas best (and make these ideas legible to your audience). Since you will not have access to some of the automated layout features that digital tools involve (i.e. auto-centering, snapping-to-align, etc.) you will have to take additional care when positioning the elements of your concept map!

Once done, take an overhead shot of the completed concept map and submit it to Canvas. If the camera is *directly* above the paper, and all the angles are square, you should end up with a perfect, undistorted shot. Try to capture somewhere with flat, even light. And sometimes it actually helps to be a little further above the page and then zoom in, if your phone or camera allows you to do that.
