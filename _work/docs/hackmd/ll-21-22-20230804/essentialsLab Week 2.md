## Magazine Spread
I need approximately 1,000 words to fill my magazine spread. 

The novel *Dracula* was written by Irish author, assistant, and manager Bram Stoker in 1897. He lived largely in obscurity in his lifetime, and was in fact better known for his work with famed Shakespeare stage actor Henry Irving's career. Stoker managed books, events, and jobs for Mr. Irving for most of the actor's professional career. The first line of Mr. Stoker's obituary reads: *Bram Stoker, author, theatrical manager, close friend and advisor of the late Sir Henry Irving, died in London last Sunday.* How did a work by a man so few people cared about become a ubiquitious figure of pop culture? It is the exploration of this project that I believe can answer that question. Continue further into the spread -- if you dare -- to learn why. 

"Dracula" grips its readers immediately, planting them in the story of Jonathan Harker, and English solicitor heading to meet Count Dracula, an innocent-enough customer interested in purchasing a new home in London. The Count, as Jonathan so politely refers to him, is a member of the long Dracula family in Transylvania, a territory of Eastern European Romania. 

The first four chapters constitute one of the greatest horror stories ever written; the remaining twenty-eight chapters ask the reader deeply concerning questions concerning the enjoyment of such horror and fantasy. The novel is an iceberg itself; learning the horror of Dracula from Jonathan Harker's stay is not complete without understanding the tedious work of the rest of the novel -- executing Dracula and his bands of evil vampiric women. 

The style of "Dracula" is a distancing effort employed by the author. All tales are told through journal and diary entries, letters, medical records, and newspaper clippings. Stoker never pushes his reader too close to the material. Perhaps out of fear for his reader's sake. After all, as Mina Harker says to Dr. Seward, the written word is much easier to consume apathetically than what is heard or seen. I believe that part of Dracula's long-running appeal as a villain and trope is the character's malleability through media. Dracula can be reformulated for any media -- film, television, video game, art, comic, poem, costume -- for any age. It is particularly Dracula's accessibility to extremely young audiences -- children as old as 3 or 4 -- that is most interesting to me. The Count on Sesame Street speaks in an affected Transylvanian-esque accent while befriending children and puppets alike. And yet, no one is meant to be terrified of The Count, as Jonathan fears his Count. Herein lies the tension. Count Dracula has been far removed from his monstrous roots, making him increasingly tangible, relatable, and non-threatening to various audiences. It is almost as if Count Dracula was meant to fade into a fable; his presence is only tracked through collections of journal entries and stories; he is never acknowledged as an active member of the storymaking process. Depending on who is telling the story, Dracula becomes whatever an author wants him to be. There is no record to set these rogue authors straight, no manual or handbook for Dracula-related activities that they must follow. In each media, Dracula falls to the whims of his new creator, which accounts for how we have Bram Stoker's Dracula and Hotel Transylvania -- two extremely different stories. 


Is there another way to use media to transform Stoker's text? Is there a better way to read and reread and recreate Dracula? In my project, I propose a multi-media interactive exploration of the story Stoker wrote in "Dracula". The malleability and distance that Stoker created for Dracula has driven the character away from the source text, with new and different media contributing to the runaway story. I want to harness these same media techniques -- animation, 3D modelling, sound design, video editing -- to create a step-by-step interactive experience of "Dracula". Starting with Jonathan Harker's encounter with the Count, and highlighting important moments in the text all the way til Dracula's final breath, this project will demonstrate how media techniques can be used to illuminate a source text rather than abandon it. 

This is a picture of the original copy of Bram Stoker's "Dracula". A yellow cover, with red text certainly made a statement when the novel was published. I embrace the non-comformity of Stoker, and Stoker's adapters, in their pursuit of their creative vision. I love modern adaptations of Dracula, including the far-fetched ones that seem not to resonate a bit with Count Dracula. Rather than creating a new Dracula adaptation like these, my project will instead act as a magnifying glass for Stoker's text, revealing important literary connections not previously observed in the narrative. Using media, the story comes to life in the same way as its adaptations, but with a stronger focus on what Stoker got right.
