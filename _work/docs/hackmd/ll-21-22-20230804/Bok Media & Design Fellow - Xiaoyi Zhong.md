Xiaoyi Zhong is a Bok Media & Design Fellow and a HGSE graduate student. During her time at the Learning Lab, Xiaoyi has developed her skills in 3D modeling significantly, geared toward supporting major projects like Harvard Horizons--public-facing talks given by Harvard doctoral students about their dissertation research. Using Blender, Xiaoyi developed assets for Harvard Horizons scholars' presentations, including a series of visualizations meant to exemplify post-human epistemologies and ways of conceputalizing extraterrestrial contact. As Xiaoyi worked on these assets, she meanwhile built a robust collection of resource documents that students can use to complete class projects that use 3D modeling. These resources included both video and written tutorials. Xiaoyi also developed some in-class activities that courses could use if they wished to introduce students to the basics of 3D modeling. Xiaoyi has also created virtual galleries and has been developing resources in support of these types of projects as well.
