South London Forever- Florence + the Machine

    And I go home alone
    I drive past the place that I was born
    And the places that I used to drink
    Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
    Outside the Joiners Arm's like foals unsteady on their feet
    With the art students and the boys in bands
    High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met
    I thought it doesn't get
    Better than this
    There can be nothing better than this
    Better than this
    And we climbed onto the roof, the museum
    And someone made love in the glass
    And I'd forgot my name
    And the way back to my mother's house
    With your black cool eyes and your bitten lips
    The world is at your fingertips
    It doesn't get better than this
    What else could be better than this?

I couldn't think of a text with a setting that has the explicitness that this project requires that I've read recently, but was thinking about descriptions of places that aren't in film etc (ie that I have to conjure myself).
I came to "South London Forever" as I realised that it might be a little easier to get to grips with software that I don't know how to use when I'm thinking about the kinds of places I'm comfortable with.
I actually spent a few years at the high school Florence Welch went to and so would pass through Camberwell, the London borough she grew up in and the setting of much of this album. While I don't know the actual setting of the song off the top of my head, I think knowing what the area looks like etc might be useful.
The passage is pretty short, but it is explicit and the only part of the song where the setting integral. I'm not sure how the length will affect the project but I know that it might not give me sufficient material. I guess I'll find out!


**the places** 

* I started with the named places in the song and using my knowledge of the area as well as google maps, could work out a lot of the places Florence is referencing.

* I realised that the Joiners Arms is  nearby UAL Camberwell, which meant I felt it also necessary to have a look at the street view along here as well

While Welch is writing of her memories in the early 2010s and therefore the landscape probably looks different now in comparison ot then, Camberwell is a notoriously gentrified area of London and it is still very clear in the google maps street view. Once I started collecting images of the area in comparison to the locations she described in the song, I began to piece together some ideas of what the prototype will be looking at.

For example, there is a public housing unit on the same road and the elaborate art school building that Welch attended.
