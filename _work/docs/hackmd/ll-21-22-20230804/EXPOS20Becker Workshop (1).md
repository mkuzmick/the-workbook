### notes from project log
March 10 session:
* Work on the visual aspects of their arguments
* Graphic design principles
* Get students to think about the visual argument component early, they will have turned in their close reading essay on March 8th. Students will have provided an appendix of images. 
* They have a sense that there should be an argumentative function of the images. You should be able to look at the images and get a sense of what argument the author is making (and if you can’t figure it out then there is something wrong with the argument).
* Teach students how to use images functionally. If you lay out multiple images in one slide, how do you indicate that you are comparing and contrasting them? How do you make the visual arguments? Moves of art history, art criticism:
    * Showing a detail
    * Showing 3 members in a set
    * Showing something in context
    * Compare / contrast
* Christina will look in to her syllabus and send her readings
    * Help us understand her critical, theoretical lens
    * Star the readings that students tend to cite in their papers
* We can help with the image printing - Christina send their appendices and we can rip the images, have them on the computers and printed out
    * Divide them by section
* Can cover image capture to help them capture their own images to analyze
* Resonance and Wonder: http://stephengreenblatt.com/sites/default/files/Karp-Levine.pdf
    * Wonder = stop in your tracks because it’s beautiful, dramatic lighting, etc.
    * Resonant display = ex. Temples / converted to Nazi places / converted to Jewish center in Prague. The context really matters, history– how many lives has the place or object had before. Questions of materiality. Socioeconomic or political circumstances. How did it serve the community or family. What emotions would this object have inspired?
