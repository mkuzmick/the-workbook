# EASTD170: Some instructions related to the image-editing tools!

**Using Preview on Mac:**

If you have a Mac, you can use Preview to highlight a detail on the image. You will need to:
* Open the image in Preview
* On the left hand side of the toolbar at the top of the page, select the "lasso" tool
* Using the lasso, trace around the outside of the detail you would like to highlight
* Copy the detail you have lassoed (either by using command + c or right-clicking and selecting "Copy")
* Paste a copy of the detail
* Place this copy of the detail on top of the original image, making them overlap perfectly
* Go to the "Tools" menu
* Select "Adjust Color"
* Bring down the contrast on the original image (now the background image) so that the detail you want to highlight stands out

**Using Canva:**
* Go to canva.com
    * Either sign in with your Harvard Google account (if you have one) or make a free account
* Create a "Presentation"
* On the left-hand side of the page, click "Uploads" and upload the image
* Click and drag the image onto the slide (you might have to move it around a bit so that it automatically fills the entire slide)
* On the left-hand side of the page, click "Elements"
* Choose a basic shape (circle, triangle, square, etc.) and set the color to black
* Use different sizes of these basic shapes to fill in everything around the part of the image you want to highlight
    * You will likely need to use several different shapes and many different sizes!
* Select all of the shapes and at the top of the page, click "Group" so that all of the shapes stay together
* Go back to your Uploads and click and drag another copy of the original image into the same slide
* Click the checkerboard icon in the top right of the page and reduce the transparency a bit
* Your detail should look highlighted now!

**Using Canva Pro:**
This type of account is a paid Canva account. You would only have access to this type of account if you have a personal subscription.
* Go to canva.com; log in
    * Create a "Presentation"
* On the left-hand side of the page, click "Uploads" and upload the image
* Click and drag the image onto the slide (you might have to move it around a bit so that it automatically fills the entire slide)
* Copy and paste the image so you have two versions of it
* Place them right on top of the other
* At the top of the screen, select "edit image"
* Using "Background remover," then click erase
* Erase anything you do not want highlighted
    * You can change the brush size as well
* Click "Done"
* Right click the full version of the image (remember you have two images on top of each other!) and select "Send to Back"
* On the other image, bring the brightness down, and then "Send to back"
* This should reveal your highlighted detail
