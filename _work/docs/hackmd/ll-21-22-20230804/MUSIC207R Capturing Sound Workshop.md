## ll plan
* recording with microphones & phones
* sound quality

## what we did
We set up three stations, all geared toward helping the students understand the different microphones' sound qualities and uses (i.e., based on what/how a mic captures, when might you use it/in what settings). 

The stations were:
* Using a Zoom microphone, which they're using in their field work (MK)
    * This station involved using the Zoom in different locations (LL studio, Fireplace room, atrium upstairs)
* Editing sound (CC)
* Experimenting with different microphones (JK and CD); the students used headphones and colored cards to listen to the sounds produced by different mics and then reflected on the sound quality on cards; MK then led us through a group discussion at the end of the session, where we saw the types of qualities people noticed - this produced a lot of interesting overlap! Mics students tried out included:
    * Dynamic
    * Condenser
    * Zoom
    * Lav
