## designLab notes
* Oral-formulaic composition - poets have a storehouse of fomulas that are in the right meter and they add to that
* Jay-Z doesn't write down his lyrics! Improvises his songs.
* Chorus vs. verse
    * form and content distinction
* Rewrite a rap verse that you know by heart and tweak it in a way that makes it feel "wrong", 
    * messing with the number of syllables in a word so that it doesn't match with the meter
    *  moving it to a different language that doesn't match
    *
