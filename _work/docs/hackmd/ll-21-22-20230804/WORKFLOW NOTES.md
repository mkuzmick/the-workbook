# WORKFLOW NOTES

## INGEST SCRIPT THINKING

steps

- create card (or media-source) folders
    - should this happen from Airtable?

- counter options
    - 001 sequential
    - time to the second
    - HHMM.01 (01 sequential)

- naming shoots
  

### FEATURE REQUESTS
* counter creation--can it be automated or made easier? if so, where?
* need a good number of the "source codes" to start naming things
* to run in either a parent or child folder (for situations in which a new card for a shoot pops up later)
* peakGif
* random stills
* look for blank AMX files and remove those channels
* logging shots via autostills
* send all the autogenerated stuff to Slack channels
    * maybe central channels get everything
    * but also find a given event's key tags and send to *specific* channels
* fcpxml to airtable segments 
* fcpxml keywords to airtable tags
* airtable tags to fcpxml keywords
* airtable to fcpxml sequences
* transcode
    * rename
* m2s 
* log all to Airtable
* generate MC_CC_Ex
