Supporting Professors Jeff Lichtman and Katie Quast, Media & Design Fellow Xiaomeng Han has been developing an interview series that will be compiled into a video about the process of reading scientific papers. This project involves interviewing professors, PIs, post-docs, and students about their reading practices, asking them to reflect on how they read scientific research for comprehension. The goal of this project is to share these videos with students to help them learn how to read the academic research papers assigned in the course. Xiaomeng has completed and edited these interviews, recording in one of the Learning Lab's several studios.
