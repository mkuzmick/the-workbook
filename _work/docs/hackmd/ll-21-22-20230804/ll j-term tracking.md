# ll j-term tracking

Programs v. projects v. milestones v. tasks

Clients, Projects, Tasks/Milestones/Microprojects

Existing programs
* courses
* staff projects
* lab projects

In the media zone they are working on the following structure:
* client
* project
* type of thing

tagging system
* clients
* projects
* people
* tools
* events
* random tags

Project launch meeting is the place where we decide what we are doing, the scope of it, who is doing what.

Examples...
**Project:** Infographic assignment for PSY1845
**Milestone:** Deliver a page on how to create an infographic (and why)
**Task:**(Katie) Create a Hack.md and populate with background materials
(Marlon) Write intro on "Why Infographics"
(Christine)... 
**Links**: To PSY1845 in courses table, which is linked to Mark Hatzenbuehler, etc.

Tasks that take on the magnitude of 5-50 min shouldn't be cards, they can exist in notes
Milestone = 5-20 hours
Projects = 50-5000 hours

Is Airtable the view we want for planning? Are there views we'd like to pull out of Airtable?
Christine likes knowing what she's working on and who she'll be working on it with. Tracking collaboration.
Can Interfaces play a role? Gantt chart + Kanban???
It would be great to reinvigorate the labs channels / get folks posting more in show-your-work.
