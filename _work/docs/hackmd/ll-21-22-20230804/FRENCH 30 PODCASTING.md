        - microphones and voice
        

## SOUND & MEANING



## GARAGEBAND & AUDACITY


- French podcast
    - story and reflection

    - music beds & sound effects
        - improv activity
    - interview tips and practice
        - tips
        - research them in advance
        - have a bio and introduce them
        - why and how will the interviewee connect with the intended audience?
        - don't ask yes/no questions, 
        - or leading questions ("and so would you say that's what made the class so awesome")---give them freedom
        - aim for "how" and "why" questions
            - ask for elaboration---it's OK to be confused and to want to know (you are the listener's proxy in the room) 
        - the interview is a story, think about story-order (rather than order of coolness or importance)
        - ask one question at a time
        - don't talk over them
        - listen actively to their answers (don't just wait for your turn to talk again)
        - send the questions in advance if you can!
        - save time for a pre-interview orienting conversation if possible
        - find an interviewer you really like and pay attention to their process the next time you listen to one of their interviews

    - editing
