EALC Media & Design Fellow Kangni Huang built an Airtable database that records basic information about illustrations from an eighteenth-century Chinese novel. Kangni's goal has been to create an easy-to-use data collection of these illustrations, because key data about these illustrations is often scattered and difficult to access. This database aggregates key information about the illustrations and allows students to classify, describe, analyze, or tag the illustrations. Though this database is not currently linked to a course, the structure and content of the database could be adapted for a range of courses, especially those that want to encourage students to classify, annotate, and close-read visual or text-based materials.
