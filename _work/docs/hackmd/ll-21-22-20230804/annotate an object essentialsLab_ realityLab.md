# annotate an object essentialsLab: realityLab

## to do asynchronously before the end of the week:
Read: [the manual?](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/3dview/startup_scene.html)
Watch: 
Make: an annotated object in blender, render it, and share it. At a minimum, print out your render and put on the white board. For bonus points, create a gif of your annotated object and share to show-your-work! Please also share the blender file and any extra assets found/created. 

## during section:

These are 15 basic steps we will follow together:
1. import an object
2. scale, move, and rotate object
3. add plane 
4. add text
5. add light
6. add camera rig
7. add camera
8. add path for camera
9. add keyframes to animate
10. render to your folder
11. import into fcpx
12. resize clip duration for gif
13. export
14. run gif machine
15. share to show-your-work


## to do on your own to complete this realityLab module:
basically, we want you to make your own annotated object! One that might be potentially useful to your creative capstone prototype! Or one that you could use for a real life course you are taking! 

In any case, it will be awesome to soldify what we learned in our 1 hour blender sprint by repeating the steps--in your own time, with an object that resonates with your imaginary gened interests!

### LLUF Tips 'n' Tricks
- 'G' is Grab, it attaches the object to the mouse and you click to drop it.
- 'R' is Rotate, it attaches the object to the mouse and you can spin it around; click to finalize position.
- 'R' or 'G' with X, Y, Z lets you rotate or move on a particular axis.
- 'S' is scale, swipe up and down the mouse to make object bigger or smaller, click to finalize position. 
- 'Ctrl + P' is parent, select both objects you would like to link before
- Use 'tab' to switch between object and edit modes
- When importing an object from Sketchfab, look for 'blend', '.obj' or '.glTF' files and make sure you're on 'viewpoint shading' to see the textures (in top right corner)

- Use sites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/search?type=models), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), etc to find Blender assets. 
- you might have to scale up your imported sketchfab object
- use the hand on the top right corner to move around the screen
