# Sea Monsters Course Website and Interactive Game

Media & Design Fellow Zane Wolf built [a course website](https://seamonsters-bb334.web.app/ ) for FRSEMR 50V: Sea Monsters, taught by Professor Peter Girguis (OEB). This website is a gallery to host drawings of monsters created by students in the Sea Monsters freshman seminar. It also includes a memory card game, which encourages students to interact with the course content. The data is hosted and pulled from Firebase.
