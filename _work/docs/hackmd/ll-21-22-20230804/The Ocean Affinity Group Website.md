Media & Design Fellow Zane Wolf is building a website for [the Ocean Affinity Group](https://trusting-colden-da693e.netlify.app/). This website is being developed to support OEB Professor Peter Giurguis's new initiative. OAG connects people from various ocean-affiliated centers, departments, academic areas, institutes. To allow easy access to this information, Zane will create a People Directory. OAG also compiles a list of resources and opportunities available to researchers of all levels; for this, Zane will create an Opportunities Directory, as it can be hard to know what grants, fellowships, internships, and other opportunities exist. The data is stored in and pulled from Airtable, where people can add themselves to the directory using an Airtable form.
