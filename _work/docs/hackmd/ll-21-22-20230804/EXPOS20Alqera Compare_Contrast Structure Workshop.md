Unit 1 Assignment: Comparative & Close-Reading Essay
Essay 1 Assignment:
Comparative & Close Study of 2 Sources
Length: 3-4 pages
Draft Due: February 13, Sunday, 5 pm
In Unit I we shall look at how material and verbal art can help us reconstruct the tradition of an ancient civilization. We will explore how artifacts from ancient Greek culture can shed light on the narrative of the Iliad, a Homeric epic that was originally performed. At the same time, we will also consider how the narrative in the Iliad can enhance our understanding of these material artifacts at our disposal. Studying interrelationships between different sources is important because it can often lead to deeper insights into our subjects and their context. Our first assignment is designed to facilitate such insights. We shall see how comparing and studying two sources (literary or otherwise) can often deepen our understanding of either source. 
You may consider, for instance, how studying an ancient Greek hydria (a water vessel)  can help us better visualize and understand scenes from the Iliad.  Or you might point out how certain features in both the narrative and the artifact highlight performative elements important to an oral tradition. Since this is a shorter essay, you will only be able to focus on one or two points of contrast. Yet this is also the point of this assignment – a focus on a particular feature will allow you to delve deep into your analysis, thus enabling you to practice the art of close reading. Remember, often a comparison isn’t helpful unless you can point to specific details in either source that lead you to your conclusion. By close reading the sources, you will be able to point to specific ways and reasons why a detail is relevant, and how focusing on the smaller stuff can often help us appreciate the source overall. 
As you look for connections or points of contrast between your sources, don’t forget to keep in mind the ‘So What?’ question. The ‘so what?’ question is meant to help you get to the meat of your argument or thesis - why paying attention to a detail or feature is important or helpful. We shall learn more about developing an appropriate thesis and answering the ‘so what?’ in our response exercises due before the assignment
For this essay please choose one of the two scenes we studied and contrast it with one of the artifacts listed below.
