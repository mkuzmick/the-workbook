# Bok/CS Media & Design Fellow - Tica Lin


### Projects
Tica has worked on a significant number of projects in her time as an MDF at the Learning Lab. These projects draw on Tica's expertise in coding and data visualizaiton. Tica's projects include:

**Unity Virtual Gallery Examples & Tutorial**

Tica created a virtual gallery template that can take any images and text and display them in an interactive virtual gallery tour in Unity. Tica also developed a tutorial introducing the basics of Unity and set up a virtual gallery example project that a beginner can use as they learn the software. To make this tutorial, Tica used a codebase available on [Github](https://github.com/ticahere/ll_virtual_gallery). 
    


**Airtable in Unity Virtual Gallery Resource and Workshop**

Tica further developed the virtual gallery project to link Unity to Airtable. Tica developed a framework in Unity that directly accesses a designated Airtable base with images and descriptive text. Then, Tica demonstrated an example scene that automatically loaded the art images and descriptions from Airtable in the virtual gallery in Unity. This tutorial and codebase can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ticahere/ll_Airtable-in-Unity). To demonstrate this workflow, Tica offered a workshop in Unity to a group of Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows and Media & Design Fellows during the spring term. This gave Tica the opportunity to practice teaching a highly technical tool.
    


An example showroom Tica created early in the spring term:

**Data Visualization Workshops**
Tica discussed and planned data visualization activities with another Media & Design Fellow ,Zane Wolf (OEB), as part of their work in  the Augmenting Space Cluster, a multi-disciplinary working group comprising MDFs and Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (LLUFs). Tica led several workshops on introductory visualization design and hands-on design process. The materials Tica created for these tutorials could be readily adapted for undergraduate courses that instruct students in the fundamentals of data visualization and coding.

**SEAS Faculty Visualization Project**

Tica collaborated with the SEAS communication director to design [an interactive visualization on the web](https://github.com/ticahere/SEASVis.github.io) that demonstrates faculty and department collaboration.
    

**AR/VR development**

Tica experimented with AR applications development with the Unity Mars framework, AR Foundations, and AR Kit. This allowed Tica to test a virtual Harvard campus model rendered from Google Map through blenders in VR.
