## notes from the instructor

**2 March: Bok Center Learning Lab Visit**

The Bok Center Learning Lab provides a variety of resources to help TFs and instructors with assignment design, assessment, and use of technology in the classroom. We will work  at the Bok center learning lab for two consecutive weeks.

Today on our first session, we will meet with the Bok Center to learn about some of the projects theyâ€™ve done with music courses and courses in allied fields, and to discuss how the Learning Lab can help you with your own teaching goals. This presentation will be in conjunction with designing media rich assignments. 

Assignment: Peruse the Learning Lab website, and come to class with a draft/short description of a concrete assignment that you could imagine designing for a class of your choice. During class, we will go to the Bok Center Learning Lab and see what resources they have that can help you develop and refine your assignment. You can then, if you want, continue to develop your assignment and even test it on volunteer undergraduates at the center. This is a great option if you want to develop this for your teaching portfolio.

We will meet at the learning lab located at 50 Church St, Suite 308 Cambridge, MA 02138.

 

**9 March: Bok Center Learning Lab Visit**

On our second visit at the Bok center we will be a hands on session where we explore basic media skills like setting aperture on a camera, editing video, and editing audio. We will have the chance to work with various tools and pursue the skills needed for making a short story.

We will meet at the learning lab located at 50 Church St, Suite 308 Cambridge, MA 02138.
