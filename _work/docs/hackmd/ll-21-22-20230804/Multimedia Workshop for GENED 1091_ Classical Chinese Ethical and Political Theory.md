EALC Media & Design Fellows Juhee Kang and Queenie Luo hosted a multimedia workshop for Professor Michael Puett's GENED 1091 course, bringing students into the Learning Lab to learn about some of the tools they could use in their final creative projects. Stations were set up where students could explore 2D illustration (both virtual and digital), 3D modeling (both virtual and digital), capturing and staging performance, and video editing.
