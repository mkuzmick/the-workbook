From Jie:
* The lighting workshop 2 years ago with a focus on Rashomon was perfect if that can be repeated (i believe that was chiaroscuro lighting on faces for dramatic effect); a variation would be three-key lighting.  Other than studio lighting of a facial close-up, if there are any tips on shooting outdoors at night but keeping the characters visible or even highlighted it would be fantastic, as in many of Wong Kar-waiâ€™s films, though we only cover those before spring break:

## space and gear prep
## media prep
## ll plan
Four stations:
* Framing and camera angles (JK)
* Depth of field/focusing (CD)
    * including rack focusing as a storytelling technique and the "stay in focus challenge," where one student slowly walks toward the camera while the camera person attempts to keep them in focus (impossibly hard but they liked it!)
* Camera movement (LP)
    * including using equipment for iPhones
* Lighting (MK)

Students rotated through the four stations, having ample opportunity to experiment with different types of camera work (and generally getting familiar with using cameras and other equipment).
