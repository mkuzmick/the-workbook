# EXPOS20 Reading Museums
11/30 10:30-11:45am + 12:00-1:15pm
Preceptor: Christina Becker
Enrollment: 14, 14

## Original ask
> For the final Unit 3 capstone project, my students have to participate in an academic Zoom conference on museum studies and give oral and visual presentations on their Unit 2 research topics. In order to do so, they will have to adapt and select judiciously elements from their Unit 2 research paper to fit the scope of a brief but compelling 10-15 min presentation. **There is also a visual component to their oral presentations: they should be able to use slides in a compelling way (e.g. pithy epigraphs; captions and/or bullet points to introduce central points of argument (as needed); visual evidence in the form of clear attractive images or interactive virtual tours for their close readings of museum spaces).** Tom had mentioned that you would be a great resource on the visual component of this assignment. While I have an E-40 preceptor coming in to give some expert advice on public skills in general, I was wondering if you (or someone on your team) could possibly guide us in terms of the studentsâ€™ effective use of Zoom for their oral presentations (e.g. the balance between showing slide images via the ShareScreen function and speaking to the camera without images; criteria for how to create a compelling online presentation through the use of visuals).

* Students will be presenting to an academic audience (with an expectation that they will still define any jargon)
* Presentations are 10 minutes with 5 min of Q&A

## Plan 

* Visual presentation strategies
    * The images in their slides as a framework for their arguments (and a memory aid for them!). 
    * Offer images that are appropriate for the argument they are presenting.
* Tools
    * PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, Canva, Prezi
    * Photo editing
        * Talk about how you can alter your photos to make them work better in your presentation. (Edit screenshots, etc.)

Christina will send us the final prompt today.
