# metaproject-look-books

## basics

Beginning with Horizons, we'll work at creating visual references for projects at the outset. We'll do it for as many as possible, back at the beginning we'll priorities a selection of projects.

## workflow

* divide up into chunks that we can do in smaller chunks of time (or delegate or crowdsource)
    * references (from films, sites, etc.)
    * tutorials
    * prototypes we have created (for this or other projects)
    * microprojects involving media production that's clear cut
* make
    * permanent staff should make as many as they can (or find prior work that does the trick)
    * fellows should be invited to contribute as often as possible
    * in certain cases, we should offer fellows pop-up tutorials on the skills required (especially when these serve as workshop-practice)
* assemble--location can vary based on client
    * bare minimum for each one = hackmd with links and embeds
    * other options 
        * video montage/reel
        * canva presentation or site
        * styled website (beyond hackmd)
        * print/pdf
    * they don't all need to be identical, but a portfolio of them would be nice, so we want to be able to curate them all somewhere.
* present
    * highlight gaps between what we've done and the references to manage expectations
    * get approval and further clarity
    * if revisions are necessary get a timeline for them
    * determine final technical requirements and get these into the doc as text
* store
    * store all elements of the process in the lookbook base
        * references/models
        * tutorials
        * prototypes/ll-work
    * from slack, for now using the show-your-work ecosystem
        * tagging things in show your work and links to send to the lookbookbase
