 ### to do
 -extrude the walls and ask what's next
 -we might want to add the man bolted to the wall
 
 
 ## 20220330 - Graphics Check-in
 
 * Have Hannah's images fade in in the intro slides
     * She likes them but isn't wedded to them so if they have to be ditched that's fine
* She rewrote her introduction yesterday, the rest of the talk is the same but the structure changed a little bit.
    * She's removing the whole technology intro and it's just going to be 3 images of the same artwork.
* Hannah is going to practice time timing for the portion with the floorplans moving and the globe and will send us times by tomorrow so that we can adjust the timing of the visualizations.
* Do the globe animation and the text as a video to reduce the complexity. Would like it to end on the Tate.
