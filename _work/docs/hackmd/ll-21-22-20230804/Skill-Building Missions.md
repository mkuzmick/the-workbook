# Skill-Building Missions

For each Skill-Building Mission, we will ask you to 1) learn a thing, 2) make a thing, and 3) tell us about it so we can get qualitative and quantitative data on it. (ie. how many hours did it take you to make a donut in blender? what was the hardest hurdle to overcome? what was your favorite part of the process? How can you imagine using this new skill for a course project?). Know that your feedback will be used for visualizations and learning designs to help future fellows embarking on this activity as well as students in courses that are utilizing a similar skill set or tool for a course assignment.
* Learning a thing. Since this is largely an independent pursuit, the first thing to think about is HOW to learn. We offer 3 approaches below:


  1. Read the "Textbook" 
  2. Follow some "Recipes"
  3. Do a ton of "Studies"

* Making a thing. As you read the textbook, follow the recipes, or do the studies...post all of your updates (any models you find, your work in progress, the milestones you hit, etc.) to [#show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C)
* Telling us about it. You should be doing this a ton along the way (see above), but once you've reached a point that feels super sharable (like you have a finished donut after completing the blender donut recipe) then post to [#show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR)
