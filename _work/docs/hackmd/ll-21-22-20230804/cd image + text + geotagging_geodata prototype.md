# cd image + text + geotagging/geodata prototype

### experiments
In an attempt to develop a workflow for a project that integrates so many different modes, I started with a tool that has a very low barrier to entry: StoryMap JS. Because Kangni's course focuses on literary analysis, I chose a short story by the US writer Toni Cade Bambara as the text that I would map. This story is set in New York City, and location is important to its plot. Though the characters don't travel extensively (that's one of the implicit points the story makes about inequality and space/geography), they mention a few locations in the city. I charted these different spots and paired the geotag with text from the story and, when possible, images of the iconic store the characters visit. The draft of this StoryMap should be viewable [here](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/b8ba95b6d5d56dc7d5d417da783b40c4/the-lesson-by-toni-cade-bambara/index.html).

### challenges
StoryMap JS has limited options for layout, and it can be difficult to know where to put what type of text. Specifically, I wasn't sure where to put my analysis (or how much to even include, given the form of the map): Did it make more sense in the title of the slide, or should it be integrated into the space where I quote directly from the short story? Asking students to consider where to analyze and where to quote seems worthwhile; it could work in a number of ways, and it would be useful to think about the advantages and limitations of different options. This challenge is also why a tool like Canva might be a good option.
