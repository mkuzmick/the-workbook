### Background material
* [Class Resources](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/93282/modules) on writing about film, filming, and cameras.
* [Film Terminology Glossary](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/93282/pages/film-terminology-glossary?module_item_id=904969)
* [All weekly prompts](https://hackmd.io/3oIk4RdDS12TMa6ar8jnCQ)

### Prompt
As per Analytical Posting Option #1, instead of using frames from [To Live ](https://vimeo.com/315367317/631a41b894), use your camera to illustrate the 5 formal elements/techniques from 3 categories. You can either take still photos or make a short video (no more than 1.5 min) comprised of the 5 elements youâ€™d like to illustrate (if your video actually has a narrative that would be a plus). Also include 2-3 sentences describing what you were trying to accomplish. Upload the link to the course's Vimeo account so we can access it. A collaboration of up to 3 students is possible if you make a video. EACH PERSON FROM THE GROUP SHOULD SUBMIT A LINK TO THE VIDEO. PLEASE INCLUDE GROUP MEMBER NAMES IN YOUR VIDEO AS WELL.
