## your mission, should you choose to accept it

1. find a few images or videos you'd like to use in your final project. Feel free to use the images we've printed, but also feel free to find new images online you'd like to print or videos you'd like to display on our screens
2. think about one of the "moves" above you think you might perform in your multimodal capstone, for instance
    - an opening mystery
    - a comparison
    - a montage that reveals a pattern 
    - a "remix" of a narrative or visual trope that "applies" it to a new context
4. prototype a 30-60 second presentation of this "move" with the Learning Lab's art supplies, microphones and cameras--we'll be looking for volunteers!! 


for bonus points, prototype your presentation in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), which is a GREAT tool for whipping up [quick multimodal essays](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEteRjpVR0/gMbHRq0WwLmjfzu7yIcNGQ/view?website#2).
