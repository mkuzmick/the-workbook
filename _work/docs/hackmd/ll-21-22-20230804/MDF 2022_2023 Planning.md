# MDF 2022/2023 Planning


## essentialsLab:

**20220216**
Xiaoyi ideas:
* Instead of designing a course for the lab, MDFs could share their projects and team up if they're working on similar topics
* Liked when we presented our ideas and interests - get an idea about what everyone's interested in and how we can maybe collaborate with each other
* Brainstorming ways to collaborate - what would this look like for different groups, given the tools they like?
* Could distribute a survey before the first meeting to get data about what everyone is working 
* Using the cards reminded her of Miro - could be another tool to play with
* Really liked doing the work with cameras!
    * Procedure of introducing the camera, giving short tutorial about the lenses, batteries, cards - found this really helpful
    * Experience from practice - the more practice, the better
    * Let MDFs explore the camera without explaining how to use it - how to change the focus, for instance - give someone space to explore the camera
    * Way to introduce MDFs to the studio as well (have them take pictures of the studio)
    * Keep track of the problems they're having - if they're having trouble, say, focusing the camera, take note of that and then discuss
    * 5 - 10 minutes after they explore - have LL staff go through most important camera techniques (like focus and depth of field); have different MDFs take on this role - give MDFs an opportunity to teach from the outset
