Media & Design Fellow Claire Adams facilitated a Reinterpretation of a Paris '68 Poster or Photograph Workshop in support of Mary Lewis's course, "Empire, Nation, and Immigration in France since 1870."" This workshop supported Professor Lewis's course assignment that asks students to "update" a historical work of political art for a contemporary audience, referring to contemporary political movements and issues in a visually compelling and legible manner. Above are some examples of student work, including a reinterpretation of historical protest imagery that addresses the gilets jaunes ("yellow vests") movement.
