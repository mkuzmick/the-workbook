# Bok Support for GENED1001: Stories from the End of the World

## About the LL
The Learning Lab team collaborates with Harvard faculty to explore, design and build materials, assignments, and activities for Harvard courses. These activities often involve unconventional modes of communicating, making, and creating – including data visualization, film-making, public speaking, 3D modeling, virtual reality, sculpture, dance and performance, and public service, among many others. Since students will often be engaging these media and tools for the very first time, the Learning Lab provides direct instruction to students through workshops and hackathons hosted in our Learning Lab Studio, a flexible space with dynamic technological capabilities and artmaking supplies.


## Support in Fall 2020
Last year we delivered three optional workshops for GENED1001 students and shared recordings for asynchronous viewing:

1. Audio (including spoken word, podcasting, and music recording)
[See workshop and materials here](https://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1001/001-audio-authoring) 
2. Video (including video and animation)
[See workshop and materials here.](https://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1001/002-video-authoring)
3. Web-authoring (including things like an interactive photo essay, map-based interactive of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a web-based game, a website of a space station museum devoted to the history of the apocalypse 200 years later, a gallery, a countdown site to the apocalypse, etc.)

## Future Directions
* Organizing the workshops
    * Last year LL staff gave workshops on audio, video, and websites, but it might be useful to think about what the common student final projects are and if these 3 workshops meet student needs.
    * Elitza could help to staff workshops (LL staff would support the technical tools but it’s great to have a course presence there, and to get help with student sign-ups and course logistics)
* Help curating the materials after the course has run into a website or database
* A write-up of the project, reporting on our involvement
* Think about implementing scaffolding activities (that can be ungraded, section activities)
    * Visual Analysis Activity Ideas
    * Assign a gallery tour looking for hidden apocalypses in the HAM
* Language to help TFs and students respond to creative projects. (Grades are based on the Artists statement.)
* Record students giving an oral artists statement where they show their visual projects and walk us through it at the Learning Lab Studio.
