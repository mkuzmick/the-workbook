## this week happenings

### show and tell plan

Christine and Marlon met up to plan out a show and tell plan for Spring 2022. Sounds like we'll go with two main channels: `#ll-show-your-work` will be for images and quick notes documenting our work, of the sort you might post 5-20 of in a day (and it will send you markdown to embed what you wrote). `#ll-show-and-tell` will be for longer, blog-post sized explanations of your work (its significance perhaps, or something interesting you discovered while doing it, or instructions on how others can create something similar, etc.)

## last week's happenings

Behind the images: Marlon is working on a Slack channel and connected Slack app that will take images sent to it, develop a public link, and Slack you the markdown to make it easy to embedd. The images below aren't neccessarily the ones we'd select...they were what was in the Slack channel this week. Luke's is great, the workshop overhead is cool, the screenshots should try to become a particular aspect ratio. 

### Brick Room Studio

Luke developed a new studio setup for the brick room!
