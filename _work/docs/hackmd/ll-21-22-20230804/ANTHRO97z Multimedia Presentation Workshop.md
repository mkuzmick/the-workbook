## what we did
Using Canva, we designed a scrolling website for the course: http://anthro97z.learninglab.xyz/

Slides included information about:
* office hours when students could come by the LL for further support as they created and edited their audiovisual projects
* a link to the help.learninglab.xyz form so they could ask questions and receive resources from us
* a "microtip" about storytelling (i.e., the idea that their audiovisual projects should tell a story of some kind and that many stories use defined "shapes" or "moves" - like from tension to resolution)
* a list of resources they could use to edit visual and audio assets

Students asked questions about the types of software they could use as Harvard students, and Casey pointed them in the direction of Adobe and Canva.
