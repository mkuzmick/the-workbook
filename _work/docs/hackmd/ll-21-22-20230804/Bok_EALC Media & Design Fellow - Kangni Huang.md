Kangni assisted Professor David Sena (EALC) in the production of a short video about the 100th anniversary of Chinese language instruction at Harvard. Kangni brought Professor Sena into the Learning Lab to film this short video. Then, Kangni edited the footage into a short film. This film will be used to promote language instruction at Harvard.


**Chinese Literature Illustrations Database**
During the fall term, Kangni worked on an Airtable database that records basic information about illustrations from an eighteenth-century Chinese novel. Kangni's goal has been to create an easy-to-use data collection of these illustrations, because key data about these illustrations is often scattered and difficult to access. This database aggregates key information about the illustrations and allows students to classify, describe, analyze, or tag the illustrations. Though this database is not currently linked to a course, the structure and content of the database could be adapted for a range of courses, especially those that want to encourage students to classify, annotate, and close-read visual or text-based materials. Many humanities courses, for instance, could use databases like Kangni's to encourage students to see the classification of materials as an analytical exercise. When making a database, one has to make choices about how and why to present information about a given text or illustration. Moreover, creating a database involves careful planning and revising, so it has analogues to writing an academic essay as well.

**Virtual Postcard**
Kangni developed a text-image-geotagging/geodata project that had students enrolled in CHNSLIT 280: Shanghai and Beijing: A Tale of Two Cities record geolocations for different settings featured in the course's literary texts and films. Using a mapping tool, students paired a geographical location with an image and some text, producing a kind of "virtual postcard" that details the real-world locations featured in the source text. Kangni's goal was to help students visualize urban space and integrate it into textual analysis exercises in creative ways.
