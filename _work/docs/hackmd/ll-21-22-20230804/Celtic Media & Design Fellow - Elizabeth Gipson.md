* **Storymaps Project for Celtic 111** - Elizabeth developed a demonstration in this mapping tool that she delivered as a a class presentation. Elizabeth also provided individual troubleshooting for students who were perhaps new to mapping and the types of data it requires.
* **Podcast Project for Celtic 188** - Elizabeth created a rubric and general resources about podcasting for students in Celtic 188 to refer to as they created their podcasts. These types of resources help students gain familiarity with technical tools like GarageBand and Audacity. 
* Course trailers and other resources for **Celtic 111, GenEd 1097, FolkMyth 111, GenEd 1074, Welsh 128**. Course trailers help Harvard College students learn about courses as they determine their schedules for the term. 
* Elizabeth has also worked on course site redesigns for **Celtic 111, GenEd 1097, GenEd 1074**

**Pronunciation Database**
Elizabeth has developed a pronunciation database for the department.

**Student Resources**
Additionally, Elizabeth created proof-of-concepts for a number of projects that could eventually be used for course websites. Elizabeth created a Storymaps rubric, resources page, and demo for Celtic 101, as well as a set of timelines/graphics for GenEd 1081.
