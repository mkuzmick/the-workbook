![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F039NAZKPEH/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=d7213947e8)

## the basics

* we will have a quick meet up in **May**
* we will have a series of formal training workshops in **August** (which you will be paid for)
* over the **Fall and Spring** terms, there will be a mandatory meeting of all MDFs every other Friday
    * in the early part of the Fall, we will encounter many of the "LL Basics"
    * we'll also do a quick show and tell
* over the **Fall and Spring** there will be weekly "Lab" meetings related to some of the major media, tools and projects we work on. These will be determined collectively, based on the projects we need to support, but you can get a sense of the entire array of labs we've had over the years by checking out the slack channels for the labs that are still active asynchronously:
    * [music-lab](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C3SKHT00Y)
    * visual-essay-lab
    * cine-lab
    * [code-lab]
    * [visual-essay-lab]
    * [graphical-abstract-lab]
