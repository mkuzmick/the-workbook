## PROJECT BASICS

### SUMMARY

The goal will be to produce a workflow and some templates for the yearbook, and for this to be an example of something we can produce for a course as a template for aggregating and curating student work, reporting on the events of a course (from intro workshops to final projects), or for producing portfolios. In addition, we will develop our internal skills around scripts and automated web development and produce resource guides for future fellows or students to use to create similar web based portfolios, etc.  


### RATIONALE 
We often encounter interest among faculty, graduate, students, and indeed our own LL fellows who aspire to produce an external facing web prescence around their research or academic pursuits. Additionally, we desperately need to imporve our data-to-view options and workflows. 
* the skills involved in aggregating and displaying these yearbook assets from airtable to a web-based platform are valuable across a wide array of LL projects, so it's an opportunity for internal skill-building in the code and design zone
* the idea of producing portfolio-type assets for individuals, courses, and departments is becoming increasingly popular among our clients, and we should create an array of models for future consults 
* we should prepare to support faculty who are assigning portfolio-based assignments in their courses (*insert examples*)


### TIMELINE



* **December 10:** Launch, brainstorm data ideas, and introduce/ begin first method tutorial
* **January 7:** Call your shot (if you're doing it for real, tell us what you're doing)
* **January 21:** Submit Prototype/skeleton Wrap/Show-and-Tell 
* **January 28th:** Launch of Full Yearbook project

#### MILESTONES

* complete [this tutorial](https://blog.airtable.com/build-your-own-custom-blog-cms-with-airtable-and-gatsbyjs/) and make a simple blog site
* decide on the yearbook content/section to prototype and create simple doc
* back end: build the airtable base to use for prototyping and publishing. and add the data.
* gatsby, build!!


### MVP

a simple gatsby site with data from airtable.

### EXTRA FEATURE REQUESTS

* site remixed in several designs 
    * front end: customize views, or build a sort of LL starter
    * options of content in multiple gatsby starters
    * workflow options for other web builders
* scripts for automating steps in the workflow
* back end: eventually design way of connecting to our LL bases and automating these sorts of web-based reports.
