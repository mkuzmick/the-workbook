## SOLIDWORKS TO BLENDER WORKLFLOW

 

**STEP 1: SAVE THE MESH**

The most common extension to use is `.stl` which is quite basic because it essentially converts the meshes to simple geometric shapes which is easily read by most 3-D viewing sofwares.

**STEP 2: IMPORT .STL FILE INTO BLENDER**
Here we would need to pay special attention to the dimensions of our model, the scale and its orientation.

**STEP 3: APPLY MODIFIERS**

This stage would involve smoothing up the model and adding as many vertices as needed, adding an edge split modifier as well as checking for errors.

### Alternative Method
**SAVE FILE AS `.VRML`**

The major difference between this and `.stl` is that `.vrml` contains color while `.stl` does not. 

**Proceed through steps 2 and 3 above.**


### Alternative Alternative Method:

1. Import assembly into c4d.

2. Export as `.fbx`.
3. Import into blender.
