## notes from the instructor // notes
Hi!
 
I'd actually like to talk about changing the plan a little bit (in part because the project is clearer to me and in part because visiting in two sections was pretty hard). 
 
There are two things for the capstone project that I'm hoping to do that I would love help with, either with you all facilitating or just helping me get set up:
 
The first is helping students have a sense of the tools they might use for the creative part of their project. I came up with a list project ideas that I'll past in at the bottom. I'm encouraging students to pick something that they are either familiar with or are otherwise excited to learn, but I'd love to invite students to stretch a bit. I think this is what we'd talked about doing as a visit on the 5th. With such a wide variety of media, I'm not whether this would work as a facilitated thing, or if it would be better to give them a list of tools and encourage them to ask for help once they get going. 
 
The other thing is that during class on 4/12, I'd like the students to create lo-fi/analog/paper prototypes of their projects. I think this would be where some help with materials and facilitation would be really great. At a basic level, I don't have easy access fun prototyping materials. At a more general level, other than saying "go to it!", I'm not sure how best to get students started. 
 
For either, I think it would work better if we could stay in our usual classroom, so we could have the whole class working on the activities at once. 
 
Maybe we could find a time to talk through possibilities?
 
I'm sorry that I'm in a bit of an improvisational mode this semester. I'm telling myself that it's "just in time planning"! ðŸ™‚
 
Best,
Dave

I forgot to paste in the media suggestions. Here they are:
â€¢	Graphic: Poster, brochure, infographic, slide deck (for a specific, imagined event).
â€¢	Web-based: webpage, simulated social media feed, Wikipedia article.
â€¢	Text: Manifesto, vignette (day in the life scene), magazine feature, interview.
â€¢	Place-based: Map, floorplan, architectural sketch.
â€¢	Time-based: Video, Podcast episode.
â€¢	Material Object: Model, artifact.
