### Workshop Outline:

There are 2 sections, each 1hr15m long, with appx. 15 students in each.

1. To prep, print out 15 copies of the guides (note: only a handful were taken so we have extra)
2. Print out the Kagen reading and cut and arrange in the "shot-by-shot" style.
3. Print out the Posters on 11x17 borderless and arrange to compare/contrast with reading layout.
4. 15 minute "lecture/discussion" on what the LL is, moves of academic essay and moves of other modes of communicating academic ideas. Emphasis on audience and visual design. Basically just follow the canva site outline.
5. students work in groups on launching their creative projects. We emphasize that poster or video are just options and encourage them to think unconventionally to reach their target audience. They work for 45 minutes.
6. 15 minutes at then end to share out their work in progress. (and for the LL to get visual documentation)
Note: we held the bulk of these sessions in the Classroom, and then went into the Main Studio for the last 15 minutes of each. we used the overhead at the main station with the key-green-paper-mechanic on either the wide shot or a HDMI-USBC hookup for the students to share their computer screen.
