# Designing a Course Website for GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory 

Media & Design Fellow Queenie Luo (EALC) has developed a course website for GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory. This website hosts students' creative projects, providing an intentory of examples for GENED 1091 students to explore as they develop their own final projects in the course.

Below is an image of **the website's homepage**.

Queenie also designed **a mobile layout** for this website so that users can access the website from their phones.

As the sub-page pictured below shows, students can watch a video of a former student's creative dance project. Having access to this inventory of former projects helps current students develop their final projects in mediums they might not have experience with yet.
