## notes from the instructor
Last semester they seemed to struggle with visuals to explain their overarching argument. If they had to explain a key term, explaining it in an elegant way.
Most students opted not to engage with their visuals.

Need help with overarching argument and explaining important elements of their arguments (key term)

What kind of preparatory elements should the submit ahead of time?
* 3-4 key terms they have to define in their papers
* Key passages from their papers
* 4-7 chunks of source
* Maybe just their annotated bibliographies?
* Select a couple of sources to walk us through on the day of
* “Create a conceptual diagram of how you’d explain wonder”

The sources of “What”
Harvard Guide to Using Sources
BEAT Analysis → They had to do source analysis for their annotated bibliography

During the session:
* Create the “gallery” of your idea - What are the 4-5 big things you want to show us? Key terms, theories, sources.
* How will you relate them to one another? This is how you lay out your slides, the structure of your presentation, how you organize the gallery floorplan. (Visual elements, slideology)
* Students should make something!
* Workshop their conceptual diagrams together
* Demo of Canva, allude to the more professional apps - why you might want to use them (10 minutes)
