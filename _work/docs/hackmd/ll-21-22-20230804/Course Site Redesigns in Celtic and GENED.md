Media & Design Fellow Elizabeth Gipson has redesigned the course sites for Celtic 111: Shapeshifting and Identity in Celtic Traditions, GENED 1097: Tradition, Performance, and Culture, and GENED 1074: The Ancient Greek Hero. These course sites aim to improve students' access to course materials and supplemental materials, such as videos and other media, that enrich their understanding of the course topics. These course sites are easy to navigate and, because they integrate different media, are an effective way to engage students.
