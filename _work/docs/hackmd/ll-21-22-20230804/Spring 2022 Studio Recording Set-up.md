# Spring 2022 Studio Recording Set-up

## Brick Room studio
* Set up to record internally, figure out how to connect it to the system
* Luke used GH5 (could use GH4), lenses: 7:14, 17.5mm
* **For 1/24:**
    * Three computer stations on the left/black wall
    * Overhead ready to capture paper + Luke's recording setup on the right/brick wall

## c300 plan
* One of them broke :(
* They are hitting the end of their dependable lifespan. Don't count on them.
* Inventory the cameras and see what's working.
    * BlackMagics have a colorcast to them but if we color grade them they should be fine.
* Buying new equipment? Maybe in the future.
* Can't trust the EF mount. :(

## Giant pcs?
* Marlon has one at his house, isn't going to bring it back until there's a plan for it.
* The capture card in it is broken but Casey knows where another one is located.

## Stage corner
* Diagram it and think about it while you're in the studio
* Stripping everything off the trusses and coiling cables

## Overall goal:
* Create "islands" each with an ATEM mini
* Each can record as its own self contained unit
* Bit by bit connect them through SDI to the constellation hubs.
