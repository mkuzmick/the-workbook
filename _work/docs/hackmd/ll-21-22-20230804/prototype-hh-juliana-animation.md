# prototype-hh-juliana-animation
Juliana is a PhD candidate in Astrophysics. Her presentation includes animations of a planet orbiting a star. 

The animation we're looking for is largely pretty simple. It is meant to illustrate the level of light that is being dimmed as a planet passes in front of a star, as well as a graphical readout of the light levels that are being measured

[you can find the original version here](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/#/2)

![Juliana's research, Harvard Horizons 2022--this visualization is from NASA](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03109STVTQ/screen_shot_2022-02-01_at_4.39.50_pm.png?pub_secret=1e25d3b600)

## the approach

there are a couple ways to do this, you can make the star yourself, or pull a premade one from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), or [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

and then finally, you'll need to rig both a camera, and your alien planet into a circluar animation -- this process will be extremely similar
