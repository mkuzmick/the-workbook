## Canva
1. Navigate to https://www.canva.com/
2. On the top right corner of your browser, click the purple box that says "Create a Design." Scroll down and select "Resume 8.5" x 11"
3. Click "Elements" on the left side bar. Then, find a basic circle in the "Lines and Shapes" section. Click the circle to add it to your canvas.
4. Resize the circle to the size of the button you creating. **add button size options** You can resize the circle by selecting and then clicking and dragging on one of the white circles in the corner. As you are dragging, the size will pop up in the lower right corner.
6. Once the circle is the size you would like, copy and paste as any as you would like to create and fit on the page.
7. Next, select "Uploads" on the left sidebar. Drag in your image(s) to upload. Then drag your image(s) to your canvas.
8. Resize your image(s) and crop if necessary. For more detailed editing, click "Edit Image" on the top left above your canvas to use "Background Remover" if necessary (and if you are on a Pro Account!). Go back to elements and search for shadow or whatever else you'd like to add to your image.
9. When you're ready to print, click "Share" on the top right corner of the screen. Select "Download" and then "PDF Print".
