# Graphical Abstracts for MCB 80: Neurobiology of Behavior

![Graphical abstracts created by MCB80 Students](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02QP7J5BQR/hhmodelgraphicabstract_simplifiedversion_xiaomenghan_20210921.png?pub_secret=fb564f1e72)

In MCB80, students are encountering scientific papers for the first time. The course introduces students to several seminal research papers in neuroscience, which Media & Design Fellow Xiaomeng Han is adapting into graphical abstracts. These graphical abstracts illustrate for students how original research in neuroscience was conducted, helping them gain a better understanding of important findings and processes. In support of the graphical abstracts project, Xiaomeng has developed a tutorial in Adobe ProCreate, a tool that can be used in illustration/graphic design projects. Xiaomeng will continue to refine this tutorial so that future MCB MDFs and TFs can share these materials with students enrolled in the course.
