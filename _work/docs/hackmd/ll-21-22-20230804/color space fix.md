# color space fix

We record and the footage gets displayed in Rec 709 but the hyperdeck is processing the footage as Rec 2020

Rec 709 has smaller number of colors within its color range (than Rec 2020)

This means that the footage becomes over-saturated

This becomes an issue in the timeline - because our overheads record and color is displayed in 2020 and our other cameras display color at 709

Depends on what timeline is set at - you can set in Final Cut the footage to Rec 709 (CC posted about this in SYW)
