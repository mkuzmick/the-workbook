# BRICK ROOM PROJECTS




## PRESENTATION STUDIO

### NEED
* to have a presentation station for zooms and presentational videos (often teaching videos) that feels a little more YouTube-ish. References include [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd), [Paul Davids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paul+davids), [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamNeely) and many more to be logged here (see first step below)
* can't interfere with overhead capture or basic work and meeting in the room
* needs to be able to run into computer (probably by way of an AMX) for Zoom, but also to record (again, AMX is probably the best fit)
* needs to have at least a couple of outputs convert to SDI to run into the SDI-based hubs and switchers
* needs great audio, in spite of the bad AC sounds in the room
* standard shot can be MCU, but we need to be able to back it out to Medium at times for demos (like instrument-playing demos you see in the music YouTube people above)



### STEPS
* collect series of references for feedback
* propose gear
* build and test
* create samples, templates and demos
* develop workshops and tutorials on using the station

## Preliminary Gear Ideas
### Lighting Ideas
* 20-inch quick-open [Softbox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXHPGZH/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_DNCAGQJYWSKSWDV8T6D8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) paired with a [Godox SL-60W](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1341997-REG/godox_sl60w_5600k_60w_white.html). 
    * There does seem to be a common noise issue with the fan from the Godox Sl-60W, but I think paired with the right mic, this shouldn't be an issue. 
    * There is also a [fan mod](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjSoqXOt_rzAhUwnOAKHZCsC2YQwqsBegQIDRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFWOAzuqk7bw&usg=AOvVaw1kMDhFwPTYpsTsHU1-Q4-N) which could be fun to try
* Led Mat paired with some sort of diffusion [Example: Neewer LED Mat](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Rollable-Traveling-Filmmakers-Photography/dp/B07R5TKVSC)
* Led Light Panel with some sort of diffusion [Example:Neewer LED Light Panel](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Dimmable-Professional-Photography-3200-5600K/dp/B01934RL0U/ref=sr_1_78?keywords=video+led+panel+2000+lumens&qid=1636468410&sr=8-78)

### Mounting Ideas
* Desk C-Clamp DSLR mount - [Neewer Desk Clamp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095BJ15LQ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_dl_0JTGS95P6W98YD76WTTA)

### Audio Ideas
* Solid budget recorder with good preamps [Tascam DR-701D](https://www.adorama.com/tsdr701d.html?utm_source=rflaid913702)
* Another good recorder with better preamps than the Tascam [Zoom F6](https://www.adorama.com/zozf6.html?utm_source=rflaid913702)
