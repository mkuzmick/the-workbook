Intro to LL. Walked through [this resource guide](https://hackmd.io/vLlsUIY0Sui0xPB2U9hDjQ). 

* why infographics/posters for this capstone? Why is it the best form to share your research with the women's caucus?
* look at models of research posters and governement infographics to source visual communication intuitions
* go over basic mini lecture on graphic design for infographics (embedded canva presentation)
* return to models just to reiterate points from mini lecture and provide rationale for our previous intuitions
* covered the basics of setting up a google slide, resizing dimensions for poster(File--pages setup--custom size--11x17, or given specific dimensions), adding guides (view--guides--edit guides--add one per .5 in, or by desire), wireframing basic layout (use rectangles), bringing in icons or background design from other sources, namely canva. 
* one requirement of the slides is that they have links embedded to ~40 sources which are in a google drive within the larger package they will hand to the Women's Caucus. We went over how to create a sharable link from a google file (link is View, by Anyone with Link) and how to make text within inforgraphic link to that source (command K, command V)
* they were particularly excitd about using canva and then bringing that into the google slide, so I shared a resource that the llufs recentl made on how to get canva pro via the github student developer pack.
