## Visual ideas
### 2/4
I'm just dropping a quick brainstorming email re. the visuals for my Horizons presentation. My project focuses on decoding ciphers. Often, when I present this type of material, the visuals are an essential component to enabling the audience to crack the code in real time while I talk. (It's no fun if I just feed them my solution and they can't replicate it on their own. They've got to have all the information to be able to participate solving the mystery--a bit like Sherlock Holmes.) They also have to see a verification of the solution, rather than just taking my word for it.

As a result, I usually use flying or animated letters of some kind to illustrate the solution to a cipher. You can see a rough, manually done version of this in the PowerPoint I dropped last week in the Slack channel. That cipher is a monogram, so the letters appear and fly away into the decoded names. I haven't yet decided whether I want to feature a monogram or, say, an enciphered letter in my presentation. If the latter, another cool and useful idea would be to have an animated cipher wheel--a device early moderns actually used--to illustrate the solution to the cipher. Example cipher wheel below: you spin it to create a correspondence between letter and ciphertext symbol.

### 2/10
My wheels are turning (ha!): I have an idea of what both the Mary Wroth and Mary, Queen of Scots talks might look like structure-wise. I'm going to storyboard them and meet w Emma and James. In the meantime, let me know what other visuals/photos I can provide you! If you need clearer photos, different photos, hit me up!

I've spent three years with this symbol, but what you were saying about how the design creates the overlay effect is making me look at it closer than I ever have: it really has been engraved to give the impression that the overlain parts of the letters have been embedded in the ones below. See the little engraved "cracks" emanating outward from where the R's diagonal bar overlays the other letters? It's like a mini-meteor impact.

### 3/1
Hi @marlon, I wanted to touch base on the monograms in my presentation: I've decided to present only the third one (in GDrive, the one named "Replica"). This one decodes to "ELIZABETH" and "MARY" as my storyboard shows, and those are the letters that will re-arrange themselves into the animated cipher wheel. Could I come in sometime tomorrow to conference with you about visuals? (edited)

### 3/15
Details about animation:

1. Start with the wheel in a wrong position
2. Rotate the inner wheel to the correct position
3. Highlight the first symbol on the wheel
4. Below the wheel, have the letter "M" flip to reveal the symbol that corresponds with it
5. Highlight the next symbol/letter pair (wheel doesn't move, locks in position)
6. Continue highlighting/flipping until "MARY" is revealed
