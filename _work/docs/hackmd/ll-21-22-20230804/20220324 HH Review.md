# 20220324 HH Review

Work to be done this week.

## Chika
Note: An asset review meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday 3/29 at 3pm
- [x] Run a bleach bypass filter on [the original flag/gavel picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M23RN3XZuUynE7loxUVQMdQbjsKSa99c/view?usp=sharing) for Chika's review ([done](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C0301GWJETA/p1648147314361629?thread_ts=1648136093.158769&cid=C0301GWJETA))
- [ ] white/black election effects graph (fix title parenthesis)
- [ ] red-scaled racial bias map (fix positioning of legend title)
- [ ] Centering/cleaning up formatting on various slides
- [ ] First montage - Practice the section with the montage and let us know about the timing. We can cut things to match your speaker notes. Let us know anything that feels a bit off.

## Harry
- [ ] Ah so for the Zoom, I was thinking of an effect between slides 7 and 8 where text would disappear and it would smoothly fade/zoom “out” to the microscopy images - essentially as if we’ve gone from proteins and zoomed out into the cell microscopy view.
- [ ] I’m thinking in the transition, there would be no text, but I would be able to talk the audience through that we were looking at proteins before and are now looking at individual bacterial cells - I tried the Zoom transition but it didn’t quite hit what I was looking for (unless there’s another function I missed entirely!)

## Vanessa
Note: Vanessa is coming in during the afternoon of 3/24
- [ ] Slide 4: Realign final positions of moving letters (MARY/ELIZABETH) so that they end up lining up with each other. VANESSA will do this! (Question: change font to Shakespearean First Folio?)
- [ ] For VANESSA: adjust the close-ups of Mary's letter to the Bishop of Ross so that it aligns with the quotation.
- [ ] Slide 13 onward: For VANESSA: insert Houghton video footage and final coded message slide (should become slides 14 and 15).
- [ ] Have Vanessa re-draw the cipher on final paper
    - [ ] Photograph it under the document camera in the LL, process and send to GSAS.

## Juliana
- [ ] Exploded telescope - Marlon + Juliana + Xiaoyi (in progress)
    - [ ] They have asked for the cross section
- [x] Animating light bouncing in telescope - Casey (in progress 3/24)
- [ ] Animating from one visualization to the other - Casey + Marlon

## Hannah
- [x] Map of the world with museums marked - Joey (in progress)
    * Joey's file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mkKKV7C3g-cLjWl-a6BtjQE_bcb1Aq2R/view?usp=sharing
- [x] _Extrude walls - Marlon_ (nice to have)

## Nicolo
- [x] Geography w/ particles - Casey (in progress)
    * White on black map w/ particles
    * Particles shouldn't oscilate up and down, try using motion blur tail
    * It's possible that we'll need to put all of the elements together for Nico, but he has everything he needs to put it together in Keynote.
- [ ] _Volumetric animation - Marlon_ (nice to have)
    * Cheat the particle colision with a cone


# 20220321 HH Review

Work to be done this week.

## Chika
- [ ] First montage - Practice the section with the montage and let us know about the timing. We can cut things to match your speaker notes. Let us know anything that feels a bit off.
- [x] Slide 3 US Prison Total
    - [x] Work on the contrast between the grey and the “Steepest rise in US history”
    - [x] Cheat the graph to the left so that the slide is centered
- [x] Working montage
    - [x] Cut to what he’s looking at on the look
- [x] Econometric slide
    - [x] Make the red of the dots a bit brighter - is the contrast high enough? Just the dots, not the line. Note that Sanders will be even LESS contrast-y.
    - [x] Adjust the alignment of the graph. Choose one spot on the keynote where the graphs live.
    - [x] Center the axis titles, Log points on the y-axis isn’t centered with the line below it.
    - [x] The title can stay left aligned, but make sure it matches throughout the presentation.
- [x] admissions - 2 graphs side by side
    - [x] However dots are handled in the previous slide, match them here
    - [x] Vertical line for time of election for both graphs, should match previous graph
    - [x] Y axis 0 should align at zero. X-ais put in a line at 0 (to represent)
- [x] Map is still in progress
    - [x] Start with the map
    - [x] Dots representing racial makeup of the US (7 white people for 1 black person)
    - [x] Dots representing that the prison population is equal
  * ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F038231NBQD/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=acb9a8fede)
- [x] Election effects - After this slide there would be a slide that covers the election effects of black and white defendents.
    - [x] Now returning to election effects, for both black and white defendents there is an election effect.
    - [x] [the graph to rebuild](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szycvYaV1Q1BVczmdPpJTtqZGASsT7N-/view?usp=sharing)
- [x] Final montage
    - [x] Use the same timeline graphic from before, but this time forward it to the present
    - [x] Hold on the flag for a while. Make sure the slide ends on that video so that is goes to black on a push.

## Nicolo
- [x] Geography w/ particles - Casey (in progress)
    * White on black map w/ particles
    * Particles shouldn't oscilate up and down, try using motion blur tail
- [ ] _Volumetric animation - Marlon_ (nice to have)
    * Cheat the particle colision with a cone

## Hannah

- [ ] _Extrude walls - Marlon_ (nice to have)

## Vanessa
- [x] Slide 2: replace static image of cipher wheel with cipher wheel animation, continuously spinning (QUESTION: do you need to know the duration for which it needs to spin?). Impose animated wheel on the image of the book page already on the slide, if possible. (JK)
- [ ] Slide 4: Realign final positions of moving letters (MARY/ELIZABETH) so that they end up lining up with each other. VANESSA will do this! (Question: change font to Shakespearean First Folio?)
- [x] Slide 5: Add animated cipher wheel to right side of slide (to remain there until slide 7). (JK)
- [ ] For VANESSA: adjust the close-ups of Mary's letter to the Bishop of Ross so that it aligns with the quotation.
- [x] Slides 5 and 9: Fix the Shakespeare Folio font so that the tops of the letters aren't cut off.
- [x] Slides 10-12: Finish the spell decoding animation. (JK)
- [x] Slide 13 onward: For VANESSA: insert Houghton video footage and final coded message slide (should become slides 14 and 15).


## Juliana
- [ ] Exploded telescope - Marlon + Juliana
- [ ] Animating from one visualization to the other - Casey + Marlon
