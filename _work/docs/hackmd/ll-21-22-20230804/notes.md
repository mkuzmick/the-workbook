Vanessa
* fix first cipher animation-she used an older one
* do we want the large animations of the embroidery?
* the video looks yellow -- is it meant to pause on the book binding, or go to black? we can either adjust the lights (but makes stage smaller looking, or we can adjust video settings perhaps?)

Nicolo
* should atoms be more visible?
* what is up with the opactity glitch?!?!!
* take out black slide?
* fix alignment of red n on right stack

Karina
* *it's a little hard to hear her*
* make globe a gif

---

red and yellow on cipher wheel

make fade to darker grey


Harry

can we add some transitions

ont he one slide, maybe have less information (do we need to see the diagrams here? maybe we can see things sequentially. but if your committee is good with it, so are we!)

choose one font weight or two at most. maybe hold on just the graph and letting us see just that for a moment 

gender neutral here?

Hannah
replace intro

stacking??

the fade from gallery to floor plan with opacity

are transitions (either appear or dissolve) intentional?

work on alignment?

mk thought she was ending on the globe.

Nico

convert gifs to be transparent background/ or just remake it in keynote

fix map, fix logo, stuttering in render-talk through simplifying this--or we can create some flattened video files taht don't have the troublw of playing back so many multiple gifs at once.

get viedo of him working-do smoother tour

cycle through as many as you can of the images

at end, have sterile neutrino be the star


Juliana

replace Sun-lik Star with our animation of two stars
