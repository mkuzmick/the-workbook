One of our MDFs, Ignacio Azcueta, from Romance Languages and Literatures has developed a podcast workshop for Professor Adriana Gutiérrez’s Spanish 50: Creative Writing and Performance course. This podcasting workshop brought students into the Learning Lab space to create podcast episodes about the course materials. Students received instruction in sound capture and editing, as well as the basics of podcast structure/form.
