### OEB 52: Single-Serving Flip
##### Faculty: Missy Holbrook
##### MLV Fellow: Morgan Furze
Professor Holbrook is experimenting with flipping the classroom by beginning with a single class’s content. This will involve about 60 minutes of modular video content to be paired with a related in-class drawing activity that builds on both the content and the modes of visual explanation found in Holbrook’s flipped lecture content.  The key to the project is the deep integration of digital content and brick-and-mortar activity — by designing the two simultaneously, in dialogue with each other, Professor Holbrook hopes to ensure that students are better able to grasp the value of flipping the classroom.

**Media, tools and literacies:** video, speaking, drawing.
**Deliverables & outcomes:** workflow innovations for lecture capture, drawing-to-learn assignment template, 60 minutes of video content for ongoing use by the course team. 

### 3D VIRTUAL CURATION
##### Faculty: Peter der Manuelian
##### Learning Lab Fellow: Lauren Santina
Professor Manuelian’s General Education course on the Pyramids has a history of innovation — indeed, the Bok Center has already teamed with the Writing Program to support the filmmaking assignments Manuelian has offered in the past.  This year, he has partner with the Bok Center to develop yet another step in the development of digital activities for students: a 3D modeling and virtual curation assignment. The Bok Center will work with the Peabody and Semitic museums to produce 3D scans and models of Egyptian artifacts, and, with the Bok Center’s training and support, students will have the opportunity to design 3D museum exhibits that put into practice what they have learned about both Egypt and museum design over the course of the term. At the end of the term, students will be able to tour all of their peer’s virtual exhibits at the Bok Center’s pop-up virtual reality stations.

**Media, tools and literacies:** 3D modeling and scanning, exhibits, curation, speaking, drawing.
**Deliverables & outcomes:** Approximately thirty 3D scans of artifacts, 3D modeling workshops and handouts, handouts on museum design, virtual curation assignment template, new models for museum-based assignments.

### HARVARD/MCGILL DIGITAL BRIDGE
**Faculty:** Emily Dolan
**MLV Fellow:** Bill O’Hara
Emily Dolan is co-leading a graduate seminar with a colleague of hers, Jonathon Stern, a professor of music at McGill University in Montreal Canada. 
of flipping the classroom.

**Media, tools and literacies:** web conferencing, back-channel chat, live streaming, classroom-design
**Deliverables & outcomes:** web-conference-teaching templates

### VIDEO GAMES AND CULTURE
##### Faculty: Helen Hardacre
##### Faculty: Alexander Zahlten
##### MLV Undergraduate Fellow: Mercedes Flowers

Professors Hardacre and Zahlten are hosting a weekend conference on video games and gaming culture intended to kick off a wide array of pedagogical initiatives related to what is fast become one of our cultures dominant modes of entertainment, storytelling, art, and community. 

**Media, tools and literacies:** game design, gaming
**Deliverables & outcomes:** the event itself, video of the event, project proposals for the coming year

### Datalore 2
##### Faculty: TBD
##### Fellow: Nadja
The initial pilot of the Datalore project was a great success, and this year the Bok Center intends to bring Harvard faculty projects into the process in a more systematic way.  The Datalore selection committee will reserve three spots for Learning Lab projects led by Harvard Faculty, and the 48-hr Datalore “hackathon” will develop initial working prototypes for each of these projects.
**Media, tools and literacies:** data visualization, digital storytelling
**Deliverables & outcomes:** three working prototypes that tell interactive stories with/about data


### MCB81 VISUAL PAPER TALKS
##### Faculty: David Cox
##### MLV Fellow: Elizabeth Graff
##### MLV Fellow: Morgan Furze

For MCB81, the Learning Lab assisted David Cox as he designed and implemented a mixed-media paper-talk assignment.

### JUST IN TIME CALCULUS FOR ECONOMISTS
##### Faculty: Ed Glaeser
##### LL Fellow: Eduard Talamas

For his Intermediate Microeconomics course, Ed Glaeser will be making a series of rough 40 short (7-15 minute) video pieces designed to give students “just-in-time” access to the basic principles of Calculus they will require in order to perform microeconomic modeling operations in Glaeser’s class.
**Media, tools and literacies:** video, visual explanation, oral presentation
**Deliverables & outcomes:** 40 short (7-15 minute) video pieces, workflow for expedient production of educational video 


### POETRY IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT
##### Faculty: Lisa New
###### LL Fellow: Emmy Waldman
In this innovative class, co-offered by GSAS and HGSE, Professor New will be teaching future teachers (be they headed for Higher Ed or the K-12 space) how to cope with the digital and hybrid “classrooms” they will encounter.  The course will meet each week at the Bok Center to practice a new mode of digital or brick-and-mortar teaching, and each participant will work with the Learning Lab to produce their final projects: a short 3-5 minute reading of a poem with commentary, a video-taped seminar-style discussion, and an interactive learning module designed to engage brick-and-mortar learners with both digital and physical media and activities. 
**Media, tools and literacies:** video, visual explanation, oral performance, interaction design,  web design, active learning
**Deliverables & outcomes:** 10 seminar sessions, support with student projects, templates for assignments and activities.

##### Faculty: Jie Li
##### Faculty: Jennifer Roberts
Faculty: Carrie Lambert-Beatty
Faculty: Laura Frahm
##### MLV Fellow: Stephanie Lam
###### MLV Fellow: Lindsey Lodhie
To support the wide variety of video and filmmaking assignments that take place across the curriculum, the Learning Lab is partnering with key courses (East Asian Cinema, The Art of Looking) and key departments (chiefly Visual and Environmental Studies) to offer increased support, teaching materials, workshops and events designed to elevate the quality of these assignments across the curriculum.
**Media, tools and literacies:** video editing, photography, filmmaking, visual thinking
