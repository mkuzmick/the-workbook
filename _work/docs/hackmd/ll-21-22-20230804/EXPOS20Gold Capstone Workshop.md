**EMAIL FROM AJ 4/18:**
As for Thursday:
My students are just now starting to conceptualize their capstone projects ([assignment attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YeB_6gQHU_1kreZ-U1HIHo_jFAZSPrGW)) in which they’re asked to create a social media channel that collates their research projects. They’ll have turned in drafts of the research paper already. I’m also planning to give them their capstone groups and a little bit of time in class tomorrow (Tuesday) to start to think about what they want to do.
 
Over the past couple of semesters, most groups have defaulted to creating Instagram accounts, because that seems to be an easy default with Canva ([past samples here](https://sites.google.com/view/capstonefall2020/home)), but I’m hoping our visit to the Learning Lab will inspire them to incorporate some additional multimedia options or consider alternative (a short video series, podcasts, etc. which groups seem reluctant to do) that could stand on their own or even get creative with how they make their Instagram content (rather than just text carousels. I think they’re reluctant both because it seems really time consuming and also because they might not technically know how to go about doing something more complex, which the Learning Lab is ideally set up to help them do. If they see that there are not only options, but that maybe the LL can help them create some of the content they want to produce, perhaps they’d be more inclined to do it.
 
I think previously we had discussed having “stations” of a sort that students (in their groups) could go around to and showcase a couple of interesting multimedia options for presenting information in a dynamic way.
