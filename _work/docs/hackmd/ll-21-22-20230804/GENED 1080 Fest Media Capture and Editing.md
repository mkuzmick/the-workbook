# GENED 1080 Fest Media Capture and Editing

During the fall 2021 term, GENED 1080 hosted a festival that showcases student projects. Working with the LL team, David captured the event on film. Using this footage, David intends to create an updated promotional reel for GENED 1080 Fest. Depending on the quality of the interviews conducted on camera during 1080 Fest, David might also produce an interview compilation.
