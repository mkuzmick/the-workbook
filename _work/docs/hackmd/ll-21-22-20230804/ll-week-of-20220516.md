### new things

Last term we had "project launch" meetings to go through all of the newly emergent projects and get them into Airtable etc. But let's just do this on Mondays--at least in the Summer or until we get overwhelmed with schedule-handling in this meeting.

* proxy workfloww: this is a good project to connect to if you are interested in technical aspects of video production, scripting for media pros, workflows for giving fellows access to large amounts of footage to edit, storage and file distribution challenges, etc.
    * MVP => drive of everything Jessi wants Jessi
    * next => drives of LLUFs for JK and MDFs for Christine (and plan for adding to them)
    * ultimately => automation model going forward and plan for going backwards
    * test unlinking and relinking in all possible ways in both FCPX and Resolve (Premiere too?)
    * add to simple-ingest base? or just build into complex-ingest base for 22.2?
* ideas for final purchases of the year before end of May
    * if there's anything you'd like us to get before year's end, just let Marlon know (with a rationale for why we need it and explanation of where we'll put it)
* NAHSP: We'll be doing a one day activity for a group of high school students during which they'll make a live explainer video (based on some basic scientific principle they learn in the first week of their program) . . . the video elements are also of interest because their capstone project is a video
* Med School SciComm course. Won't happen until J-term, but they may connect in the summer.
* updates on multimodal communication for grad students (expanded-ish Horizons-ish stuff)
    * using things like today's consultation
    * allowing MDF work in this zone (and how to do this)
    * materials
* storage reorganization
    * step 1 = fill unfilled and inaccessible or undesirable volumes with things we don't desire to access
    * step 2 = think about larger scale mapping of zones that will make sense to users
* the resources 22-23
    * summer work on handouts and other materials


### Staff particularities this week
* Casey out starting Wednesday (Chicago!), returning Monday
* Christine out Friday (for her graduation!)
* Luke working from home Wednesday and Thursday

### Events
to prep, staff, order food, document
#### Tuesday 11:00am-12:00pm NAHSP @ LL
* JK, CD, DD will be on site & MK will likely zoom in for part of it
* should check in with MK about the context
* MDF space set up should work for this meeting - just want to show them that they can have 4 groups of students working and then a presentation zone, and then the green screen area where students can interact
#### Thursday 4:00-5:00pm - MDF Welcome
* stations that get them to mix in smaller groups; personality tests!
* DD will order food (Instacart happy hour like food?)




### Media Capture & Delivery
* editing:
    * all week long ingest and turn around student project media as soon as possible (anything for longer-term projects can wait when necessary)
    * selects from Aysha's event?
* studios:
    * keep brick room set up
    * keep podcasting rooms set up

### Office Hrs
* wrapped last week?!

### available tasks for LLUFs and MPAs and others!

* daily
    * clean all surfaces in main studio
    * clear all whiteboards of anything not helping us aesthetically or intellectually
* create right-sized button magnet labels for shelves of the orange cabinet (identifying contents)
* for MPAs: check mic position and levels each morning
    * partially about just understanding the signal flow
* make sure all drop-down power cables are back up in the their orange spring pulleys
* run one of the little industrial yellow power strips to each table (hiding the cable run--can sit on a shelf under the desk)
* either screw the shelf to the bottom of the 30x48 table closest to the white shelves or just get rid of it (assuming it's structurally sound without)
*
