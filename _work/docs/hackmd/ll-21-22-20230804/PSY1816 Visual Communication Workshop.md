# PSY1816 Visual Communication Workshop


## PREP

* print the article in multiple copies
* print some larger versions of the figures and trim (same as for a film workshop)
* put a well-organized layout of creative instruments on the table (like as organized as medical instruments before an operation, but mostly crayola, really hitting that intersection of structural precision--even severit--and playfulness)



## ELEMENTS
* welcome
* invite instructor to set up the final assignment
* today we're going to think about visual explanation, facing the challenge of explaining some of the difficult elements of the article you all just read
*
