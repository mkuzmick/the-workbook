# JK + CD focus experiments

### 20220124: Focus Experiment No. 1
Jordan and Christine, led by Casey, developed an exericse in rack focusing, where the camera shifts focus between two objects in the frame. In the gif immediately below, if you look closely you can see the focus shifting from the tulle to Jordan and back to the tulle again. When Jordan filmed Christine, she focused first on the paper as Christine pulled it from the shelf, then bringing Christine's face into focus. Marlon then edited a still of Jordan in Ps.
