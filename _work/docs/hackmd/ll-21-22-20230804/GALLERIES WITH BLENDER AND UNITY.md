# GALLERIES WITH BLENDER AND UNITY

## PROJECT BASICS

### SUMMARY
Using 3D modeling tools like Unity and Blender, we'll design a proof of concept for a virtual gallery (Unity) and the objects that might populate those galleries (Blender). 

Blender is an open-source software that allows you to create 3D objects and animations; for the purposes of the virtual gallery project, it's useful to think of Blender as the software that will allow you to design the objects that will be displayed in the gallery (e.g., works of art). Unity is a great way to design and model an immersive 3D space. One way to approach this project is to have two groups: one group will work on making the objects and elements that will populate the virtual gallery; and one group will create the gallery space where these 3D objects can be imported and displayed.


### RATIONALE 
We have already provided workshops for courses that ask students to create virtual galleries; most recently, we hosted students from GENED1044, which Claire Adams (MDF - History) supports. 

Additionally, we can offer virtual galleries as a possible assignment when consulting with faculty, providing interested faculty, who might be unfamiliar with this form, with models, tutorials, and other resources compiled through this proof-of-concept.

Generally, virtual galleries readily lend themselves to: 
* displaying objects that students are studying/analyzing in a course
* introducing students to the basics of 3D modeling that could be used in an array of educational and professional contexts (i.e., to design a particular space, a building, or an object with a particular audience in mind). 
* showcasing student projects

In addition, it is worthwhile to develop a workflow that uses one of these tools (Blender) in order to create something that is ultimately intended for the other (Unity), because this process helps learners understand the tools' wide-ranging functionality and possible applications. Completion of this project will also likely require using Airtable, encouraging participants to augment their understanding of databases and turning data into a particular asset or form that is accessible for many different audiences.

### TIMELINE
* **January 7:** Call your shot (if you're doing it for real, tell us what you're doing)
* **week of January 24:** Wrap/Show-and-Tell 

### MILESTONES
* week of Dec. 13: 
    * find models of gallery spaces/layouts you'd ideally replicate in Unity (i.e., find images of actual or virtual galleries)
    * LL team: work on stage plans in Blender
* week of Jan. 3: complete a tutorial in Blender or Unity (e.g., Blender Guru)
* weeks of Jan. 3/10: tutorials at LL
* week of Jan. 10: find models for your object/space(?)
* week of Jan. 10: plan/sketch the object or gallery space (or start making your objects and gallery; share at the end of the week what you've created)
* week of Jan. 17: create object or gallery
* week of Jan. 24: objects and gallery combined!
    
**Throughout**: take notes as you go to create a short tutorial doc (i.e., Here's how I learned how to do create this object, this gallery)


### MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)
A small virtual gallery or a couple of 3D objects with a short (e.g., 1-page) tutorial about the process of creating it.

### EXTRA FEATURE REQUESTS

Data vis + maps stuff - is there a way to integrate these into the virtual gallery? Ideas?
