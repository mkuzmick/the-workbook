### 2/24
I think a “cell backdrop” similar to that seen [around 0:20 mark in this video](https://vimeo.com/383189400) would be great,
also perhaps a generic “person” icon that was less gendered than the ones I used in my slides (maybe something in the area of the attached?) in gray, green, and red (green and red similar colors as those used in my slides, and gray, maybe something like #D3D3D3)
