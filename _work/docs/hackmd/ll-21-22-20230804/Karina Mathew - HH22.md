Hi @marlon, I'm sharing 2 mock ups of slides that I'm considering, and might need more advanced animations than the ones I have. I've modeled them on Canva, and I'm still deciding between the two, but wanted to share to put it on the team's radar! https://www.canva.com/design/DAE4FlbFHIY/IRq3CsjdAtv-Hwz7SvX3UQ/view?utm_content=DA[â€¦]tm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton
For the first slide, I'm looking for a circular image to fade in that looks like this:

For the second slide, I'd like the title of the sci fi book to "grow," so have mossy, fungal, vine-like greenery emerge.
