# Maps in the Humanities Database and Gallery

Media & Design Fellow Juhee Kang is collaborating with Professor Si Nae Park (EALC) on Maps in the Humanities, a collection of maps created by scholars in the humanities. This project includes: analyzing the range of their definitions, utilities, and scopes; and building a reference site for maps that provides not only the maps themselves but also legends specific to each departmental usage. Juhee wants to add information about what kind of technical skills may be required to make something comparable to this reference site.
