## media prep

### Canva
* home page = "creative assignment support"
* then 7-10 pages of different media and tools, embedding examples or tutorials, with a little text to the side
    * explaining the medium in a sentence or two
    * listing the tools associated with it
    * indicating the help we can offer and maybe the appropriate office hr?
   * the media =
        * virtual web galleries
        * 3D modeling of coins
        * 3d scanning and printing
        * sketchfab embed
        * podcasting
        * interactive maps and timelines
        * curating educational websites (Canva)
        * graphic design and layout for print
        * infographics
        * illustration/drawing
        * digital art
* for each of the above:
    * embedded example or tutorial
    * paragraph of text
    * what tools do I need?
    * where do I start?
    * LL open studio?
        * W 9-12 Drawing/Illustration/Infographics/Canva
        * Th 9-12 Blender/reality
        * F 2-4 Audio/Video podcast work
        * F by appt = video artists' statements or other videography
* prompt for the activity:
    * What exists between the materiality of a minted coin and contemporary digital currencies like Bitcoin? What can we learn about value and exchange by creating "coins" of our own? At the Learning Lab, you'll have the opportunity to reflect on these and other issues as you use printed versions of the coins of your choosing to do an informal presentation. You will have the chance to record a video artists' statement about your coins in our studio and then make a button "coin" of one of them. You might think of this informal presentation as a kind of gallery tour of your coins!
* contact info for general media help
* links to resources
* invitation to return for final reflection or other media capture/production

## ll plan

1) short podcast series (quite a few students)

2) curation of educational "websites", multimedia (including galleries that the ones one can produce with CANVA, timelines etc.)

3) 3D Scanning and/or printing of coins 

4) 3D "minting" /replication of coins and trade objects with other materials (clay, magnets, etc.)

5) digital galleries/curation of objects

6) some of our students are designing a children's book on coins, and may need help designing and "publishing" it!

7) other students have expressed a desire to draw/ design coins and may be interested in knowing about other (digital) ways of rendering the images they want to produce.

8) a student has expressed the desire to create their very own NFT and discuss the process of creating and selling digital art! 
--

1. tour of media in academic and para-academic projects
2. some sort of activity thinking about an appropriate medium for (at least part of) their projects
3. share out rationales, or the beginnings thereof
4. invite them to come to the learning lab to document final versions of these rationales or other media if useful (be vague about date - TBD!)

PENULTIMATE AND LAST WEEK OF THE COURSE
MATERIALITY OF COINS, MINTING - big focus of the course; is there something in between materiality scholars and others who study something like bitcoin
-Students come during last week of course, bring highres images of objects/things they love - can see another way of minting - something beyond minting - media capture and production equipment used to help them make a magnet that reproduces a signature coin
Tell their story (at the main studio camera?)
Optional video artists’ statement - MAKE A PROMPT - send us an image of your collection of coins, we’ll print them up, you’ll talk about them using our overhead camera, give us a gallery tour of your coins, we’ll send you off with some magnets
