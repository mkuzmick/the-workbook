## PROJECT BASICS

### SUMMARY
One of the LL MDFs, Kangni, is TF'ing in the spring term for course in EALC called "A Tale of Two Cities: Shanghai and Beijing." The course introduces students to literary works that are set in these cities. Kangni is interested in developing a project for the course builds on the textual analysis that students will do. Because of its emphasis on geography and region, we decided to prototype an assignment that encourages students to explore the settings found in literary works in the textual *and* visual modes.

Choosing a passage from one of the texts students are reading in the course, we will have students create a "virtual postcard." This will include geotagging a location, assigning it an image, and writing some text that analyzes a passage from a literary work. The idea is that students "send" this postcard from the location/setting named in the source passage.

A future project could have students create a database with many passages and accompanying images in Airtable. But for now, user-testers could use Storymap JS or create an animation in After Effects, which transports the user to the location under examination.

Essentially, this project seeks to answer the question: How does a particular place matter to the story (or plot) of a given work of literature? Or more generally, how does location itself tell a story and advance our understanding of place and its significance?


### RATIONALE 

Tons of academic disciplines use map-based projects as a way to encourage students to think in unconventional ways about space, the built environment, and our relationship to it across time and in distinct social, historical, and cultural contexts. 

### TIMELINE

Make sure to **maintain a process doc** as you work!

Please share your work with the **show-your-work Slack channel** at least **three times** during your making process. Depending on your approach, you might share:
* A picture of your source (i.e., literary) passage
* Any images you will use on your map
* An in-progress screenshot of your workflow (i.e., drafting text for your Storymap, editing any images in Ps or another tool, etc.)
* Before/After shots of a challenge you faced while putting together your virtual postcard and how you overcame it
* An image of your virtual postcard in draft form (or mauybe a sketch you created as you planned it out)
* An image of your final product

### MILESTONES
* Choose a passage from a work of literature + find an image of the place mentioned in that passage. Choose your tools and start to develop a workflow.

* Develop and document workflow as you combine image/text/geodata. Why did you make what you did and how did you do it? What tool(s) did you use and why? How?

* Share your geotagged image + text!
