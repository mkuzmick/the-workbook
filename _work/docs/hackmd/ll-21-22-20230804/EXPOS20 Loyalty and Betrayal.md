# EXPOS20 Loyalty and Betrayal
11/16 12:00-1:15pm
Preceptor: Lusia Zaitseva
Enrollment: 15

## Background + Plan
- Students will be asked to bring a one paragraph pitch about what they want to write about and why it matters and a visual.
- In groups, they will find common element to think about thematically. Also teaches BEAT analysis. talk about the A or T that is the flavor of the thing that their peer’s paragraph is talking about--annotating suggestions for sources, etc.
- card activity-4 cards for BEAT. Evidence=data, that could be visual. (an image, a film poster of a traitor for example). Part of pitch could be articulating what those relationships are. 
    - Everyone comes prepared to do that, or put people in pairs and they can work on it together.
    - Have volunteers present at the end (vs. everyone! time management is a thing) in the small studio with mask off, everyone can watch in the main studio - Lusia will think about this more & lesson plan accordingly.
    - Lusia will probably ask students to come to class that day with an image
    - We’d like to at least get a photo of each map that is created

### [Plan from Lusia (v2)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQgB6LZlIJfT82BqQXf6DfegW3H0y0KQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114907127237527380532&rtpof=true&sd=true) 
## Timing
- We can move the students into a "screening room" (=the classroom), where they can watch the three sample presentations in the small studio.
- in the main studio for the entire session

## Setup + Media
* We’d like to at least get a photo of each map that is created.
* Will be using the main studio, small studio, and classroom. Video feed from small studio will need to be played in the classroom.
