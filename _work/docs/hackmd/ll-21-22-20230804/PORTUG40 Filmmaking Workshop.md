## PLANNING
[Project Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sx_YFqbVgU-ZMpCEBODhnXPuk1KhKKYwP4MmkxNxA8I/edit#heading=h.jfop1i4p6cd5)
[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_aS4-BY-N9T6BcjpMHnT81Q3l-0-MD9_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114907127237527380532&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Big Idea**: Do a small, playful activity early on in the semester to introduce basic concepts (framing a shot, making a storyboard, etc.) and explain the significance behind why they are learning in this way -- why make films.
