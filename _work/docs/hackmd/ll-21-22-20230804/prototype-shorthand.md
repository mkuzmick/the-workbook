# prototype-shorthand

## the goal: 
Develop a prototype in Shorthand that uses both image and text in service of a larger claim. Additionally, produce a "how to" doc in markdown that a student in a course could use to complete this assignment.


For more background on this project, read our [Shorthand Project Doc](/z4VZIgwWQVKTNq4VocXwew)

## the steps:
**1.** **Choose an image to analyze.** *Try to spend between 10 min to an hour on this step.* Some questions to consider as you decide:
* What features of the image are you most likely to analyze and why? 
* What views of particular details of the image provide the most evidence for the claim youâ€™d like to make about the image?
* How would you show a viewer these details?

**2.** **Check out Shorthand.** *Try to spend between 10 to 30 min on this step.*

**3.** **Build your shorthand prototype.** *Try to spend between 1 to 4 hours on this step.* Use cropping, highlighting, and other visual techniques within Shorthand to analyze salient details from your image. Develop and document your workflow as you produce ***three views of your image*** (e.g., full image, details) and write notes about its significance. Post all of your updates as you go in the [show-your-work](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02T7LNCD6C) slack channel.

**4.** When you complete your shorthand prototype, post in the  [show-and-tell](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C02SJ00USMR) channel.
