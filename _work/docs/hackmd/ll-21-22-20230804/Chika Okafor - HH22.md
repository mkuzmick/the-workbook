## Visual Ideas
### 2/8
Story
- Will plan to continue to refine his script
- He talked through script and we talked about how to help people focus on main points, perhaps reduce some detail

Visuals
- Animating graphs?
- Maps or timeline

### 2/17
Hi @marlon!  I added relevant R data visualizations that I hope can be refined and incorporated as some of the visuals in my presentation.  Would love to hear what you think and/or talk through the best way of coordinating: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uhL3ByxVq3GbaOoiQl_nD06FjSuHd7f3?usp=sharing

### 2/24
Hey @katie and @marlon, I added the source data files to the R data visualizations folder.  I also have been collecting some images, some of which will likely be integrated into my presentation: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NAVD8Xw2HplpANb9RExh6C6TzNm6x8D1?usp=sharing

### 3/10
followup on our conversation yesterday: I added three files to this folder on my google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uhL3ByxVq3GbaOoiQl_nD06FjSuHd7f3?usp=sharing

### 3/11
Two additions to my google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AsTYaxVwWbqEObYNdxWmmC-c8Vz_rKio?usp=sharing
I updated/added images in the VideoMontage_1980s1990s folder
I created a second VideoMontage folder.  A great idea I heard from my faculty mentor today was to replace the current slide 17 with a second video montage  (i.e,. replace the slide that currently has the "Criminal Justice Reform" and "Public Opinion" text to create a video montage).  This folder also includes the corresponding script I will say for that slide

# Packaged Instructions for Montage:

## What: 3 total montages.

### 80's-90's Montage
a "rewinding back in time" montage. The idea is to start with the president and rewind back in time to reagen as Chika talks about

## 20220322 Walkthrough

* First montage - Practice the section with the montage and let us know about the timing. We can cut things to match your speaker notes. Let us know anything that feels a bit off.
* Slide 3 US Prison Total
    - [x] Work on the contrast between the grey and the "Steepest rise in US history"
    - [x] Cheat the graph to the left so that the slide is centered
* Working montage
    - [ ] Cut to what he's looking at on the look
* Econometric slide
    - [x] Make the red of the dots a bit brighter - is the contrast high enough? Just the dots, not the line. Note that Sanders will be even LESS contrast-y.
    - [x] Adjust the alignment of the graph. Choose one spot on the keynote where the graphs live.
    - [x] Center the axis titles, Log points on the y-axis isn't centered with the line below it. 
    - [x] The title can stay left aligned, but make sure it matches throughout the presentation.
* admissions - 2 graphs side by side
    - [x] However dots are handled in the previous slide, match them here
    - [x] Vertical line for time of election for both graphs, should match previous graph
    - [x] Y axis 0 should align at zero. X-ais put in a line at 0 (to represent)
* Map is still in progress
    - [x] Start with the map
    - [x] Dots representing racial makeup of the US (7 white people for 1 black person)
    - [x] Dots representing that the prison population is equal
    - [x] ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F038231NBQD/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=acb9a8fede)
* Election effects - After this slide there would be a slide that covers the election effects of black and white defendents. 
    - [x] Now returning to election effects, for both black and white defendents there is an election effect.
    - [x] [the graph to rebuild](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szycvYaV1Q1BVczmdPpJTtqZGASsT7N-/view?usp=sharing)
* Final montage
    - [ ] Use the same timeline graphic from before, but this time forward it to the present
    - [ ] Hold on the flag for a while. Make sure the slide ends on that video so that is goes to black on a push.
