# Bigger Projects:
**AFVS70: Film Dubbing** 
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03BL4SJ2PM/cle__o_de_5_a___7.jpeg?pub_secret=f6c6edd2fb)
This is a project that has worked to make foreign language films accessible for people with visual impariments. Practically speaking, this involves recording the English translation into a voiceover in Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro. It requires me to pay attention to the progression of dialogue, tone of voice, and perspective on screen. Using the audio effects in Premiere, some audio was panned left or right or set into the background to match what was appearing on screen. We have dubbed Jean Vigo's L'Atalante and Agnès Varda's Cléo de 5 à 7, and will also complete Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura before the end of the semester.

**EssentialsLab Capstone Project**
My EssentialsLab Capstone Project came in two parts. for our imaginary Gened (Cities: Power in the Built Landscape), I had decided I wanted to explore the relationship between the distribution of emergency services and socioeconomic profile of a city. The first task was to create a project proposal in the form of a magazine layout. Using Adobe InDesign, I created this 5 page spread that detailed the research questions, my intended process, potential challenges or limitations and what I hoped the final product would represent.
This process was as much about learning to navigate InDesign as it was about the thinking process of how I would approach this project. It made me question my data sources, which tools I intended to use, and how I could most effectively present the information I wanted to share.

The next step was finding sources for my data; I chose to work with London because it was most familiar to me and a lot of information is available with a breakdown by borough. I found average response times for the police and fire services; response times for ambulances weren't available by borough, but I counted the number of ambulance stations each had instead. In terms of building a socioeconomic profile of the city, I found data on poverty, income inequality, child poverty and unemployment.
The next step was to represent this infoprmation in blender; I created objects for each borough, whose height was calcuated as an average response time, and each borugh was laid out in a rough geographic translation of the London landscape. This allows a viewer to compare how response times vary from inner to outer London.

This project is ongoing: the next steps are to integrate socioeconomic data and find images to visually represent each borough on the surface of the shapes.


**History of Dance on Camera**
For Jessi's Harvard Dance Project work, I researched the history of dance on camera and created a word doc with information on key events in the progression of dance being captured in media. The work included everything from Edward Muybridge's pioneering photographic studies of motion (below) in 1982 to the work of Fred Astaire, as well as Gene Kelley in Singing in the Rain (1962) and more contemporary pieces created in response to the Covid-19 lockdowns.

**Image-Geo-Text**
The Image-Geo-Text project looked to explore the settings found in literary works in textual and visual modes. I chose to work with Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, set on Burgh Island in South Devon, UK. Using photoshop, in one example I combined old maps of the island with current satellite imagery, extracts from the text which detailed the journey through the landscape.  In another, I merged historic photographs of the hotel with recent photos, integrating the appearance of how the hotel looked when Christie was writing with how it appears today. Within photoshop, this project involved manipulating the scale, perspective and alignment of these images.

**Shorthand Trial** 
Shorthand is a programme that allows you to explore images by scrolling through and highlighting / zooming into different areas. For an Art History class, I created a model presentation on Jean Ingres's Antiochus et Stratonice, including a step by step guide on how to create a presentation and a recorded video walkthrough of what this looks like on screen.

# Smaller Projects:
**A lot of button making... inlcuding "Charlie over Time" series**
I learnt how to make buttons through the *Portraits Over Time* project. this was a great opportunity to become more familiar with the button mkaing process - from cutting paper to the right size to choosing the type of back (magnet/pin/bottle openener) that I wanted my portraits to have. It was also really fun to choose different images that I wanted to represent different stages of my life.

**French30 Podcasting Workshop**
Alongside Christine, I ran a small interview workshop for students in French30 who were working towards creating interview podcasts. At first, students were definitely a little apprehensive at the thought of an interview so we began with a biref chat about what might make an interview "good" or "bad". Next, the groups split into pairs to devise a mini interview on a subject of their choice - some chose to draft some questions, others went for a more freestyle approach. Once the interview “guest” made their way into the brick room booth, however, all were quick to open up. We had some great mini interviews on everything from best Harvard houses to lego collections and from favourite cuisines to childhood memories.

**DesignLab reality tv shoot**
In preparation for Jessi's HDP film project, we devised a mock reality tv show episode. Features ranged from "pre" and "post" interviews, the learning and performance of an entire dance routine, and some fun fictional personalities.

**Exploring Photoshop through Ilya Kaminsky's *We Lived Happily During the War***
In this project, the main aim was to get to grips with photoshop a little better. I had used the programme in classes previously but not for a few years so was lacking a sense of familiarity.
This was on Friday 25th February, one day after Russian forces forst invaded Ukraine; I had read Ilya Kaminsky's *We Lived Happily During the War* in a news article. Coming from a Ukranian poet, the poem had a particular resonance with the disocmfort everyone was feeling about events that were unfolding across the globe. Meanwhile, the first images of Russian attacks were emerging online - the image of an explosion I chose to use was one of them.
I wanted to combine the deadly attacks in the background with images of comfort in the foreground as the poem describes. I used phptpshop to integrate these images togther, adjusting the lighting and perspective of the scene to fit. I also wanted to include the poem itself, and added in excerpts I'd written onto cards with emphasis on certain lines relevant to the scene I chose to portray.

 **Write up of the designLab on Focal Length**
 
 [**Lookbook for an LL Yearbook**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEwlBUmwp8/ajMqjkZXgXfPCug_ej2lFg/view?utm_content=DAEwlBUmwp8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)
 This was the first learning project Charlie took on. The tool she learned was canva, and she made a prototype of a lookbook.
