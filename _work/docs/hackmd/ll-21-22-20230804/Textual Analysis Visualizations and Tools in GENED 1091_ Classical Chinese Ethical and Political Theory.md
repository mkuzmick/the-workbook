# Textual Analysis Visualizations and Tools in GENED 1091: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory 

![A graph measuring the frequency of terms in a text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F02R3KHMYLR/screen_shot_2021-12-14_at_2.29.46_pm.png?pub_secret=1c7a24eb70)

Media & Design Fellow Queenie Luo has developed textual visualizations that help students to visually grasp key terms and concepts. 

In addition to the textual analysis visualizations and tools pictured above, Queenie has created visual materials that allow students to explore contextual and background information about the course topic. For example, Queenie is creating a timeline and map to illustrate some of the major historical events of early China. These visuals will help students deepen their understanding of how and why certain philosophical ideas emerge in particular political environments.
