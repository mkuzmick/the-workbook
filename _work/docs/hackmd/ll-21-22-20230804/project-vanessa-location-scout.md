## the details

for the shoot at Houghton shoot, there seems to be two parts that Vanessa would like to capture. a short walkthrough of this exhibit that she was a part of -- that contains a specific artifact of significance.

## choice of location

the second part will take place in one of two places -- the Hyde room or the Richardson room. a librarian will bring out a number of books/artifacts and we'll film Vanessa interacting with them

we shot in the Hyde room previously, it's quite large and beautiful. Has interesting practical lighting

the Richardson room fits the content quite well, but all the bookshelves are encased in glass

### Hyde Room
