## notes from the instructor
### Meeting notes 20220118
* He knows about Lamont's resources, his students made use of them last term.
* Interested in a session to talk about the more conceptual work they are doing - taking academic research and making it accessible / engaging. looking at examples/models together.
* He is not sure if he should continue giving them freedom or reel in to a few mediums that work really well.
* When the medium goes really far beyond the realm of academic communication (like a Twitter-based performance art piece or instagram campaign), it can be difficult. Think about where informal education/non-academic communication happens in the wild and target those mediums.
* Mediums to target:
    * Posters
    * Public education campaign - to make it work you really have to think about your audience, what you are sharing with them, have to think about it a bit more deeply than students did last term
    * Podcast

### How we can help
* Workshop touring capstone mediums (see notes about a possible theme in the third bullet below)
    * Can set up a workshop where there are stations that introduce them to a few mediums
    * Think about the rhetorical moves that are possible
    * Help them think about what goes in to producing that thing so that they aren't going in blind.
    * Make a reel of dystopian footage + print out skills. Think about how/why you'd move into another medium.

### email from Matt
Hello,

Here’s a link with all of the media I pulled for the Learning Lab Session: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxiIjb4HmTmOJmBGdh6QgikjcLITr894rIWXfAB3Rhc/edit

It’s probably? more than we need for the session, but I wasn’t entirely sure how many options we wanted the students to have for their micro-presentations, and anyway, once I got going it was fun and easy to find related media. So in the guide I’ve tried to organize by media type and give a short explanation of how we could prompt the students to engage with each type of media. Feel free to select whatever looks best or most interesting to you. And let me know if you need anything else from me before the session tomorrow.

## space and gear prep
## media prep
## ll plan

1. let's look at the "machinery" of the academic paper to start, and, in particular, at a pretty repetitive paragraph-level "move" we see again and again:
    - Print up some examples from JSTOR (articles on 1984) that have the academic text/block quote "move" in a paragraph/on a page; have 10 paragraphs maybe from 2 articles - put an installation on the wall
    - identify the pattern
    - what's happening here?
    - why do we use it so often?
    - link to "show and tell" (something we've known about since kindergarten), get the deep power of the move and its ubiquity to really land with them 
2. now let's look at some similar paragraph level "moves" we see in other media
    - serial
        - podcast "show and tell" (from mysterious audio to V.O. narration)
        - use of audio or video to "frame" or accentuate the power of a narrative or argument
    - rage against the machine
        - montage to achieve juxtaposition or pattern-revelation/recognition
    - [vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml-ZP-_e_o4) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V10kWLh71U)
        - pattern/recognition
    - apple commercial
        - remix to show how a schema, form, or concept from one domain applies to another
    - there are academic parallels here too:
        - Show and tell
        - compare and contrast
        - pattern identification
        - text in context
        - theory application 
            - adaptation/remix = narrative or trope application
        - why? (material, formal, effecient, final)
3. now let's practice.
    - in groups of 3 or so, take X media (that you select? that we surprise you with?) and develop a paragraph-sized "move" with it. You might choose to
        - show and tell
        - compare and contrast
        - show us a repetitive pattern
        - "remix" or "apply" a form to show us how it relates to contemporary content
        - add video or audio elements to an oral argument to accentuate the ideas, structure our experience of them, or connect your abstract ideas to a feeling/affect (to **move** your audience)
    - you have 15 minutes to plan out a 1-2 minute presentation with your materials. you can
        - magnet them to the whiteboard
        - place them under the overhead camera
        - get on stage to present over a music bed or accompanied by images
4. showtime
5. and don't forget our email for technical Q's, podcast/video studio time, technical Q's etc.
