## notes from the instructor
Dear Learning Lab Team,
I am thrilled to be bringing my French 40 class to you all again this term! Our visits are always the highlight of the semester.
As with last term, I am providing you a few excerpts of film scenes from movies students have watched. Just as a little background, students will have already submitted film scripts to me this week (Thursday evening) and will be completing a short assignment where they will submit a “film draft” - a two-minute segment that explores their script in film format - by the 31st. The instructions for that activity (in French) can be found here.
I think that the general format that was used last time - having students experiment with cameras, allow them to use equipment, etc. - is a great way to get them excited about filming. If there is a way for them to record their film samples at the same time, that could also be an interesting possibility. Let me know what you think and what’s possible!
