# Duets Studio 2

Where: LL Studio 
When: Thursday, April 7, 4 - 6 pm
Enrollment: 20

## notes from the instructor

20220328 Meeting
Attendees: Aysha, Nakul, Christine, Katie
Nakul and Victoria are working on videos and will be screening those two videos at the event. They are hoping to create a sort of reflective “watch party”
Space set up: Making the space into a movie theater, focusing on audio and video with one mic. Want to draw the focus to one place for the event instead of making it so dispersed.
**Would like to have good, capture-able, transcribe-able audio.**

## space and gear prep

Some kind of set up to screen the two short films the MDFs made (both films have audio as well)

Mics - the goal is to capture high-quality audio that Nakul and Victoria can easily and quickly edit after the event.

Cameras:
* Overhead
* One pointed at main studio table
* Main camera (directly facing studio table)
