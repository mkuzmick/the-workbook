# Bok Media & Design Fellow - Sarah Rosenthal


### Projects
Sarah Rosenthal is a Bok Media & Design Fellow and a HGSE graduate student. In support of LING 73D: Beginning American Sign Language IV, Sarah has been researching possible tools to integrate into ASL classrooms and other learning environments that are legitimately inclusive of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. With the assistance of Digital Accessibility Services, Sarah has learned about existing resources at Harvard, including tools like Panopto, which helps embed videos on course websites. Sarah has also explored digital collaborative platforms that allow students to work together virtually as they engage with visual media. As part of her project at the Learning Lab, Sarah has compiled a range of resources and tips for educators that could be used in different course contexts.
