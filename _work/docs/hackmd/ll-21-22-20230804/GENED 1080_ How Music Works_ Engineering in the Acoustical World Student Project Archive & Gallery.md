# GENED 1080: How Music Works: Engineering in the Acoustical World Student Project Archive & Gallery

Media & Design Fellow David Forrest has been building an Airtable database of all of the acoustic, electronic, and final projects GENED 1080 students have made from 2018 - 2021. David’s vision for this database is to make it sharable so that current and future students can refer to it as they develop their own projects. Additionally, David will analyze the data in order to identify student projects to feature. Showcasing student work in this manner is an effective way to encourage current students to be ambitious in their approach to project design and implementation. It’s also a great way to celebrate student achievement in the course. So far, David has compiled the necessary assets and converted files so that Airtable will recognize them. David also modified the assignments so that they presented well in gallery mode (e.g., giving them catchy titles, composing gallery descriptions, uploading gallery photos from the students, etc.).
