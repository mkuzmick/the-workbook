## the how

there's a sliding scale of how simple or complex the approach to this can be. although this is probably best done in After Effects. 

the first -- and easiest -- method is to arrange one image overtop of another and then crop, scale and move the top image until they are perfectly overtop of one another. at this point, you can transition from one image to the next by keyframing the opacity from 100% to 0%. 

the above method is a decent approach -- but the best method is actually to use the suite of tools After Effects offers. [This walkthrough is relatively easy](https://motionarray.com/learn/after-effects/after-effects-face-morph-effect/), although the video below has by far the coolest approach
