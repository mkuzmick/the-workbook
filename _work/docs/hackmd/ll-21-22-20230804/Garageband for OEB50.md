# Garageband for OEB50




##### 1. Import "Field" Audio
Open up Garageband and import the audio file you would like to use to in your podcast. **You can also find your own excerpt from the reading to record and import.**

##### 2. Trim Audio

Now trim your imported audio down to just the shortened soundbite you want in your podcast.

##### 3. Add Voice Over Narration
Import a recording from your phone that is crisp and clean by throwing a blanket over your head, or jumping over to another quiet room, and then airdropping to the computer to the computers. The narrative piece of this should really serve to unpack the soundbite for a general audience. Help us see the puzzle, and explain the difficulty of connecting, etc. ("It may seem weird that...")



##### 4. Add Music Bed
Choose a music bed that supports your content, your argument, and the tone you are aiming for. 

Find a moment within your podcast to emphasize with music or a sound effect. Then work on organizing your audio elements and adjusting the levels (automation) so that they blend nicely.

Check out the music beds from the media asset folder or try one of these sites:
* [blue dot sessions](https://www.sessions.blue/)
* [bensound](https://www.bensound.com/)
* [free music archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)
