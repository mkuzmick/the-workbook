# prototype-hh-hannah-animation
Hannah's dissertation research is about installation art, and specifically the many different types of workers and labor necessary to building exhibits. In her presentation, Hannah would like to have visualizations of gallery spaces. 

This prototype is likely to be fairly simple. The goal is to turn these 2d maps into 3d renders, along with some kind of appealing camera motion through the space in Blender. essentially, you'll just want to extrude the lines into walls.

in order to extrude the image, you'll need to vectorize it first -- this can easily be done in Illustrator with image trace, or the Pen tool
