## notes from the instructor
From Claire: 
I met with Mary Lewis and her TFs Clare and Lena to discuss the GenEd1160 workshops at the end of the month.  They were tentatively planning to send ~27 students who are interested in either podcasting or videos to us on April 18th.  Then they were wondering if perhaps the students could return on April 25th 3-4:15 for a more unstructured "work on your own podcast/video/map with help" meeting?


7 on monday
12 on wednesday

Repeating the same workshop on both days, though there will be 4 students attending both section.

## space and gear prep
## media prep
## ll plan

Have Jordan/Christine "pitch" their medium and try to poach students to their tables. Show how to record and edit in those mediums.
They are supposed to already have submitted a defense of why they chose the medium they did.
They're probably interested in showing maps/images. Found footage? Stills?

Tool options:
- Canva
- Premiere
- iMovie
- Soundtrap
- Audacity

"These are the steps/things to look for in each of these tools."
Cutting, removing background noise, etc.
Add a music bed.

## JK notes:

BIG Q's:
* who is around and excited to help with these?
* are we still doing the worktime/hackathon that was requested for the 25th?

They are coming in having already done an assignment on "why" podcast or video for their project. So our focus can be on 
1. looking at this reading and discussing how you make an academic argument using the "machine" of a podcast or video.
2. a tour of the tools:
    * garageband
    * premiere
    * canva
    * fcpx
    * logic
