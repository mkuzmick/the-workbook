# SEAS Faculty Visualization Project

In collaboration with Eliza, a SEAS administrator, and her partner Nahn from the CS 171 course, Media & Design Fellows Tica Lin (CS) and Zane Wolf (OEB) are helping Eliza and Nahn make both encoding improvements, aesthetic improvements, and eventually backend/frontend improvements to their visualizations that describe interdepartmental collaborations at SEAS (Arc), shared research interests (Matrix), and connections between faculty, departments, and centers (Flow).
