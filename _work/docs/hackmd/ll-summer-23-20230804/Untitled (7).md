To complete this project and get your graphicsLab license, you will need to complete an arc that is your project arc, that involves several projects. You will put together a branding package for your favorite course or department -not one but a bunch of linked type things. a slide, a card, a logo, a poster. intersections with other labs-graphics for web with code lab and presenting the slide for studio lab.

your "company" could even be convincing your audience of an idea or argument that you found compelling in one of your courses. you fav course, your concentration or department.

### The goals are:
* to learn the major tools we will use in graphicsLab work
* to develop taste/style and understand how to deploy principles of graphic design to achieve what you are aiming for
* to learn the mathy things in Ps or css
    * don't eyeball anything, use math to make your design precise
* leaning on conventional materials from course (the typical syllabus, template for slides for that course-making arguments about the info strucutre of that discpline (graph next to ic, single words, bullet concpets. not just deocrative but functional-provide a rationale for WHY those slides. maybe 5 slides for the template))

## the big picture:

### Phase 1. IMITATE 
one particularly succesful method of learning a tool is the imitation exersize, or the rebuilding of a model. By finding something you like and showing you know how to make it intentionally, recreating every detail and move of the thing, you will have proven that you know how to use the tools to achieve a specific goal.

some basic moves to make sure you are solid on:
* get what modular grids are and how they work, and then how to use them (and break them) in different key tools

### Phase 2. REMIX
developing taste = key component is finding a lot of stuff and showing you know how to make something intentionally. In this new phase, you will not be recreating a single model, but rather mixing a bunch of elements to achieve something new, grounded in the design principles you've learned from your imitation exercise.
#### 1. collect and annotate a set of models.
* find models that you gravitate towards. 
* identify elements of the model that you want to use in your own
* explain why you are drawn to it and how you think using that element will support what you are hoping to communicate to your audience.
* you might think of this as analagous to an annotated bibliography for a research paper.
* do a close reading of a template
#### 2. build your package.
we are looking for your package to be a cohesive design, and it must include:
* poster design: a single page, a unit (not a magazine spread or brochure layout). 
* card design
* button design
* slide design
* css and graphics for the web
* printing as a mechanic and the careful design of something you would print and pay to print
* design the syllabus of the future
* the template you'd offer the client
