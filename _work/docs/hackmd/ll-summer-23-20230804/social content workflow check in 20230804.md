## case study
For the Kevin and Madeleine do Chat GPT prompts with blocks and marbles edits using the 20230628.0.1330_LLSUMMEROFAI.Content.Recording footage
-   6/30/23 - Madeleine spent 2 hours and 45 minutes working on ins & outs
-   7/5/23 - Sophie spent 7 hours working from home. Got through the whole sheets of ins and outs and visuals. (including watching tutorials to do the special effects requested) 
-   Left to do is the color and sound - 4 hours estimated for Sophie

Estimated time it takes for Sophie to edit: 11 hours
Estimated time it would take an MPA to edit: 28 hours

## messy notes
* use ll-content-lab moving forward
* continue to work on moonshot project as there is time
* llufs in content-labs can help
* but staff should produce examples so llufs can see examples, and also so staff can answer questions
