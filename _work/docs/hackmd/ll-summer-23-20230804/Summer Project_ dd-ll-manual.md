## Project Details

### Context

(bullets on the background or context that make the project needed or necessary)

The Learning Lab data and information is stored and shared in a variety of different systems (ie. slack, airtable, hackMD, 1password, etc.) We'd like to work on cleaning, re-organizing, and articulating our systems this summer. This can be used for staff to reference throughout the year. In addition, some of the text could be pulled into the fellows' manuals for next year.
