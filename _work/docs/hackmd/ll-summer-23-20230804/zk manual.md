### Hello! Welcome to the manual. 

Here we have everything you'll ever need to know about our cats, Dove, Pixie, and Scout. An image is shown below of all of them together.

We have information about the cats, their favorite toys, what they like, their age, what they look like, and much more.

### Dove (aka Lady Chonk, Soggynose)

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F058SCUKYGK/img_1935.jpg?pub_secret=2516cdbddc)

Appearance: Gray tabby. Green eyes. Chonky. Pink nose.

Gender: Female

Age: Almost 2 years old when I'm writing this, but she'll be 2 by the time you're taking care of her.

Favorite toy: Pompoms.

Dove is the mother of Pixie and Scout. She will often sit on them, and attack them, or kick them in the face when they try to nurse. She also tries to steal their food sometimes- so please try to stop her when she does. She doesn't like to play very much, but  occasionally she will stand up to try to get a toy. When she does, feel free to give her a treat (not too many, though). She loves eating wet hair- especially right after it's been washed. She likes sleeping on the highest basket of the cat tree, but we don't know if she can get up there on her own, so if she wants to get up, you can just lift her up there. She can be the most friendly & cuddly out of all of our cats sometimes, but if you annoy her, she might attack you. She is pretty chill when she's out on the porch, but just don't take her out without her harness. 


### Pixie (aka Destroyer of Insects, Little Miss Chonk)

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F059G88S5J4/img_1818.jpg?pub_secret=3fcce60c60)

Appearance: Brownish-gold tabby. One eye. Eye is amber-
colored. Pink nose.

Gender: Female

Age: 1 year old

Favorite toy: Springs

Pixie is the daughter of Dove, and the sister of Scout. She looks very similar to Scout if you don't look at her face, but there will also be instructions on how to tell them apart later in this manual. She can jump very high and likes to play, especially with springs. She likes the string springs too. She easily unravels them, but if you want to make it into a spring again, then you can just wrap it around your finger. Her claws can be very sharp sometimes, so watch out  for her claws. She does not like when you rub her belly. For some reason, she likes to chew on the stick of a ribbon toy we have. We don't know why. She also sleeps in very funny positions. She seems a bit scared when she goes on the porch, so I would recommend maybe not taking her out there.
Note: She sat on Dove once.

### Scout (aka Toe-nibbler)

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05956EMATT/img_1824.jpg?pub_secret=2a5bc50f52)

Appearance: Brown tabby. Greenish-yellow eyes. Darker nose than Dove and Pixie.

Gender: Female

Age: 1 year old

Favorite toys: EVERYTHING!!!(but her favorite is the ribbon toy)

Scout is the daughter of Dove, and the sister of Pixie. She looks very similar to Pixie if you don't look at her face, but there will also be instructions on how to tell them apart later in this manual. She is very friendly, but she doesn't really like to be held. She meows a lot, she will say good morning to you when you wake up, and she will meow at you to try to get you to play with her, and she REALLY loves to play. She is the most athletic out of all of our cats. She sometimes squeaks when she's sleeping and you wake her up. (It's very cute.) She tries to nurse a lot, but that usually just ends in Dove kicking her in the face. She also sometimes jumps on top of the bookshelf in my mom and dad's room. She is very adventurous, and when we took her onto the porch, she climbed through the railing, and got onto the back door steps porch thing. So, maybe don't take her out on the porch.


### The Dresser

An image is shown with what is in each drawer. As you can see, there is cat stuff in the top left drawer, like toys, brushes, their harness, etc. In the top right drawer is random stuff. In the second to top drawer is towels. In the middle drawer is socks and stuff. You probably won't need to go in there. The second to bottom drawer is hand towels, and the bottom drawer is just random stuff.


### Where Is The Cat Food?

We keep the dry food in a cupboard in the dining room, next to the doorway of the living room. A picture of the dry food bag (and some cats) is shown below.

We will either keep the wet food in the lazy susan, or on the shelf under the clock in between the dining room and kitchen. We will also have extra wet food downstairs.


### How to tell Scout and Pixie apart

Without looking at their faces, it can be difficult to tell Scout and Pixie apart. So, here I have tips on telling them apart.

Honorable Mention- Scout's nose is darker than Pixie's, but to see their nose, you have to look at their face, so this one isn't very useful for telling them apart without looking at their faces.

Number 1- Scout has a stripe all the way down her back, while Pixie does not. An image of this is shown below.

Number 2- Pixie is a bit more orange-ish than Scout. She is kind of orangeish-brown, while scout is just brown, as you can tell in the image above.
