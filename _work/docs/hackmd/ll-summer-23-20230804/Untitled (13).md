## absolute requirements

### returning/lab co-leader mdfs
* post at least 5 posts to your lab channel each week
* hold weekly lab office hours during the term
    * 1 - 2 hours per week, recurring on same date/time. we would LOVE for you to be around in this capacity as much as you'd be psyched about! 
        * at the start of the term, these office hours will be a time where you are physically present and working on lab related learning for yourself, and making yourself available to other staff, mdfs, and llufs who are working on projects related to your lab. Then as the term progresses, likely by mid-October, we may schedule some one on one consultations or offer this time to students in courses to come by for office hours and get help on the assignments they are working on
* be a point person (in person and on slack) throughout the term for lab projects and questions about the tools/media associated with your lab
* collate lab reports based on the posts/links that lab members are posting on slack
* offer toolTimes that teach the rest of us what you're learning in your lab
    * internal note - we should determine if there is an amount or frequency that we want to require
* participate in all fellows' lab show and tells on Fridays (all mdfs and LLUFs?)
    * maybe once a month?

### new mdfs
* dock with a lab
* undertake initial learning project in that lab, documenting your learning path 
* post at least once per week in your lab channel
* be ready to support LL office hours at the end of the fall term, determining a specific hour each week you'll be at the LL
* offer toolTimes as you learn different tools in the lab
    * internal note - we should determine if there is an amount or frequency that we want to require, and also if we want to say WHEN they should start doing this
* participate in all fellows' lab show and tells on Fridays (all mdfs and LLUFs?)
    * maybe once a month?

### kevin
* Dock with a lab and undertake the learning projects in that lab
* Post at least 5 posts to your lab channel each week 
* collate lab reports based on the posts/links that lab members are posting on slack
    * help co-leaders with this?
* host weekly lab office hours at the LL (kevin to do an AI one? or he's here for more general consulting?)
    * hold weekly lab office hours during the term
    * 1 - 2 hours per week, recurring on same date/time. we would LOVE for you to be around in this capacity as much as you'd be psyched about! 

### all labs
* do at least one designLab per term
* do monthly show and tells on Fridays (all lab show and tell)
* document individual learning and share regular updates on slack

## things to make to support labs
* lab report form
    * airtable form pinned in slack
    * maybe in individual mdf channel to emphasize their responsibility for it?
    * unless we want everyone to fill these in?
* lab project proposal form
    * airtable form pinned in slack
    * in the slack channel - same form for MDFs and LLUFs and then mdf co-leader and LL staff member review
* way to quickly get a view of what they're making
    * slack to
        * airtable > next.js site
        * timeline
        * something printable for physical space

## learning arc
* fall: learning projects, very concrete
    * then maybe they spin off into smaller pairs or even individually to build asynch and share on slack
    * monthly all LL show + tell (mdfs + LLUFS)?
    * one toolTime per project? one thing you learned = one thing you teach the rest of us
    * link these projects to things we need for courses (way for MDFs to propose lab projects in airtable form?)
    * toolTimes for other grads
* spring: moonshot project that's super ambitious
    * cross-lab collabs?
    * design a component of the final showcase, an exhibition that requires all the lab media forms

## mdfs make in labs
* resources for students, future MDFs and LLUFs
* prototypes for their departments and for projects like HH
* really cool media for reporting + storytelling

## questions for airtable forms
### lab report
* what did you learn?
* what did you make?
* what were the challenges?
* media

### project proposal
* describe the project
    * what is it
    * why is it needed
    * any courses/projects it connects to (for mdfs)
* milestones
* number of hours it'll take
* any collaborators who will work with you?
