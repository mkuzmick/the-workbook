# summer galleryLab and webLab planning proposal

## project description

Anna and Christine will prototype virtual galleries in a coding and AI-driven galleryLab. By developing these galleries, Anna and Christine will develop workflows that will allow us to display and share:
* student work from the courses that we support at the LL
* MDF projects 
* LL projects that we'd like to be able to share with the broader community

This project will require developing our coding skills, and we'll explore possible applications of AI/ML in our projects (including using AI to assist learners with little/no formal training in coding). We will build AR/VR galleries in Unity, gallery views that could be printed and hung up in physical space, and web-based galleries that could be shared with different audiences at the University. In so doing, we'll develop workflows related to databasing and backend development.

An additional aspect of this project is preparing for webLab, which will be one of the core labs at the LL during AY2023/2024. Anna will help Christine map out a plan for that lab, including the initial learning steps everyone in the lab will need to take in order to get their lab "passport."

## timeline/milestones
* build airtable base of student projects, MDF headshots, etc.
* learn how to pull data from airtable
* design a Next website
* design a Unity gallery
    * a view of the LL that has the layout and some text about the most conceptually exciting workshop that made full use of the studio
