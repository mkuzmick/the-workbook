# welcomeLab+ brainstorming 20230801

## messy notes
how do llufs get involved with welcomeLab or contentLab?

portfolio submissions definitely make sense for contentLab

application for llufs to get involved in things beyond the core Labs
* special internal project (content lab or welcome lab team)
* moonshot project


the core labs are the containers for learning. so if people want to just clean or JUST do welcome lab, that's totally fine with mk. but llufs who want to learn, they learn within a lab.

welcome or content Lab - llufs have to be selected.
