## At a Glance

This project will help me develop new ways of tracking and dynamically capturing/displaying MDF projects. And get me ready to support codeLab! And learn how github works, which I remain pretty confused by (not conceptually but practically)!

###### tags: tools, next.js, github, mdf, labs

## Project Details

### Context

* To support MDF work, I need better ways of helping them share with us and with their MDF cohort updates, milestones, etc.
    * I would love to get proficient enough to be able to make custom views for Friday MDF meetings!
* This project supports the public-facing storytelling we do about the MDF program (i.e., to update departments or make new departmental contacts).
* It will help me be more thoughtful about documentation, as I consider the types of assets I would ideally have on a site.

### Deliverables 
* A website that displays project titles (as links that then open into individual pages), a hero image or other form of media (e.g., video, gif), and project descriptions.
* Code that allows us to print these


### Outcomes and Next Steps

* roadmap for codeLab initial learning project
* sense of the types of info + documentation we need from MDFs

### Timeline
* next.js-week 1:
    * NEXT UP: hover over bubble to make project text appear
        * then add an image
    * linked to summer 23 airtable base using airtable API
    * passed in objects from the array to display project title, project description 
    * worked with React components for styling
    * learned about and applied Flexbox styling
* end of May
    * find a general aesthetic I like
    * figure out how to only pass in MDF projects (rather than all LL projects)
    * get homepage up

* June
    * prototype gallery view (hero shots as a grid of clickable links that take you into project descriptions??)
