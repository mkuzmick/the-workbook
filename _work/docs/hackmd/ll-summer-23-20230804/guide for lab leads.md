# guide for lab leads

## learning projects
things we probably want most learning projects to include:
* a linkedin learning or some sort of set of after effects tutorials
* a model to recreate (we could find an industry standard one we like)
*  steps outlining how to recreate it
*  a checklist for minimum requirements
*  side quest for deeper dives
* a "pinteresting" step
* samples of work (emmy & jk will make)
* language that promotes growth mindset in prompt
* a way of getting feedback from llufs (the work submission form in most cases)
