the basic idea:
* this component essentially bookends the ILP. It is where you will begin the first step of the process, and it is where you will complete the final step of the process.
* create documentation of your choices as a designer
* provide rationale for those choices
* give your client (the course head aka your amazing prof) a visual system they can parse and use

## learning resources
there is a linkedin Learning course on branding. some of it isn't super relevant to this particular project, but here are a few bits that might be useful:

* [identity systems](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/brand-design-foundations/identity-systems?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2194065) - 4 min video

you want to determine what the mission/goals/etc are of your course and use those elements to determine your branding choices. 

## materials to use
some things you can use to help as you make decisions about branding for your course:
* the course description when you do a course search
* the syllabus
* you can look to see what other courses in that discipline/concentration/department are to see if you can find out what makes your course unique

## steps:
1. choose your course.
2. define the brand attributes. 
    * List 10 words that to you best describe the nature of this course
    * How is this course unique, what makes it stand out in comparison to other courses in the same concentration, etc.
3. research industry/companies related to the course content to get an ideas of the branding terrain.
    * 3+ models, add to your InDesign workbook.
    * This is a great resource to find models:

    * in Adobe Illustrator, set up a landscape 11 x 17 page
    * type in the name in any typeface, and duplicate 5 across and 8 down so you have 40 names total
    * try out all different fonts across (5 total), and try different variations in each column (ex.all caps, left-aligned, etc.). Try a bunch of things as you explore-this is the time to explode all the ideas!
    * go back to your attributes and choose 1 or 2 from each row/column, and copy those each to a new artboard. so now you have it narrowed down to about 4-6
    * now experiment with different arrangements. try stacked, horizontal, changing the kerning...
