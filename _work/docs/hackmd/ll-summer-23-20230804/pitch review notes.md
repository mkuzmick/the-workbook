## 20230711
* christine pitch - between 5 and 30 seconds, doesn't have a narrative necessarily, more like a video snapshot. backwards looking - some weird cool thing happened. we want to come up with a name for this category of thing. MK thinks we could do 3-5 of these a week. could give to someone who doesn't need to be insanely knowledgeable about the content. 
* figure out how designLab scheduling/events airtable
* re: anna ai girl aesthetic, what are the categories of at the table discussion?
    * designLab - designLabs need proposals and planning, we're using a lot more resources
    * reflections - take fewer people, can be a little less planned. they're reflecting on something that happened.
    * dialogue - conversation sparkers or conversation prompts. a piece of media just happened emerged and there's a conversation around that, very podcast-y
    * report on a course you're working on - sabrina christine and kevin
to do in a separate doc
* mw list out content types
* mk can help with descriptions & story structures. 
    * mk will help think about LL work that matches with that and work with dani on scheduling and then with sophie and casey on workflows etc. 
* mw will think about whether eachs need to have insert shots and playful gifs, or is this something that can be put together from footage.
* ll learn something fail etc
* or an expert show and tell
* if its an expert talking, we can greenlit the ai vector pitch. otherwise we need a learning object designed before we can try it out.
* ai animation - this would be a full project to launch. mk excited to greenlight but would need a lot of time to discuss and plan.
* AI throughout time - prototype of video essay. also connected to our job of maintaining an ai timeline of creative tools etc. could be a highly polished video essay or madeleine and kevin could just work on the ai timeline as a timeline and then just periodically record filmed reflections. identify who can do quality control of it - so think on that. sabrina? someone else? 
* vote out the ai - connect to anna's Airtable API work- project launch
* lesson plans series - we would need a gifted teacher about the topics. so gifted teacher on neural network would have the ethos to be the judge of the ai lesson plans
    * but kevin is capable as a learner of neural network
* ai lesson plans is really AI versus expert and maybe can be something mdfs do at orientation. (AI versus learner for llufs)

to do for mk & dd-
* re event tracking, space to decide what resources we want to give, what kinds of stories we want from events etc.
* project launches:
    * Vote out the ai
    * AI animation


details on greenlit pitches:
* christine pitch - between 5 and 30 seconds
* anna ai girl aesthetic - focus on AI tools and some way of connecting this to classroom activities. MK would like a doc to give feedback on, way to craft in advance a way for anna to be successful. what length?
