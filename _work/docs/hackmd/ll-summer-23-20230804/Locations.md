## [the stuff base](https://airtable.com/appgoOSPVFvlxDNG8/tbluefz0GAIsafrA1/viwdONugjnUqMvbDf?blocks=hide)

## goals
* know what we have and where it goes
* make it easier for mpas and fellows to find things and to help us put things away in the right spot
* get things that should be always or frequently in use out in more open storage
* keep storage room doors shut, and have things that are stored in there be the warehouse annex type of things 
    * extras in excess of what we typically have in use
    * things we rarely use
* get storage room 3 into a working space for paper documentation and button making


## ideas for the plan
we can have an airtable base that folks can reference when looking for something, or for finding out where something that's out should go

## steps for implementing the plan

1. log an inventory of everything we have
2. decide ideal places for things to be (see goals above)


## storage based on stores:
