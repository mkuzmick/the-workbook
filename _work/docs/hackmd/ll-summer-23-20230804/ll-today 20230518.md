## mini work-in-progress show and tell notes
* watch a video on css selectors
* get server side props (it will run that function whenever someone asks for it by going to the page) vs. get static props (when the website gets built, gets data from airtable and saves on server and then gives you data stored from the server that is not updated) vs. get (used for the api routes to build our own API instead of using airtable's API)
