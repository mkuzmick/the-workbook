# Summer Project: Coding Party

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05BNK4R6NS/elle.l.studio_animals_learning_to_code_at_a_party_3881fad0-2b6c-4e97-89ad-7a62bac823f8.png?pub_secret=6deedc4f44)

## At a Glance
Anna and Christine will prototype virtual galleries in a coding and AI-driven galleryLab. By developing these galleries, Anna and Christine will develop workflows that will allow us to display and share:
* student work from the courses that we support at the LL
* MDF projects 
* LL projects that we'd like to be able to share with the broader community

###### tags: code, codeLab, aiLab, labs, mdf

## Project Details

### Context

This project will require developing our coding skills, and we'll explore possible applications of AI/ML in our projects (including using AI to assist learners with little/no formal training in coding). We will build AR/VR galleries in Unity, gallery views that could be printed and hung up in physical space, and web-based galleries that could be shared with different audiences at the University. In so doing, we'll develop workflows related to databasing and backend development.

An additional aspect of this project is preparing for webLab, which will be one of the core labs at the LL during AY2023/2024. Anna will help Christine map out a plan for that lab, including the initial learning steps everyone in the lab will need to take in order to get their lab "passport."

### Deliverables 
* lab roadmap for codeLab/webLab
* references/resources/tutorials for codeLab
* gallery template
* code that others could use
* printable glossary of key terms or a template for next year's MDFs and LLUFs to fill in as they learn

### Outcomes and Next Steps
* how do we get user input
    * codeLab 2023/2024 book
    * have learning module for the fall
    * start laying things out
    * useState!
* get really good at styling 2D stuff!
* really reactive and interactive
    * personality quiz another learning project
* OBS web overlay that links to our Next site personality quiz

### Timeline
* build airtable base
* learn how to pull data from airtable
* design a Next website
* design a Unity gallery
    * a view of the LL that has the layout and some text about the most conceptually exciting workshop that made full use of the studio

##### Tutorials
* For creating your first app, [this one](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) from Next.js seems pretty good and kind of similar to what we did in orientation! 
* [This React tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/app) is good for someone who wants to follow along and try everything out, but it does need some existing knowledge of JavaScript etc (which it also links to!)
* [Code Academy Javascript free course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/welcome-to-an-introduction-to-react-coaaf455789c2a9addc20dd24) course: I'm not sure at what point it isn't free, but this one looks good for people who learn well from a combination of video & tutorial 
* [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) could be a model for how someone structures a tutorial; people seem to like this one!
