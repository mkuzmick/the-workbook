## At a Glance
 
Summer Launch (or “slaunch”) is a prototype of a documentation workflow for projects of the order of 10-50 hours (previously referred to as microprojects). The goal is for the LL staff to test this workflow this summer to help structure their work, give us documentation we can use for reporting, and to think about what we’d like fellows to do for the next academic year.

## Project Details

### Context

(bullets on the background or context that make the project needed or necessary)

### Deliverables 
* template for the summer project launch hackMD, to be a dashboard/home base for each summer project (done)
* slash command "/slaunch" that creates a record in the summerwork base and generates a hackMD link (done)
* having slack show the airtable record and hackMD link after using the slash command (to do)
* having the hackMD auto-populate with the template markdown (to do)

### Outcomes and Next Steps
* we'll gather staff feedback over the summer about how this is working for them, to see what we want to revise
* we'll also work with staff to help them bring it into alignment with what they want to do with their fellows

### Timeline
* DD&MK started this in week 0 of summer
* DD&MK are doing a big push during week 1 of summer to use this ourselves and to help staff start to use this
* we'll see how this goes, and review next week when folks may want to slaunch a new project for week 2
* DD&MK to decide on different milestones/dates to do a more thorough review of the process or gathering more feedback on the process

### References, Models, and Resources 
* /launch was an inspiration for /slaunch
