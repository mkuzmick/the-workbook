## plan

### 20230626: session 3: recording + editing hackathon

* prepare your story of the summer presentation
    * tension to resolution
        * is there some kind of a mystery or a question that your group wanted to solve (describe this)
        * how did learning something in a course help you come to an understanding that solved that mystery
        * ex.: "So many members of my community were impacted by covid, and I really wanted to understand why it had impacted so many people I knew. This summer, I learned about how covid spreads at the cellular level."
        * on TWO CARDS: one with the mystery/question; one with the !/answer
* record in the small studio
* work on editing
* WE WILL SEND PROXY FOOTAGE TOMORROW

### 20230620 workshop 2: scicomm, storytelling/practice presenting, editing

* tension to resolution (10 mins)
    * could use the vox beaver video for this
    * or the one about chairs
* visualizing to discover (40 mins - 20 for making, 20 for presenting)
    * arts supplies
    * illustrate a process
    * prepare a tension to resolution story
        * there's this mystery/this question/this tension and I'm going to explain it/resolve it for you!
    * do this at the main table
    * have it projected on main screen
    * emphasize this is PRACTICE for formal run through in small studio next week

    * a key scientific term, process, or concept
    * can you explain it in one minute with no script?

    * have them share in the SMALL STUDIO
* station 2: b-roll (CC or MPAs)
    * what is it

    * how can it be used
    * SHOW CANVA HERE
* station 3: 3 shot story (MPAs or CC)
* station 4: storyboarding shots you'd want to get (SC)
    * visuals you'd want to show to document what you're learning

* share out at the end (save 15 mins for this)
    * SMALL STUDIO
    * share your visuals
    * tell us what you've learned so far

* atems to let them switch between b-roll and speaking to camera?
* dynamic mics to practice interviewing (connected to cameras with headphones and splitters)

### workshop 2:
* art supplies
* overhead + green screen
* computers for editing practice using footage from session 1

### workshop 3:
* computers for editing
* small studio?

## notes

1. an intro session where we launch the project and help them think about storytelling, communicating science and the types of b-roll they should capture with their phones (or camera kits, if they'll have those again), and then give them some basic templates for the final video that will help guide their work over the course of the summer
2. a rehearsal session where they refine their stories-of-the-summer and the visuals they'll use to illustrate their concepts (this session would involve on-camera practice for the final session)
3. a final session during which they will record a live presentation in our small studio, which will form the backbone of the final video project.

Questions they've been asked to reflect on:

What is something I have learned during the program that excites me?
How can I be an agent of positive change for my community?

The first question should capture something content related (i.e., scientific), but through the lens of what they found inspiring or exciting about the topic.  The second question should direct them to translate their excitement about what they're learning into something that can help their communities.
