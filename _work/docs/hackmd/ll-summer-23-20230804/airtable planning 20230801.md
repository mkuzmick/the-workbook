## to do
* start with... 
    * dani copies and preps projects-23-24
    * dani prototypes ll-index (or all-time-gallery) with projects 22-23 and 23-24 (maybe even 21-22 etc?)
    * mk and dani prioritize
        * ll-event-base-23-24
            * events
            * sync from gcal table (at least ll-plan)
            * users/attendees
            * resources/rooms
        * ll-do-your-work-base-23-24
        * ll-show-your-work-base-23-24
        * next
            * ll-studio-bot-base-23-24 (mk does this)
            * ll-moment-base-23.08 (mk does this)
            * other experimental


## project launch lifecycle
* we get an email from a faculty member.
* they request a consultation.
* dani adds an appointment to the calendar.
* dani creates a metaproject and project in ll-projects-23-24
* dani needs to link the faculty member, so either they are already in _PEOPLE, or dani goes to bok whitepages. if they are there but not tagged as "LL", add LL. if they are not there, add their people record to the whitepages
* before the meeting/as emails come in, MW adds to correspondance log.
* dani creates a notes by day doc for the meeting with linked correspondance log
* during the meeting, dani takes notes in that doc. if they want to schedule something, dani schedules in google calendar. if it's a workshop, dani adds a new project in ll-projects-23-24 and then goes to the task base to add the related projects (ie. workshop and assign it to someone, resource development, student video recordings, etc.)
* once a workshop is scheduled, we want a workshop plan doc to be made.
* we also want the notes by day moved over to the correspondance log
* dani scans calendar ahead 2 weeks to make sure we are sending check in emails before workshops

*where can we automate? where can we make smoother? where can dani get mw's help with some of these things?*
