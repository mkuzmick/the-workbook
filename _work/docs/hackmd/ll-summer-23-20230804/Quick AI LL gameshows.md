# Quick AI LL gameshows

## Vote Out the AI (Chat GPT)

LL staff answer a series of questions about a particular topic - except one of them is using Chat GPT to answer. Every 3 questions the LL staff take a blind vote 

#### Key Moves:
* supersource
* confessionals
* "voice of God" PA system 
* live stills 


## AI Pictionary (Midjourney)

Creator tries to recreate a famous movie still on midjourney using descriptive words only (no proper nouns) and the LL staff tries to guess what it is.

#### Key Moves:

* supersource
    * actual movie still, creator's attempted movie still, wide shot of LL staff guessing, screen capture of creator's input 


## AI Telephone (Midjourney)

Like a classic game of telephone but replacing whispering words with written descriptions into midjourney. 

#### Key Moves:

* Live button-making
    * Making buttons for each iteration of the AI-generated image 
    * confessionals
    * studio configurations (can put them in a line next to each other or in seperate rooms)

## some mechanics (with whats, hows and whys)

For any given mechanic in the LL, there will be at least one core intellectual move (and probably more than one). It could help to name this move and describe it as best we can, and perhaps to give an example of how it might look in a couple of different disciplinary contexts.

It's also probably the case that it's difficult think of absolutely discrete, "atomic" mechanics that can't be broken down further; likewise there is probably much to be gained by defining a few standard configurations of multiple related mechanics, so let's not slow ourselves down **too** much by trying to get all atomic about it.


### guessing
#### what and why
Guessing is fun. So it has that going for it. The one challenge is that it is alignment with a mental model of knowledge that is actually something we try to get AWAY from in teaching and learning centers (the basic idea that to know is to be the possessor of a bunch of facts--the sorts of facts you might memorize before an exam so that you can "ace the test" by regurgitating true facts).

That said, if we think of guessing as involving the sorts of intellectual activities we might in other contexts deploy to generate knowledge (conceived of as a "knowing how" and "knowing why" rather than "knowing that"), then we can probably use it to create activities that are in alignment with a given course's learning objectives. The guessing might be evidence-based, perhaps involving the interpretation and analysis of the sorts of evidence and datasets that students are interpreting in the course. 

Of course, if we are designing a quick activity that actually has an objective that is tangential to the guessing operation, quiz-show-style guessing can for sure be a great way to hold an activity together, giving it a clear destination and structure. (And your goal may be as simple as "creating classroom community" through some sort of icebreaker activity--but if so, you'd probably be designing a 10-minute guessing game rather than a 60-minute one)

#### technologies for guessing games (how)

- quiz/question/data/clue displays
    - computer graphic-to-screen (holding words, computer-generated images, datasets, artworks)
    - paper or object under overhead on large screens
    - physical objects/clues at table
- answer holders
    - cards (classic tools for distributing information asymmetrically)
    - overturned buttons
    - ll-folded-boxes to hold cards, buttons or other
    - closed books
    - ll-studio-isolation with ATEM switching to hide and reveal
    - ll-studio-isolation with veiled TVs to hide and reveal
    - yellow pelican cases to give each of 4 tables a surprise box
- guessing mechanics
    - discuss in pairs or small groups, decide on one guess and share
    - single guess on card
    - multiple guesses on cards
    - placing a token in a location
    - matching (placing word card next to image card, say)
    - guess at micro-presentation on stage (perhaps with the reveal happening behind or around you through realtime production techniques)

#### some examples

- film-class ai-pictionary
    - have students prompt an ai-image generator to recreate a number of classic shots from films the class is viewing
    - have students rotate to a table with images other students created; here they must guess which films/shots they are encountering
    - the key to this activity will be the debrief, where students will reflect on both
        1. what they learned about the match/mismatch between their understanding of film terminology and the AI's prompt-parsing abilities
        2. what they can say about the singular elements of the original shot by comparing and constrasting it with the AI imitation
        3. in certain contexts, they may even reflect on what they can say about both the grammar of cinema and the recurrent patterns they detect on the AI's training dataset; and they may be drawn into a discussion of similarities and differences between these two as ways of contrasting past and present, high-art and popular culture, etc etc.




### confessional booth recording

Courses often involve 


### supersource
- of 4x student work
- of 4x curated/selected data
