### overview of the summer

Over the course of each summer we try to improve on the LL studio and system, and this summer is no different! Key priorities include:

1. augmenting the AV system's ability to support and document live events
2. augmenting the LL's various storytelling workflows (everything from informal posts to #ll-show-your-work to more formal reports we write for deans and donors to the growing need for a social media presence)
3. using AI tools to enhance our work (and reporting on our experiments so that others in the education, media, arts and technology space can connect with us and learn from us)
4. developing resources for the key "labs" we'll devote our attention to in 23-24

Right now we have a number of overlapping projects targeting these goals.

- Jordan and Christine are working on fellow-facing lab resources
- everyone is learning more about the operation of the AV system
- Casey and Jordan are working on redesigning some of the storage systems for the space
- Madeleine is working on turning the documentation of LL activities into stories appropriate for various social media platforms (focusing initially on AI tools this summer), and this is providing a great test case for Sophie and Casey and Dani to think about the media production workflow as a whole
- etc.

### what can jessi do?

I'm sure Jessi can help out with all of the above, but initially it seems smart to focus on augmenting the "live show," its capture/documentation, and the development of stories out of this documentation.

Some more specific concrete goals
- augmenting the live show and its documentation
    - get everyone comfortable with the basic technical components of this
        - where are ME 1-4 recording?
        - where are they visible?
        - how can I switch them?
        - what are some ways to log segments and moments so that I can edit from them later?
        - what are some ways to capture good audio when appropriate?
        - what can I do with macros? and how can I save my own?
        - etc
    - start identifying to key moves or elements of **the LL Live Event grammar**
        - supersources: what are they? what are some ways to use them?
        - chroma key with green paper on table
        - chroma key with full body green screen
        - luma key in small studio
        - varieties of break out tables
        - live stills
        - making buttons
        - presenting from main table
        - presenting with the PA system and stage
        - presenting from small studio
        - canva shared presentations as collective visual workspace
        - web-based polling
        - OBS for overlays
        - web apps for switching
        - macros 
        - etc etc
    - then start experimenting with complex forks or remixes of these (and entirely new things)
        - realtime 3d work with Unreal and Unity
        - more complex macro-driven workflows
        - integration of web-apps and physical space, etc
    - through it all, try to create resources for others to learn all this
    - through it all, experiment with AI tools (like Ps Generative Fill for button production, etc)
- storytelling
    - do some AI-centric days and work with Madeleine on turning the content into social posts
