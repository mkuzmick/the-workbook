A running list of links for marlon to see and feedback i'm seeking!

* [graphics-lab-initial-learning-project](/gRfNqwfXQY-IttWzC1VSeQ)
    * I'm really excited to be doing this! just want to make sure i'm on the right track!

* [lluf program one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FaWYkAqMw8cn018Rkmcyn-ut-ivw_8_Gq03JtdOFQi4/edit#heading=h.g3r9yudqavf9)
    * this is the plan. the main goals of it are:
        * simplify admin = minimal to no scheduling
        * lluf agency to choose when and with whom they work
        * system & policy = invested llufs get more hours and freedom, others get limited hours to designlab type times
        * lluf specialization
        
* [LL Basics](/qfkTn-RzT2edGSIB91H01w)

     * I'm guessing it's cool to go ahead and start populating the various things with resources from the past or things we make along the way (like emmy writing up how she got connected to her linkedin learning account), just making sure! 
     * are some of these challenges more in the lab zone? I'm excited/curious about which ones seem most fitting for "the basics" that EVERYONE should know, and which ones you think can be more specialized. (i think i tend more towards everyone should know everything...but maybe it's too much to ask of folks)
* [Storage Plan](/YjArB8HrSY6KdPwEiZ3TCA)
    * check out the art materials section proposing organiztion based on blick!

* [animated data-vis](/S1V2erNVSHWxQdRfcjIeCw) 
    * this is a graphics-lab learning project emmy wants to develop! it uses after effects, and there will be a part of it that intersects with code lab. just hoping you can check it out and help us decide what we should focus on, especially content-wise.
