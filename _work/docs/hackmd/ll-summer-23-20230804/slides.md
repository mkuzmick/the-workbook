# slides

the basic idea:
* design a slide template for use in presenting to the course 
* create and share .kth files (keynote templates, aka "themes")
* utilize the visual system you have determined

We will use Keynote as our main slide development tool. Once you complete your graphics-lab ILP, you can, of course, return to this component as an additional LP and do a remix using google slides, canva, or powerpoint.
