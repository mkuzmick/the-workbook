## messy notes
* we want to make sure anna, jessi, and emmy's hours are useful in this space
* learning projects-ish
    * christine and anna working on code/web stuff
    * jk: graphics and studio and game and maybe reality deep dives for fall or at least the first part of fall? I think I really need to have a deep understanding of studio most of all. and love graphics. and would be equally excited about game and reality.
* continuity - returner mdf is with their lab the whole year. 
* christine and jordan have their eyes on everything. 
* the staff point person majorly involved in the learning project, being a person folks can ask questions to, and in charge of innovating in that space. 
* think about structure for returner mdfs leading labs
* week 0 - mdfs can start thinking about next cool steps in their labs
* meetings with lab leaders once a week? to get text for reporting, etc.
- maybe a winter showcase? something celebratory to work towards in the reporting zone too?
- a weekly round up slack post in the lab channel done by the lab lead. say something meaningful about what happened that week. higher order reflective thinking and writing about it.
- lluf responsibility-write up step by step guides, post cool things they found on the web related to their lab.
    - "this week in __lab"
    - and we'll have images at their disposal for this (ideally airtable view of show-your-work posts? tagged with the labs)
    - could be combo of links roundup and reflection
- connecting workshops and projects to labs - think more about how to do this in a systematized way
### people
* core labs and their point people?
    * avLab - casey & elitza? 
    * codeLab - christine & anna
    * graphicsLab - jordan & emily
    * realityLab - sophie & chris b
    * studioLab - marlon & siriana
* project labs
    * aiLab - 
    * gameLab - 

## initial learning project ideas
we should lean into LinkedIn learning for these if there are things we want to use.
* realityLab - modeling component, but then also connecting it as an interesting environment to use with the team. structuring it around virtual production
    * rigging that sophie did
    * annotating a map
* codeLab - next app that uses airtable as a backend and interfaces with the open AI API. maybe personality quiz idea. something we'd imagine using in our everyday workflow
* graphicsLab -  have sometimes done a rebuilding of a model. developing taste: key component is finding a lot of stuff and showing you know how to make something intentionally-imitation excersize. next step is mixing a bunch of elements to achieve something new, grounded in the design principles you've learned from your imitation exercise. 
    * poster design, a single page, a unit. 
    * card design
    * slide design
    * printing as a mechanic and the careful design of something you would print and pay to print.
    * css and graphics for the web
    * an arc that is your prject arc, that involves several projects. put together a branding package for an imaginary company-not one but a bunch of linked type things. a slide, a card, a logo, a scientific poster.intersections with other labs-graphics for web with code lab and presenting the slide for studio lab
* avLab - piece of media that we decide
* studioLab - mk will work on this.
    * workflow of printing
    * identifying mechanics we've always done and can do makes sense
### to do next
* check in with sophie and casey about those two labs
* think about the role MPAs can play in the labs
* we'll hold off for now on project labs
* jk+cd start thinking about architecture of the lab logistics + manuals
    * manuals
        * involve different media and tools (some language that helps fellows understand what we're doing/why)
        * skeleton of learning projects, links, etc.
        * projects that students/people have done in the past in this zone-how this stuff shows up in our work-models + expectations
        * requirements for the llufs and mdfs in the labs
    * slack channel directions
    * posting requirements
        * number per week and who does them
        * mdf lab reports
    * arc of the year
        * staff starts with being in charge of initial learning projects
        * as year goes on more people get to pitch ideas
        * moonshot labs in the spring as possibility
* work on rationales for the core labs (could be part of the manuals)
    * why is there one on this and not that
    * look at old lists of labs
