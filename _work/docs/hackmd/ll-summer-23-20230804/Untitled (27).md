## getting started
We will start our work by unpacking a couple of models of academic research posters. 

In this workshop, we're focusing on a broader audience for presenting our research. Writing a research paper is typically linear: abstract, background, methodology, etc but...how do we transform that narrative to a graphic and visual form?
* what are some ways oral and visual presentation "messes" with the traditional structure of academic writing and what are some ways it augments it?

1. take a look at some models of research posters [here](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/photo-galleries/uc-davis-academic-posters) and [here](https://www.matse.psu.edu/2021-undergraduate-research-poster-competition)
    a. note down some patterns you are noticing.
    b. what draws your eye? what path do your eyes take as you look more closely at the poster?

## key takeaways from examples

* organized into discrete sections: intro, methods, results, etc. that spatially organize information as almost a remix of the typical linear fashion of an academic paper
* you have choices of which sections you want to draw more attention to, which ones you want to be more visual vs. text-based
* eyes are drawn to certain elements:
    * top, middle, or top left
    * high-contrast (ie. different colors or font for titles)
    * ex. posters with hypothesis or results in the middle are more appealing or effective
* size parameters are important to consider (in this case 36x48)
    * think about how large your poster will be and how far your viewer will be

## visual vs. oral Presentation
* think about your poster as a guided tour where there is attention drawn to certain key features (ex. your results)
    * posters are meant to be experienced at levels of depth:
        * just a glance, major focus areas or a full read/look- through
* for oral presentations, think about doing this same type of tour, but in a temporal fashion (almost like a movie instead of a piece of art)
