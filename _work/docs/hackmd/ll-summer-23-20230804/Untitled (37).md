## schedule-y things
* final NAHSP session monday
* sabrina recording tuesday, wednesday, and thursday
* casey out friday
* jessi returns next week!!



## logistics around mk's OOO
* mk out starting wednesday and then for the rest of the month of july
* we'll plan to check in 9:30-10am every day (in person or zoom if mk/others at home want to join)
    * this can give us a change to test out interesting ways of integrating zoom people into recordings
* mk will work one other half day (tbd, this is flexible according to the needs of the week)
* dd canceled mk's staff 1-1s for month of july
* staff should let marlon and dani know if they are going to be unexpectedly out, and then also slack in ll-admin so tb+lm+cw can see
    * also kinda nice to put in ll-admin if you are planning on WFH the next day so other staff know
