## week of August 21:
* tues: 
    * onboarding + multimodal basics
    * could record these sessions for folks who miss
    * draw your diss on a card icebreaker
    * initial thinking about what works in the discipline, what doesnt (activity with a reading from their field)
    * maybe DAS - need to follow up
* thurs: 
    * live experiences/using the LL studio? or save for week 2?
        * stations in the studio
        * they have to combine 3-4 mechanics 
        * they go around to get a sense of the possibilities, then choose a few (like selecting dishes from a menu)
        * then they pitch their workshop idea, thinking about rationales for the mechanics
        * bonus points for coming up with their own mechanics!
        * doing something with games? design a game that makes use of LL studio?
    * could do alternative assignment design here if not in week 2
    * Belle Lipton, 1 - 3 pm
        * need to download qGIS on machines
        * 1st hour - conceptual re: data, maps, storage

## week of August 28:
* tues: assignment design
    * unpacking of a form(s)
    * defining learning goals
    * designing assignment
    * process of making/scaffolding
* thursday: responding/celebrating
    * jk idea: a discussion around challenges to give feedback on the form/content and how we often suggest "the artist statement" as a way of getting students into the metacog zone in providing rationale for their form choices given their content
    * maybe we could break into lab stations and lab leads could present the ILP and there could be an activity around how to give feedback on those?
