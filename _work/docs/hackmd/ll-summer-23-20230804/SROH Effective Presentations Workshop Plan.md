## learning objectives: 
* how to give an effective presentation on research
* perpare for poster presentations

## links and ideas:

the story they are telling is actually trying to structure a specific kind of scientific story and translate it into a visual and oral form (find models of scientific posters)

there norms of those forms (the oral and visual)
* there are ways in which graphic designs mess with that scientific structure or augment it 
* listening involves tension to resolution stucuture familiar with 
    * exercise with vocal tone - locate tenison in one register and resolve in another vocal register (fractal tension to resolution strucutre across the oral presentation)
    
jessi- critique a model we look at, then produce their own mdoel type of thing. then give us a tour of that (the oral in front of a poster-a walking tour of this space you've constructed on the poster
    
the ll can take these spaces and render them visible and have an emobided experience of it-chromo key, macros) 
* jessi misison: make a macro that get the person to be the right size and place of screen

it could be cool to do name buttons or some sort of group sorting using the facebook clarisse made

scientifc poster models
* what are they teaching us to see, why are there x columns do they map onto the steps of a sci paper? dealing with a 4-6 chnk story (papers strucutred that way) can't fit those into the 3 columens that feel natural-this puzzle will pop up and make something of that.
