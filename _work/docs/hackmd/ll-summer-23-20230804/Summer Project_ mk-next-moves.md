# Summer Project: mk-next-moves

![next.js 13 logo](https://blog.appsignal.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2022-11%2Fnextjs-13.png&w=3840&q=50)

## At a Glance

As we prepare for the Fall we need to develop support infrastructure around the fellows who wish to build web apps (the members of the codeLab). The goal of this project is to create a repository that plays a key role in codeLab training, not so much a template or starter *per se*, but an inventory or grammar of moves builders can make using the typical react/nextjs stack that we'll be using in 23-24.

## Project Details

### Context

Over the past 5 years, we've zeroed in on a toolchain for full-stack apps including Airtable, React and now NextJS (replacing Gatsby)--among others. But it has been extremely difficult to get people up to speed on all of these tools. This year, various AI coding assistants promise to make learning these tools (a little) easier. So it is an optimal time to invest in building out learning and building resources as we prepare to launch the 23-24 codeLab (which, it should be said, will include many returning fellows).

There are innumerable tutorials on the web, and assembling these into a list of annotated links is smarter than creating our own tutorials from scratch.

But there is also a need for the LL approach to the problem => thinking through the basic "grammar of moves" or available in a medium or encyclopedia of the maneuvers with a given tool, etc. And, cruciually, identify and identifying the functions these moves and maneuvers might fulfill in our context. 

### Deliverables 

A documented NextJS app that begins with at least 10 basic moves that members of codeLab might want to deploy as builders of their own NextJS apps. The repository should be public in the main account that codeLab members will have access to, and the app should be hosted on Vercel (unless their are elements that are intended to be local-only). 

### Outcomes and Next Steps

The scale of the moves discussed will be such that we would ultimately want 1001 instead of 10 or even 100. But the idea is that members of the 23-24 codeLab would contribute their own over time. So the project has a chance to grow over time, and to play a structural and structuring role in the LL's 23-24 work.

For the staff involved in building the app over the summer, the goal will to develop the expertise required to offer support, mentoring and training for the codeLab fellows of 23-24.
