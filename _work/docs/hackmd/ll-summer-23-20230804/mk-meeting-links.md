## Adam's HH Blender Globe by Caroline Gage
I made this globe for Adam's Harvard Horizons presentation on military mock villages in the United States and around the world. The globe itself is constructed in Blender, and the glowing dots, which indicate the locations of military mock villages, is a Photoshop overlay. This multi-media project was a big challenge for me that involved many iterations and many learning opportunities. I learned a lot about modifications in Blender, using image textures, and animation to create the globe.

One really basic thing that I practiced with this project was essentially the scientific method, applied to Blender. Making this globe began with me asking questions and figuring out what I wanted to see as well as what Jordan and Adam wanted to see. Next, I tested a lot of different methods, aesthetics, colors, textures, and more to figure out what the best 'look' for the globe would be. That process of trying and revising multiple times was super valuable for me, and I'll use those skills in many projects to come. Another thing I learned was how to work with modifiers in Blender, and how to create a really complex material for an object.
