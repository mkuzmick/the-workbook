## brainstorming
- one the labs (theatre/studio/live/event lab) about facilitating(supporting?) events in the space 
    - mdfs/staff leading events in the space goes beyond the scope of this lab
    - this lab is focused on the live show happening and making sure it's recorded on the right ME
- jessi in the summer, and siriana during the year, seem to be good in the space
- jessi doing some prototypes in the space is the goal for her summer work
- jessi excited about documentation and learning airtable. so maybe connect her with madeleine
- CC + JK figuring out where everything goes
- MPAs doing the technical things
- LLUFs connect in a deeper way, as roles in a backstage crew of a show
- thinking about levels or layers stacking up what we can do capacity-wise. So if we just have the leader of the workshop we will do the lower level of stuff, all the way to if you are the 7th person helping out you do super cool cherry on top stuff 
    - atem switching
    - live stills
    - buttons
    - gifs
- how can we prepare the fellows to do these roles. this is a very collaborative lab, so the learning activities we design could also be 
- mk is excited to work directly with fellows who are excited to work in this lab
- there are types of workshops we do, and then there are mechanics across a wide range of workshops (ie. green paper)


### deliverables

- stack of options for events
    - hierarchy of the possible
    - know if you are the 5th person to arrive what is available for you to do
- training/learning activities for llufs in the lab
- menu of possibilities (for mdfs?)
    - foreground this during orientation/friday meetings?
    - mechanics they can expect from us across different content (i.e., green paper with video playing on it)
- ways to expand the menu of possibilities


## recording things to try while MK is gone
* some stuff macro-based with code
* some visuals on the drive - could we try a couple things like that out
* nice to dedicate between 1 and 3 to the all day mechanics
* with a binder clip, slip of paper and says alldayME and the date. so we know what is there. and then we add in more drives when needed
* after the fact, we determine what footage to keep. and how to hold on to what we want.
* move towards ME1-3 that are running out of the hyperdecks, and in the morning macro those hyperdecks are getting ME1-3 (and having a stack of 3 screens visible so we can visibly see this)
* how to continually make sure it's recording all day?
    * have a camera recording it all day to make sure there is a certain amount of red (joking???)
    * way to do it with code?
* in case of drive failure, we should have a backup drive each day. incase one fails it should kick over to the next drive.
