# Summer Project: aiLab manual

![hero image](link/to/your/hero/image)

## At a Glance
This manual will help MDFs and LLUFs learn about ai as a learning tool. Drawing on MDF Sabrina's materials and integrating what we're learning during the summer of ai at the LL, the aiLab manual will help future fellows teach themselves, their students, and their departments about ai tools and how one might use them (or not) in a higher ed setting.

## Project Details

### Context
* ai is profoundly reshaping our social landscape, including the landscape of higher ed
* ai can provide crucial technical support and insight, shifting what we can reasonably expect students to do in the multimodal projects zone
* * it's important for instructors and students to be aware of what ai can and cannot do
    * and to know what ai tools students might draw on when completing course projects (whether use of ai is sanctioned or not)

### Deliverables 
* a learning path that fellows can follow
* text and media re: what we're learning about ai
* a glossary of key terms in the field
    * relates to MW's ai tools base
