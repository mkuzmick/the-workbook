## messy notes

### course trajectory

- up and running with midjourney
- dall-e? how it works
- survey of generative AI

### course logistics
- google colab

### summer-of-ai
* sabrina & christine (or others, like kevin, etc.) dialogue recordings
* sabrina excited about interviewing folks that she knows
* brainstorming list
    * potentially kevin's friend zoe
    * mk's suggestions:
        * mike smith
        * david malan
        * david cox
    * sabrina's suggestions:
        * Yining Shi - lead engineer at runwayML
        * phillip isola (MIT)
* figure out how to pitch this idea to these folks
    * and how to make it useful for the class
* potential interview themes)
    * what they're doing in their work
    * what they see happening as this unfolds in the higher ed space

### re: the look
* sabrina will provide a brief lecture with slides, and present in front of the green screen
* full screen of code, and then Sabrina smaller on the screen explaining
* our media folks can help source media and create animations
* sabrina would like to customize her slides
* MK says we can work on refining slides even after Sabrina records lectures
* 30 second summary of each video maybe at the main table

### logistics
* Sabrina's email ok
* Dani to send Sabrina available times in the small studio in slack
* Sabrina's time away
    * tentatively July 2-6 conference, and Pakistan in July
    * will cancel in person check ins while Sabrina is gone, but can check in over slack/zoom
* trying to get a good chunk of filming before Sabrina goes, and when she gts back

### miscellaneous
* generative AI visual thought mapping and mood boards
