# skeleton-manual-codeLab
## morning meeting thoughts
things to include maybe:
more basic resources
including visualizing file structure
knowing how to learn and test and troubleshoot
knowing how and when to ChatGPT

## later brainstorming ideas
* getting your development environment going
* git basics
* key terms
* basic documentation 
    * next docs
    * best place to do basic javascript?
        * maybe https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
* good tutorials
    * fireship tutorials
* good starter projects
* next level tutorials (that we assign fellows who are interested, and then they can evaluate the tutorial and make the thing)
* list of things to know and do
* shared resources zone
    * maybe with example airtables that can be used
    * json placeholder thing (maybe our own)
