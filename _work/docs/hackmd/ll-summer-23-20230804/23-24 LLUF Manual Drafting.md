## Levels
[Madeleine came up with awesome cards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpeMCU-aLBA8AVl93DzuU7Tj5vWuFSgWP-T9rm9B990/edit?usp=sharing) that explain this way better, but here's one take on what she came up with! It's not like your role drastically changes as you move up, you are always going to continue to get to do everything-but this can help you see how you can build up to more and more and cooler and cooler stuff the more you put into being a lluf.
1. Tester/Helper. you enter the LL. it's like comping (I grabbed this from google in case anyone is wondering what "comping: is": "This process is called “comp,” which stands for either “competition” or “competence,” depending on whom you ask. It's the standard Harvard term for the semester-long training and assessment that some extracurriculars use to select and prepare new members." ...I totally thought all along it was referring to the comping that happens when you are jamming: "In popular music—most notably jazz—to comp is to play chords and rhythms that provide support for a soloing band member.") this is the bread and butter of the lluf role: you help us make everything we do better by testing it out and giving us your amazing feedback, and you help up keep this magical beast of a studio alive and working with all of your chill organizing, sparkly cleaning, workshop material assembly, etc. you go through your basic training and work on obtaining a lab essentials license.
2. Learner/Tutor. you choose a track. you have completed your "lab essentials license" for a lab and have been invited to join it. you learn more and more. you assist in live events like workshops and office hours as a teaching assistant/peer tutor. you continue to test and help when needed.
3. Builder/Contributor. you have proven yourself in a given tool or set of tools and become a part of a lab project spin off group to work on a larger project. you mostly continue to test and help and learn and tutor but when there is down time you can come in and work on this project. you now have more freedom to come in when you want to. (need system for making sure we have the materials/resources needed or a for them to be able to check on that or know that they have to be cool with not being able to work on something if say all of our computers are needed for a workshop when they come in.)
4. Moonshot. you have proven your mad skills. you have written a proposal for a "moonshot" project and have gotten it signed off on by the LL team and a faculty advisor. successful proposals for moonshots will likely be aligned with your junior tutorial or senior thesis project.


## Shifts
1. the pod shift (or basic training and then office hours shift). we can have them sign up maybe? give them some times and have them give us their top 3 or something like that and then we can assign from there?
    * staff: one of us would "dock" with each pod and act as mentor of sorts, checking in during basic training and being the back up during office hours. making sure they have a really good sense of support and are seen. we should get to know them super well and work towards connecting their desires and specialness to our projects that will draw more of that out. we can totally cover for each other, especially in office hours as hopefully there will be plenty of folks in the place to help with those.

2. studio assistance shifts. we could have regular studio assisntance shifts that each have 4 slots, and we "open" them up on a certain day each week and llufs sign up. we could set a policy around showing up? if they decide not to do it with more than 24 hours, then they take themself off of the list and slack the lluf community to see if anyone wants to pick it up? if they no show or drop within 24 hours more than 3 times, maybe we bump them or theres a time period that they aren't invited to sign up?
    * staff: make the checklists and tasks clear and obvious and easy to do. have any materials or resources needed easy to find. be available for any clarify or directional questions.

3. live events and design labs. less predictable-will range from week to week depending on our needs. we can have a menu of whats on deck somewhere and llufs can throw their name in the hat for that event? otherwise we can invite llufs we think would be a good fit.
    * staff: whoever is in charge of the event has the final say in who is invited to help and also is the point person for directing the specifics of what kind of assistance would be most valuable (jk will obviously also help)


## Scheduling
Level 1 & 2 LLUFs:

you will sign up for one recurring 2 hour shift. (the pod--which will become an office hours time after completion of basic training). You will share this shift with 2 to 3 other llufs. you will complete all of our LL essentials, or basic training. this is an agreement that you will come to that shift every week.

you will be able to sign up for additional studio assistance shifts. (do we limit how many? do we let the higher levels sign up first?)


Level 3 & 4 LLUFs:
you are required to maintain your pod/OH shift time.

you have the flexibilty to come in to work on your projects anytime in person during our open times. you will have an allotment of hours (and a timeline for completion) outlined in your project contract and it is up to you when to use them.
