## need to add in/figure out
* AI
    * how do these tools help us make in media rep'd in the labs
    * how does it work for different domains
    * what's happening to writing/academic knowledge in light of changes in AI/tools
* who does what
* let other activities breathe
    * like multimodal basics stuff
    * scaffolding
* last thursday is studio day instead of grading/responding
* think about ways for them to make docs, do a weekly update, etc.

## schedule edit notes
* day 1: articulating the problem/puzzle (backward design)
    * what backwards design is
    * what language of learning objectives means
    * then connect this to most sophisticated thing they can do - connect to disciplines, what do experts do and what has been magical about academic writing for a generation as a means of learning
    * on horizon is this AI threat but also ease of producing media 
* day 2: now let's look at bunch of different things and think about how they're in alignment with your disciplines (forward design)
* second week would be more about what we can do for them with our space and resources, and what they can do here

## maybe things that can wait for friday meetings
* responding and celebrating
