        - graphic design (including posters, slides, graphical abstracts, paper)
    - the project labs?
        - ai
        - realtime production?
* including documentation process
    * how often to do things
    * what would those things would be

## labs lists

- core

    - ai
    - academic presentation
    - realtime production
    - games?
    - animation?
    - music?

## structure (messy notes)
* no requirement that labs meet syncronously - they're mostly slack channels
    * there could be a synchronous meeting that MDF leading the lab should be able to go to
* returner mdfs will be required to post in lab slack channels
* CD&JK responsible for knowing which mdfs/llufs are in and what they're doing
* goal is: learning project that we decide and is totally defined + getting ready for office hours
    * what comes next will vary depending on the lab
* spring is for moonshot projects (or trying a new lab?)
* should feel like a class - a project-based, self-directed class
* partnered work on learning projects? but making sure everyone is learning
* toolTimes as a way for staff/fellows to teach other folks in different labs what they're learning in the labs
    * can create asynchronous tutorials
    * cool to be iteration built into toolTimes - reflection post first toolTime, but then teach again etc.


## notes on specific labs
* studio lab - involves those who teach and run workshops, and also the stage hands and studio maintenance/cleaning

## documentation
* what do we want to require for fellows?
* dd to create a doc for us to collectively work in
    * records (data we need)
        * all the things that people have made
        * some kind of thing-related report (when you make the thing, you write)
        * some time-based report (weekly report or something)
            * how do we get some media or at least links attached to it
        * include numbers and people needed for annual report
        * reviewing these and figuring out whether we want to get them to talk about at the main table with MK, use on social media, etc.
    * mechanics
    * frequency
    * view layer
        * timeline
        * printing 
* figure out storing/hosting the media so links can be used
## to do
* think about initial learning activity for each of the 5 core labs (MK is excited about this)
* what do the additional resources look like
* figure out what the pieces should be for the manuals and the most efficient way of collecting them
* JK/CD responsible for giving manuals to their fellows
* returner mdfs
    * CD will check in with mdfs
        * studio/theatre/event: siriana
        * reality: chris
        * graphic design: emily
        * av: ?
        * code: anna
* figure out fellow structure
    * mdf orientation time and structure
    * lluf pods
* figure out office hours structure
    * appointments?
* toolTimes (internal vs. external)
* dd to create the meta all labs hackMD book
    * llufs and mdf facing chunks of it, a lot of shared resource docs, logistics etc. etc.
