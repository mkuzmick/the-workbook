# codeLab-initial-learning-project-draft

- what is this lab?
- some examples from the real world
- why would this be valuable in a academic / teaching and learning environment?
- some ideas for this (things the LL has done or might want to do more of)

## The Tools

Learning how to code and then using code to build websites and apps requires many tools.

For the app we'll build first, knowing these tools will be helpful:
* javascript
    * [codecademy js tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* next.js
    * here's a tutorial that walks through how to [create a next app](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)
* airtable
    * [an overview of airtable](https://www.airtable.com/guides/start/airtable-basics)
    * [an sample airtable](https://airtable.com/app8kRRfha0CQ1hG2?) that anna and christine made for their personality quiz prototypes
    * [using airtable personal access tokens](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens)
        * this will be useful once you're trying to connect your app to an airtable base
* css
    * [linkedin learning css tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3)
    * [next.js styling doc](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling)

## The Initial Learning Project
- what is the initial learning project?
    - a personality quiz that passes in data from an airtable, logs user responses, and then connects to openAI (ex., by asking "based on these responses, which ten movie characters am I like?")
- what tools will I be learning?
    - js
    - next.js
    - airtable
    - css, tailwind, other styling languages you choose
- what do I need to build and share? when?
- some pathways (at a high level)
    - include visualization of a file structure here?
- at least one really granular step-by-step or sped-up screen capture
- lab logistics
    - codeLab leaders
        - Anna Ivanov: senior MDF (Slavic)
        - Christine: assistant director of the LL
    - slack channel
