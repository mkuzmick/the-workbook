# LL Basics

Fellows begin with a set of onboarding challenges to orient or in the case of returning fellows, re-orient themselves to the LL. For fellows who have been around for a while can road test these modules and help us refine them, so they still have the shared experience even if they’re already familiar with a lot of this

## 3 goals

1. Ensure everyone gets LL Basic Training in a structured and systematic way
2. Give folks stuff to do as we get to know them and start to connect them to projects (and they get to know us)
3. Make sure we have headshots/bios/other website material shortly after hires and in the process make sure everyone talks on camera in their first few days

## Common questions to address:
* how do i log on to computers, ipads and apps (ex.studio google account)?
* where do i save things?
* where can i find x?
* what do i do when i come in? how can i help?
