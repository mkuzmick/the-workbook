# realityLab initial learning project

- should involve an array of tools (not JUST blender or JUST Unity, but a little bit of the pipeline)
- ideally we see 2-3+ ways of viewing any 3d asset I create (like AE comp that AV people might do, a live show move using Unreal, maybe a Unity game? maybe just an awesome still rendered out of Blender, etc.)
- last year's learning project was to make an annotated map in Blender
- would be cool to connect to Belle Lipton's map thing maybe?
- @sophie is psyched about Unreal and Unity, but also blender
- has done rigging
- python vis in Blender
- infographic type things
- interaction mechanics
    - CV-driven?
- ai backgrounds
- 3d presentation aid/virtual stage/environment for: virtual gallery of artworks, annotated map, etc. 
    - remix the jobs thing or remixing something we've done 2d in the past
    - using a dataset would be great. christine and sophie connect about this (maybe christine can ask belle too). can also use projects from horizons

### the prompt

[reality-lab-initial-learning-project-draft](/GzStfSLoSu6ih0F_apxUgQ)

Using at least Blender, but hopefully other tools too, design a 3d visualization that would help you teach something you could imagine students learning in a Harvard classroom. This could be an annotated 3d object, a map or landscape, a 3d infographic, a 3d data visualization, etc.
- the project should involve some animation (for instance an animated camera leading us through the animation or animated elements that slowly build up the complexity of the scene)
- we will teach you how to "deliver" the 3d assets for a variety of platforms, and you should try out at least 2 (threejs, simple blender-render, printed graphic, AE scene, AR, VR, Unreal scene in the LL studio, etc)
- if you can't think of anything, feel free to remix a 2d example that we use frequently in the learning lab (a famous TED talk, a Horizons slide, a Vox video element, etc.)
- try to log your steps so that others can follow along and learn from you
- share your work as you go in show-your-work and in the lab channel

note: we need to really emphasize XR delivery if this is realityLab and not 3D lab? or this can just be 3d lab?

## additional learning project ideas

### stylized globe animation
* start with the chris folder of globe assets and blender file
* edit the material in Ps and bring in to blender

### name drop

## messy notes 20230717
* considerations: 
    * we want to be doing unity and unreal and augmenting the live show
    * we have a constant need for 3d work around HH time
    * everything we do should be connected to academic communication somehow
    * initial learning project should take between 4 weeks at the minimum, and at most 2 months
* some ideas
    * generating things in blender. if we want to, displaying them in different zones 
        * (ultimatte stuff is connected to many labs. realityLab can provide assets and templates, avLab will set it up, but the studioLab folks should know how to manipulate that)
    * see created assets displayed different ways

## messy notes 20230804
* use the prompt from above and then flesh out the parts of the project, add in resources, add in the examples we make ourselves
* we'd like to do - 
    * something from the sciences (data vis, numbers), 
    * something from the humanities (maybe ideas or humanities type visuals like maps, artworks, sculptures, building)
* potential project options
    * use quantitative dataset for datavis in blender (or Blender + Unity)
    * obtain a relevant 3d model of your data (by modeling, scanning, or stealing/borrowing) and manipulate, annotate, orbit, build interactions, etc
    * work with a 2d map (of space, time or concepts) and annotate/animate/interact?
* our ILP could have baby versions of those above 3 options

### action items
* mk and sophie will find examples of the project options
    * sophie will make some
    * mk may look for previous things we've made
* dd will set up a time for sophie and marlon to talk 
    * then text -> transcript -> writing
* sophie will work on links
    * one they'll use
    * beyond the ones we really work with - maya houdini 3dsmax c4d
