mk will help us define the initial learning project, but in the meantime, let's list out project ideas we could imagine helping folks learn coding basics, connecting to airtable, etc.

## lab goals
* getting things up on the web quickly
* student interactions in the studio that use an app/obs/etc
* gain baseline knowledge of tools in LL system that use code
    * Unity
    * Blender
    * video stuff?
    * atem/macros
* how to read code/understand what tools like chatGPT are giving you
    * code literacy
    * knowing when chatGPT is being overly complicated or doing something in a weird way
* learn to how collab on github

## project ideas
* personality quiz
* student project or mdf portfolio
    * coding for the web
    * virtual gallery as another model for this
* data visualizations with coding
    * anna did an activity with Julie's course in this vein
    * connected to DH
    * and coding literacy
    * activity where you brainstorm different things TO visualize
* a mapping project that connects to Belle's tutorial
* interactive timeline
* simple blog site with video, audio, image, etc. - different types of media
    * to think about hosting and where these things get pulled from
* accessibility and coding
    * adding tags for screen readers
    * maybe connect with DAS at some point again during the term
    * what are the considerations when you don't have accessibility checkers of, say, Canvas


## other things
* how to connect to other labs
    * esp. reality, studio
