# make-it-square

We create a lot of squares and rectangles in the LL: cards, 11x17 paper, boxes made of truss. A key skill to learn is how to take a photo of something with right angles that PRESERVES all of those right angles.  For this simple challenge, create a composition comprised of right angles and take a photo with your phone that eliminates all “keystoning” (the convergence, in the photo, of lines that are meant to be parallel).
