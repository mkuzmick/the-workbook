## notes: 

Based on current [BOK page](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/artificial-intelligence) format: 

Assignments that relate to each level of (active) ai integration: 

1. Outflank the technology
2. Lean into the technology
    * tool breakdowns like above 

Longer projects: 
* Making music 
* Animate with AI (https://youtu.be/_9LX9HSQkWo) 
* A series on ai tools vs traditional tools

## moonshot content pieces


* elevate typical student projects 
    * "instead of this... do this" 
        * from the POV of students
            * presenting on a person from history 
                * create a chat bot on charcater ai
                * have a chat transcript in interview format 
                * use an ai deepfake to animate the dead person's portrait 
                * use an audio ai to make a voice 
                    * your presentation is a "live interview" instead of a typical presentation
            * writing a paper with ai 
                * showing how to not plagiarize, but to use various AI tools to make a stronger work 

* old school vs. new school 
    * marlon v madeleine 
        * traditional tools versus ai tools 

* animation using the workflow from [this video](https://youtu.be/_9LX9HSQkWo) 

* have people make ai versions of two staff members (marlon and madeleine, marlon and christin, etc). 
    * Use a chatbot, install a personality + example responses. 
    * have a midjourney avatar
    * then let the chosen staff members come with prepared questions that we feed the chatbot then animate 
        * (similar to marlon's videos of Marx on slack)

* can we vote out the ai?
    * a play on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKPP20rvp3s). 

* a new era of catfishing/impersonation 
    * make tinder accounts with AI generated people 
        * AI images, that maybe we tweak 
        * all responses are ai generated, and we see how far we get 

* AI detection 
    * a paper written by ai, a paper written by ai then tweaked, a paper written by kevin, a paper written by MPAs
        * graded by marlon. 
        * marlon trying to figure out which paper is which 

* AI throughout time 
    * a highly-produced history lesson on AI, a la vox. 
        * inspired by Emilio's HH presentation and Anna's scrollytelling which both featured golems-- an early concept of human-created intelligence/beings. 
            
            
* AI versus professionals 
    * chatGPT vs. therapists 
    * chatGPT vs. poets 
        * kevin 
    * ai lawyer vs. law student/lawyer 
    * chatGPT vs. doctor 
        * eana?


* lesson plans 
    * a la kevin's [lesson plan test](https://shareg.pt/ExyIq5c)

## shorter content prompts for everyone


* misc
    * make avatars on an ai video that represents you in your favorite fictional world 
        * go through whole team 
            * end on sohpie, who will undoubtedly have a spooky creature as an avatar 
                * this is campy/character-based, so expectation subversion is key here 
    * guessing the book based on the midjourney image of the setting 
        * lean into where AI goes wrong. 
            * we're not just showing the capabailities, but also the weaknesses. 
    * the name game/"who am I?" but with ai 
        * people are given an ai image, generated from their partner's prompt. the goal is to get there as fast as possible. each turn can be a tweak or addition to the prompt. 
            * two teams competing against one another 
            * commentary of techniques around prompts. 
    * matching the vector image to the term 
        * Sabrina's "how an ai sees a dog" image, but scrambled. 
            * all as a cover to explain the underlying mechanic/technology 


* tutorial + riff
    * how to on an AI tool  
        * plus 3-5 ideas in a class for how to use 
            * applications to courses we're working with?

* news roundup 
    * new developments from this week 
        * sort based on theme

* theme, move, topic, mechanic, etc. 
    * i.e. Podcasts 
        * "seven tools to help with podcasting" 
    * other examples: 
        * research papers, design, photo editing, etc. 
        * a funny one would be a law ai versus a harvard law student 
            * do we know anyone? the algorithm would eat this up. 

* interviews 
    * with famous historical figures, or figures pit against one another 
        * a la [AI Philosophy is Weirdly Profound](https://youtu.be/wves5FsVUXA)

* storyboarding with ai 
    * similar to jessi's film party, as teams we get themes and have to storyboard using only ai 
        * ai writes a basic storey outline 
        * charcater design 
        * set design 
        * story beats
            * put it all together 


* adobe ai filter 
    * use ai to generate a face 
    * split it up into layers per the needs of the adobe program 
    * run it
