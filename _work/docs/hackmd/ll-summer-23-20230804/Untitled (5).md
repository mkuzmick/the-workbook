## draft msg

we are so excited to start another year with all of you! 

because you're so central to everything we do here, and because you're going to take on more of a leadership role in the labs, we wanted to launch the labs with you during the week of August 14!

The goals for this week are to:
* think together about the LL basics for MDFs (what are the things that MDFs need to know, think about, be able to do, etc.)
* launch each of the core labs for 2023/2024, designing an initial learning project with your LL staff lab co-leader and create some initial documentation that will help other folks learn
* design an activity that uses the LL studio to teach us in the form your lab is focused on

Here's what we're thinking as a schedule for that week:
* Monday, August 14 at 9 am
    * we all meet up in the LL studio to launch the week
    * and have coffee!
* Tuesday, August 15 and Wednesday, August 16
    * you and your LL staff co-leader will decide when to work together on your plans for the lab (both the initial learning project and the teaser activity that will help others know what that lab is "about")
* Thursday, August 17
    * at 9, we have coffee!
    * 10, 11, 1 pm, 2pm, 3pm
        * each lab pairining will run us through a 45-minute activitiy that helps us learn in the particular form your lab is organized around
