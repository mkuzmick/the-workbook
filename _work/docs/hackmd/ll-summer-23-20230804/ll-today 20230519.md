## solved:

- skeleton of codeLab manual or resources
    - more basic resources
    - including visualizing file structure
    - knowing how to learn and test and troubleshoot
    - knowing how and when to ChatGPT
- updates
    - what are the steps or moments so far that are worth reporting? 
- logging in to each others' apps and pulling from APIs (as potential mechanic for codeLab or workshops next year)
- quick thinking about next next steps (for June 5 on)
