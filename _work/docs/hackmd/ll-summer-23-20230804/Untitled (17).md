## email for professors we don't know:

Subject: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning’s Learning Lab
Hi _____,

We’re writing because we supported ______ in their creative capstone project this past [fall or spring] semester for _______ and we wanted to see if you’d be interested in consulting with us.

At the Learning Lab, we collaborate with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. When ___ reached out to us, we were able to help them because we had extra availability, but if you’d like to meet up over zoom, we’d be thrilled to know if we can support more of your students. We often host a workshop (or a series of workshops) launching creative assignments and also host drop-in office hours for multimedia assignments. You can see a little more about what we do here: https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab

Please let us know! 
All best,

Hi _____,

We’re writing because we supported ______ in their creative capstone project this past [fall or spring] semester for _______ and we wanted to see if you’d be interested in meeting with us regarding support for this specific course in the future.

While you have already collaborated with the Learning Lab, we’d be thrilled to know if we can support more of your students. We typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. When ___ reached out to us, we were able to help them because we had extra availability. However, if you’d like to meet up over zoom, we’d be thrilled to come up with new ways to approach this course that either overlap or expand on the ways we've worked with you in the past. For a quick reminder on the range of our support, check out our website: https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab

We hope you're enjoying your summer!

All best,
