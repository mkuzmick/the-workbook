# midjourney matching v.1


## intro

So, we’ve all seen ai-generated  images. 


Today, they’re everywhere...

and they are probably the first piece of generative ai content most people saw. 



AI art started to hit mainstream social media in the spring and summer of 2022, but it became a major conversation after

Today, we'll be using an activity to explore the strengths an d weaknesses of the most widely-known ai image generator:

/Midjourney/

We'll be matching quotes from five shakespeare plays:

Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Midusmmer Nights Dream, Macbeth,and King Lear

... to the image generated from said quote.

## outro 

As you can see, syntax was a huge issue. We were actually the most efficient when only presented with the images. 

This is interesting, as the midjourney prompts never featured the play names. When fed the play names, the generated images were too obvious:

Yet, we were going off of plot points and guessing the quotes. The quotes themselves ended up confusing us a bit. 

And this comes down to how prompting works on midjourney: 


some ai understands long commands, that are linguistically complex. It can parse the syntax of a demand, to clearly understand what you DONT and DO want

But midjourney does not "think" in the way ai chatbots do. It doesn't understand complex commands, but uses simplistic syntax (red + dog) to "dream." These dreams result in complex, fractal-like images that you can tweak with stylistic cues.
