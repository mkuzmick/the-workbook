1. Course:
    * landmarks of world architecture

2. Brand attributes: 
    * Classic
    * Creative
    * Dynamic
    * Multi-cultural
    * Historic
    * Sophisticated

3. Research of industry/companies related to the course content to get an ideas of the branding terrain made in Fresco:

4. Wordmark designs:
    * in Ai, set up a landscape 11 x 17 page
    * type in the name in any typeface, and duplicate 5 across and 8 down so you have 40 names total per page
    * make each column a different font and each row a different layout option (see image below)
        * .Ai file in slack channel (ll-uf-emmy-s)

5. Selected 4 "top candidates" from the 40 above and edited them in individual artboards to make Wordmark options:

## Color

6. I created a color palette for the course. Below is my process/justification:


* I wanted to represent the vast array of colors, styles and time periods of the landmarks covered throughout the course by incorporating colors from contrasting architectural works, such as a yellow tone from the pyramids of Gyza and a pop of red from Bauhaus. 
* Focusing on just one color from the samples to build the palette around, I chose Bauhaus red (#ED1C24) because it represents many of the brand attributes of the course identified (dynamic, creative) and maintained black and white as neutrals. 
* Using the primary color and Adobe Color, I created a five color palette using the Triad Harmony rule, which gave me shades of blue, yellow and maroon that represent the other landmarks I was hoping to incorporate (pyramids, John Hancock tower) that better compliment the primary Bauhaus shade of red and meet accessibility contrast standards against the neutrals (black and white). Note: secondary colors were adjusted slightly to meet accessibility standards. One of the complimentary secondary tones was too similar to the initial shade of red, so I replaced it with a brown shade from the original image samples.

## Adobe Fresco Notes:

#### how to import image onto artboard:
- save photo to camera roll
- select the image icon on the lefthand sidebar

- the image should appear in your artboard as its own layer where you can move it, resize it, etc.
- click “done in the upper righthand corner to finish inserting the image
- if you want to move your image around after importing it, select the image layer on the righthand side or use the lasso tool to draw around it. Then, click the transform tool from the lefthand toolbar (or bottom if using lasso tool)

#### using the brush tool to annotate:
- select the “vector brushes” tool from the lefthand toolbar
- explore the brush types and pick one you would like to use

## Dalal's notes on graphic design process
1. gather info from interviewing clients
2. sketch out logo options first in procreate (timelapse videos, animation functions)
3. bring into illustrator
4. digitize favorite options
5. from logo build out the rest of the graphic system by incorporating elements of it throughout
    * ex. Coca cola swoosh is used throughout their other branding (commercials, posters, etc.)
    * using the same line weight throughout
7. make several options of each because its subjective (client wants to choose)
8. old school packaging design - make physical model, translate to illustrator, find mock up image online and transpose 
    * new AI tool in illustrator where you can bring in any picture and put your graphic on top of it and it will make the mockup
9. final brandbook in Indesign
