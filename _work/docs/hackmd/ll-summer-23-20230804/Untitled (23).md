## three types of summer activity

- processing the ways in which generative AI tools will impact the courses, projects and assignments we already support
    - multimodal academic communication for teachers and scholars
    - multimodal assignments for students
- thinking about how these AI tools will render new modes of academic creation possible for faculty, grads and undergrads
- using AI tools to improve our own work (consultation, media production, workshop and event facilitation)
    - open ai api research and proofs of concept
    - now 80% of the staff capable of writing basic python and js scripts


## some bullets

- started to support innovations, and the bulk of the work ended up taking the form of multimodal assignments. The basic idea being that what it means to communicate is shifting rapidly, and moving beyond text alone. So what comes next?
- much of what we used to do is now way easier. So much easier that's it's not clear we should still get paid for doing it.
- so what can we do instead?
- we've always worked with faculty to think of ways at getting to what really matters to them, removing unnecessary technical difficulty (do they reallyl need to know video editing? or can they show two photos and talk?)

## august

- MDF orientation


"Students with a range of technical expertise can use LLMs, which can be prompted to produce code, to create electronic literature and digital writing."
