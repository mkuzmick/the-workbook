# mk-airtable-thoughts-summer-23

Some quick thoughts for Dani to get started with

## high level overview

There are two main types of "central" reference bases:

1. relatively unchanging unique ID, term, and data providers. The bases that hold on to everyone's names and basic info, bases that hold the abbreviations of all of Harvard's courses by term. Tables of key LL terms for labs, media, forms and tools.
2. constantly changing and updated work and event tracking bases: bases that log all appointments, all shoots, all the projects for a given term, all of the fellows working during a given term (though these will link back to bases of type 1)


Then there are multiple work-centric bases:




## in response to mk's high level overview
* how can i update the projects base, right now it is kind od doing both of the two main types above
* so this is like:
    * 1. LL central hub, which has
        * Users
        * Metaprojects?/Clients?
        * ProjectNames?
        * ProjectTypes?
        * Tools
        * Forms
        * _PEOPLE
    * 2. changing LL wide bases
        * Events 23-24
        * Projects 23-24
        * PhotoVideo 23-24
        * Tasks 23-24?
        * MDF
        * LLUF
    * 3. more specific bases for regions of work
        * bases for each labs
        * single serving bases for projects
* where do documents go? where does show your work go?
## dd other things
* "places to aggregate individuals work in a zone that makes sense to them" - for mk, one base where looks at things. one base where sc looks at things. etc.
from jk to discuss with mk
* hub base system for this year - jk asked about ExperimentalHub
* tagging projects with labs so we can add to their satellite bases (multiselect? user?)
* Base for the things marlon does
* Q&A base (mostly for fellows and MPAs) - exist in fellows bases or just in general?

## messy notes 20230711
project proposals and activity proposals will both go in project base; event base will be more like robotic-google-cal replacement
