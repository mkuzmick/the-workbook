# writing about AI

## questions
* what form should writing about AI take?
    * what constitutes a blog post about an AI tool?
* how can we--as the LL--articulate what it does?
    * the rhetorical moves
* what is the relationship between the writing about AI and content intended for social media?

## forms
* visuals
* couple of short paragraphs of text
* link to social media counterpart (if there is one)
* links to tutorials
* links to research/further reading/references?

## rhetorical moves
* democratizing technical skills (e.g., coding/webdev)
* AI challenges the idea of the single-authored work in visual realm esp. (long-held as an important critical intervention from humanists)
* helping students do more ambitious multimedia projects
* helping students get into the content of those projects rather than getting hung up on technical stuff
* help students prepare for careers that will integrate AI tools and workflows (future workforce stuff)
* should know how to interpret AI results (i.e., learn how to fact check, how to use it in an ethical and professional manner - like learning how to use research generally!)

## models
* [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research blog](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/)
* [distill blog](https://distill.pub/)

## notes
* blogs a good place to:
    * create static representations of visual data (e.g., explaining what the AI applied from a literary text to a visual in Midjourney)
    * create + unpack new data visualizations that synthesize what was learned from an AI experiment captured on film/that's otherwise visual in nature
    * report on what's happening in the AI space
        * which could then maybe link to short videos that show how some tool works
        * like a roundup
    * reflect on our individual learning journeys using AI tools/metacognitive reflections on a specific project or something we can do now that we couldn't before
        * or maybe even something we couldn't get AI to do that shows its limitations 
        * lean into the storytelling aspect of blogging/like features writing in a mag or newspaper
    * really lean into the public-facing component, foregrounding our lack of technical/engineering/coding expertise as a value-add in the space of AI tool exploration and using it as a tool for thinking and learning
        * most of the blogs I've seen so far are very technical, very much foregrounding the work a lab is doing to develop AI capabilities
