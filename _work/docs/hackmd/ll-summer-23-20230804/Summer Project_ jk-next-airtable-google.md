## At a Glance

This project prompts me to learn how to integrate airtable into a next app, authenticated by a google sign in. Along the way, I will also create some licensing/badging materials for llufs who want to join codeLab.

###### tags: nextjs, airtable, codeLab, lluf, web-portfolio, authentication

## Project Details

### Context

* we need to provide llufs with training materials as a licensing program for joining codeLab
* we sometimes may want to deploy a web app that is driven by our airtable data but is not wildly public. 

### Deliverables 
* lluf codeLab licensing materials
* method for next.js + airtable + google for limiting access to a web app


### Outcomes and Next Steps
* If I succeed, we will have a method for using google emails that are stored in our database and google sign in authentication for access to our web apps.

* the first thing I'll make is a simple portfolio app in next.js that can be made by llufs and done as part of their codeLab license.
* I will connect a simple airtable to that app as the next step
* I will

### Timeline
* the project will start during next.js sprint week!
* I will try to have some part of it done by Friday to show everyone!
