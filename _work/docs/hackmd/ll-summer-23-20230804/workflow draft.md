all referencing [this airtable](https://airtable.com/appitFkleGG0PVGlW/tblcpNyhT05jMhr3O/viwRyIxnlPymYjWev?blocks=hide)

## STEP ONE: 

* table location: [pitches](https://airtable.com/appitFkleGG0PVGlW/tblcpNyhT05jMhr3O/viwRyIxnlPymYjWev?blocks=hide) 
* individual instruction: fill out pitch form, or the fields within the table directly, to the best of your ability. while many fields are self-explanatory, pay special attention to the fields listed below:
    * PitchType: 
        * story
            * use this type if the content covers a shoot done in the course of normal LL operations
        * event
            * use this type if the content requires a novel shoot or prep done solely for social media
        * series 
            * use this type if the content is part of a larger series
                * i.e. "lessons plans" or "weekly news roundups "
    * PitchStatus 
        * enter all pitches as "greenlit"
* next steps: 
    * the team will review new pitches on a weekly basis. pitches that are greenlit and prioritized for filming within the next two weeks are moved to the "MediaContent" table by the media lead (madeleine). 

## STEP TWO: 

* table location: [ContentProduction](https://airtable.com/appitFkleGG0PVGlW/tblV3nfLupvujYQ0j/viwAcieRWeYxv0lb0?blocks=hide) 
* individual instruction: once greenlit, projects will be moved to this table, then filled out to prepare for filming and editing. 
    * YOU MUST: 
        * link the new record to the original pitch
        * set the status to "planning"
        * other fields are optional for all but media lead (madeleine).
* next steps: 
    * the team will work to film the content
    * once filmed, the staus will be changed to "filmed" 
        * note: some content pieces may be scrapped or put on hold. adjust status accordingly
    * content, once filmed, will then be moved to the "Edits" table. 

## STEP THREE: 

* table location: [Edits](https://airtable.com/appitFkleGG0PVGlW/tblkOdA6Y61pIhcv9/viwEDYrbOQq3q3leo?blocks=hide) 
* individual instruction: this is where the media team is alerted, so they can execute edits and return them for posting.
    * YOU MUST: 
        * set the task type and requested output 
            * most will be "60 to 15" and then ".drp"
        * link the shoot and event fields
        * go to the "PaperEditDocs" field and click on the googe sheets
            * complete paper edits for the media team, using the google link 
                * found in the google sheet or shoot lookup 
    * THEN set the status to "TO DO"
        * this sends an automated message to the media director and coordinator (casey and sophie)
    * all these steps create a complete package for the media team to use for efficient edits
* next steps: 
    * the media team will complete the edits and post to URL in the table
        * this will send an automatic alert to the media lead (madeleine)
        * the media lead will then either ask for more edits or approve the cut as a final
    * the status will be changed to "Done"
    * then the final cut will be moved to "Posts" and split into it's many types 
        * two categories: 
            * form: longform, short, images
            * posting place: instagram, tiktok, youtube, next.js, canvas

* table location: [PostSchedule](https://airtable.com/appitFkleGG0PVGlW/tblR2fukDpuPmSVjn/viwC6Qm1x4JRHaJ2P?blocks=hide) 
* individual instruction: this is where content is reviewed, approved, then posted 
    * YOU MUST:
        * name the entry, with the intended posting place and form 
        * link the "Edits" field
        * set the "PublishingPlace"
        * enter a draft of the copy. 
    * THEN set the status to "Ready for Review"
        * this will send an automated alert to leadership to approve the content 
            * marlon for most posts, jordan for LLUF content, christine for MDF content
* next steps: 
    * once approved, media will be posted on the assigned place. 
    * then, update the "Date" field and "URL" field to relfect the post
