## core labs
* reality
* av
* code
* studio/event/theatre
* graphics

## lab goals for mdfs
* learn tools needed for projects
* develop expertise in media relevant to discipline/department
* collaborate with MDFs and LLUFs and come up with amazing and complex prototypes and activity ideas!
* practice teaching
* be ready to support LL office hours

## things they should make
* resources for students, future MDFs and LLUFs
* prototypes for their departments and for projects like HH
* really cool media for reporting + storytelling

## learning arc
* fall: learning projects, very concrete
    * then maybe they spin off into smaller pairs or even individually to build asynch and share on slack
    * one project per month? with end of the month deadline/all LL show + tell (mdfs + LLUFS)
    * one toolTime per project? one thing you learned = one thing you teach the rest of us
    * link these projects to things we need for courses (way for MDFs to propose lab projects in airtable form?)
    * toolTimes for other grads
* spring: moonshot project that's super ambitious
    * cross-lab collabs
    * design a component of the final showcase, an exhibition that requires all the lab media forms

## returning mdfs
* take leadership role in one lab
    * coordinate lab meetings whenever those are happening
        * even just sending a slack to see if people want to meet to work together during a given week
* keep the lab channel discourse going by posting links to relevant things
* kick off toolTimes at start of fall term?
* reporting on the labs
    * collecting links from slack
        * tutorials
        * things people have made
    * where do these go? airtable? hackMD?
    * once a month friday event
        * for feedback
        * and show and tell
* propose projects for their lab
    * work on this during week 0
    * make, show, teach

## things to make to support labs
* way to quickly get a view of what they're making
    * slack to
        * next.js site
        * timeline
        * something printable for physical space
* quick way to propose lab project
    * slack modal?
    * airtable form feels too formal and potentially time-consuming unless very bare bones
    * or maybe somewhere in the physical space where you can tack up like a manifesto lol like luther
