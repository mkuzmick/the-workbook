what they can get from us, resources that are here
last year mdfs hit their stride halfway thru and wanted to know the capabilities sooner
so week 2: more specific to LL studio
week 1: broad professional development/teaching and learning


studio-
* maybe start with a few technical things (chroma key, luma key things)
* foreground that when we do table - it's about isolating a move that we've just discussed on thursday (scaffolding - this becomes scaffolding for multimodal presentation they'll do in next session)
    * think in broad terms of capacities of the studio - one thing we often do is we isolate functional moves in a medium we're working with and we design an activity around that
        * round-robin 3 x 3 table with greatest hits
    * this preps them for thursday because they can use these on thursday
