## what needs to get done **on FINAL CUT -- not davinci or premiere

- [ ] time markers for each question
- [ ] compound clips for each question (multiple answers in one compound)
- [ ] split screen for each compound clip (some questions will be asked in all 3 sessions, some in only 2, and some in only 1 - don't need split screen for questions that are only asked once)
