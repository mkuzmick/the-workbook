# summer-23-slack-app-notes

q: do we need an s23 slack app? or should we just build from within the existing do-your-work and show-your-work apps?

## new slashes


### `/slaunch`

- launches a summer project
    - creates a record in the airtable base
    - creates a hackmd in the summer base
    - 

### `/sshow`

- inputs a show-your-work? but then it can't have images? paste in URL of image? or of object?
- maybe this just gives you the option of selecting some recently posted images?


### app home

- should we use this for anything in particular?
- 


## how to make a slack app from scratch

- create a github repo with a node `.gitignore`
- then follow [these instructions](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started)
- 


in your .env you want 
* Slack Bot Token
* User Bot token
* Signing Secret
* Slack App Token
* Airtable Base
* Airtable Api
* Default Image
* Hackmd api token
* Hackmd team id
