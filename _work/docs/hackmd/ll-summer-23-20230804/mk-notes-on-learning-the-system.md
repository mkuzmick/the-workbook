# mk-notes-on-learning-the-system

We can never teach everything. Perhaps we never should teach anything. 

So what we need to do is to help people learn. And, most crucially, we need to help them learn how to learn.

Here are some notes in this direction.

## secret notes for fellow learning groups next year

- start by trying to understand what it is you're trying to learn
    - pinterests
    - tool comparisons
- read (and learn) the manual
- go slow
- document your steps
- repeat ...everything ..all the time
- have a target
- make sure your target is going to force you to learn the key elements of the tool
- take breaks
- find a good youtube or LinkedIn Learning tutorial
    - at least one that's like a textbook
    - at least one that's a "here's how to make this one cool thing"
- it's OK not to know (and, when learning in a group, err on the side of sounding like you don't entirely know what you're talking about--knowing = knowing, not cultivating ability to perform mastery)
- don't stop learning when you get the thing to work (why does it work? is it going to keep working if you vary certain properties that your intuition tells you might mess it up?)
- it's like learning a language or a dance rather than a series of true propositions (again: this is why learning to say the right sentences with confidence is the LEAST important thing)
