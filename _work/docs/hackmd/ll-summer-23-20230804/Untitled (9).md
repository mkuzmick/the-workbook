## what we've done in the past
* distance diaries & the final reflection package
* posting in show-your-work every shift
* eoy video interviews
* end of term galleries & showcases
* individual channels on slack
* work submission on airtable
* activity response forms on airtable (the old activity base)
* friday lunch show & tell meetings with cards ("i did" & "up next")
* pod multimedia weekly reports
* hackMD notes on progress (this was lluf-initiated, not a system we enforced)
* for storing: 
    * google drive folders
    * 11 x 17 folders
    * jars of cards
    * the octopus of sdx drives
* rave reviews board lol
* not us, but this is the [bi-weekly reporting form that PFs use](https://airtable.com/shrcJoDcESbhDUPrZ)

## what we want (overview)
* all the things people have made
* some kind of thing-related report (when you make the thing, you write) **ie. show your work**
* some time-based report (weekly report or something) **ie. weekly update**


## records/data/fields for what we need to get
### show your work
* person name
* person slack ID
* created time
### weekly update
* numbers for reporting
    * consultations - number, and with who (MW can tag on the backend if we want plain text fields)
* 
### to figure out
* where to store all of the pieces of 'things made' so everything can have a link
## mechanics
* slash command to slack modal to airtable
### frequency for time-based update
* weekly for MDFs
* shift based for llufs? weekly based on lluf pod?
## viewing/using documentation
* for staff
    * slack to #ll-fellows-admin for each submission
    * CD/JK/DD review submissions and figuring out:
        * whether their mentor needs to check in with them
        * whether we want to loop MK in as a resource
        * whether we want to get them to talk about at the main table for further documentation or to use on social media
        * etc.
* for the community
    * timeline to use during mdf meeting
    * printing for the wall

## quick ideas and thoughts dd 20230720
### requirements to keep in mind
* returner mdfs have to make at least 5 posts in their lab channels per week, new mdfs once
* show your work
    * new mdfs: Post to the Learning Lab’s #show-your-work Slack channel several times a week, sharing an image and a few sentences that describe what you’re working on that week
    * bok mdfs: Post to #show-your-work at least once per shift, sharing an image and a few sentences that describe what you’re working on that day
### So...
* lab channels are for articles/ideas/musings, AND work in progress?
* the contracts make it sound like show your work is a TIME based update. but i think we wanted weekly updates for that. so what makes it into show your work, and not a lab channel?
* do we want the posts in lab channels to go into airtable? maybe not every post but maybe the returner mdfs get special emoji powers in their lab channels to react and that would send things to the specific lab base?
* weekly update would be great to be in airtable. we should brainstorm questions and the differences in ones for mdfs & llufs
* we have to decide whether to make new lab channels or use existing ones. what are the pros and cons of each?

## things we want: jk, cd, emmy meeting 20230725
* mdf prompts for LLUFs
    * in addition to designLabs
* end of term galleries and showcases
* mdf weekly updates
    * airtable would be awesome
* show-your-work of some kind
    * for mdfs - a few times a week would be amazing
    * but maybe this gets combined with documentation/interview station set ups?
* lluf weekly check-ins
* lluf shift check-ins
    * airtable form
    * what did you finish? what's still in progress?
* lluf project journal
    * hackmd (maybe combined with weekly check-in?)
* regular video interviews with fellows
    * what are you working on
    * what did you learn, etc.
* lab reports from mdf lab leaders
    * compiled from slack
* regular lab posts from all lab members
    * on slack




## documentation conversation 20230803
### llufs
* per shift - simple airtable form. (moonshot to be on next, locally hosted)
    * shift report (maybe also good for MPAs)
* per week - slack modal or airtable form, social media sized post
* per project - airtable form
* per term - each lluf will have a hackMD notebook they are consistently populating (sketchbook) present a refined collection (portfolio)
### mdfs
* weekly update
* everything you make you have to share on slack where appropriate
* the expectation for heavier duty storytelling - twice a year we send 3 page report with embedded media to your department, so we're going to ask you to choose a number of things you've done that you want to unpack
    * for lab leaders they can have more responsibility in that zone
### all
* could create timelines out of updates
* time based updates for fellows, captioning a period of time
* specialized is on camera
* work updates - everything you make
* in certain cases, we'll ask you to do a little more storytelling about what you did

## to do - 
* jk create a sample of everything that she wants mk and dd to hold on to
* dd - 
    * shift report (llufs and MPAs)
    * create a view for central syncing and dani will test it with an MPA log
* cd make hackmd with mdf weekly update questions for dd and mk

to do 
* time based updates
* work updates
* show and tell stuff

specify all the channels and we should listen to all of them
* util-img-2-md
* lab channels - links, references, incremental updates

feature request
* emojis in lab channels would give markdown
