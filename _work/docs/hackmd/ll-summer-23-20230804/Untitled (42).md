* get MPAs to clean and do things this summer and llufs in the fall
* studio/theatre lab - getting mdfs comfortable running things in the space and getting llufs to help as kind of stage crew

## to think about
* storage things
* big changes to rooms or spaces
* decide on total number of storage assets and get people to work on those things

## messy brainstorming notes
* 'i don't know where it goes but i know it goes in this room' space in the storage rooms
* rooms:
    * glass studio: plants, and silver and white
    * music room: can be duplicate of the glass studio or can be more of music studio

## major steps to do
* list out resources
* start to think about where everything goes
    * we want everything you might need in the studio, hour to hour minute to minute basis, to be available in the main studio and classroom
* get as many things in use as possible 
    * fine to loan people things in storage, but great to get all of our cameras etc. set up and recording
* make note of things we need/would like to get


potentially using stores as mental model, ie:
* B&H
* Blick (maybe by the LL kitchen)
* Home Depot
* compucenter/apple store
* etc.
* storage rooms as annexes or warehouses?

## individual to do's
* labeling the blue bins
* continuing to build out the front desk
* find local supplier for pipe
* also need to rebuild the paper capture workflow

## immediate to do's
* create an LL storage plan airtable
    * start by listing all the big things, and then could even go and list the bins
* JK+CC come up with a proposal for MK's feedback/approval
