# LL Admin June/early July tasks for MW to do's
## Enrollment numbers
In [this view of AY22-23 Course Projects](https://airtable.com/app2Q5werGGNgVOiE/tblOpwBFVvFAGlPER/viwUURv1z7tqa4TDp?blocks=hide), you can see we are missing some enrollment numbers. All courses are linked which is awesome, so that just means going back and filling out enrollment numbers to the linked Bok Courses. To do:
* Please fill out enrollment wherever it is missing.
* Pay special attention to when there should be more than 1 course linked to a metaproject (ie. AJ & Sheza - I'm not totally sure but I would image when they have two classses at different times, those show up separately in the HUIT data. so we should have both of their sections with both of their enrollments). 
* The places to look for enrollment are:
    1. [the registrar](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/archive)
    2. [LL client logs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXcLSDnJayEoktI7GNnsDPbSUwtRWz2q) - I was getting Abby's help with this in the fall but we fell off of doing this in the spring. There may be enrollment data here
    3. ask Caroline!?

## Office Hours data gathering
* please add the information we have (name, course, date, etc.) from [fall office hours signups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fgLfrXwB55zF9P89YN-qS5THubOf0cuGSV2UtzGdcQE/edit#gid=0) to the [airtable table of office hours sign ups]

## Email to faculty who we didn't work with, but whose students came to us for support
### details
* review with MK+DD who to reach out to from [this list](https://airtable.com/app2Q5werGGNgVOiE/tblOpwBFVvFAGlPER/viwoiMAAeW85rd65D?blocks=hide)
* determine with MK whether this is for office hours attendance too? or just recordings and consultations?

### normal template

Subject: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning's Learning Lab
Hi _____,

We’re writing because we supported ______ in their creative capstone project this past [fall or spring] semester for _______ and we wanted to see if you’d be interested in consulting with us. 

At the Learning Lab, we collaborate with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. When ___ reached out to us, we were able to help them because we had extra availability, but if you’d like to meet up over zoom, we’d be thrilled to know if we can support more of your students. We often host a workshop (or a series of workshops) launching creative assignments and also host drop-in office hours for multimedia assignments. You can see a little more about what we do here: https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab 

Please let us know! 
All best,

## Exemplary Projects
### details
* work on getting [this gallery view](https://airtable.com/shrFUU1o5YyQeoZsu) to look decent enough to send out :) 
    * work with CC/SC to figure out the best way to host the projects so they are viewable. it might be a google drive link for each thing (but not sure about the soundcloud or spotify ones)
    * following up on waivers for folks who gave us email permission or sent us projects but the waiver field is missing
* show to MK+DD, and when it's ready, add to the template below.
* decide about whether to add AI language to this template
* review with MK+DD who to reach out to from [this list](https://airtable.com/app2Q5werGGNgVOiE/tblOpwBFVvFAGlPER/viwGRsGuqNtEIHYcD?blocks=hide)
* determine with MK+DD who you should reach out and who you might want Christine to reach out (if it was primarily an MDF project)
* when you receive emails back, please add the information to [this airtable](https://airtable.com/app0rG0PwXQX6xiUS/tbl03HTnyTndXVRhK/viwxqmHLu92xVxUuw?blocks=hide) & move the emails into the "exemplary student work" folder in outlook

### template for email to faculty we worked with in Spring 2023, asking for exemplary student projects
Subject: Exemplary student work
Hi _______,

It was fantastic supporting ______ last semester - please let us know if you’d like to meet up about any courses you might want our support on in the future.

Over the next few months, we’re reaching out to courses the Bok Learning Lab supported to begin to put together a gallery of exemplary student work on creative and multimodal projects. Would you be willing to identify 2-3 projects that you really loved, and let us know the students names and emails who made those projects? There's no urgent rush on this at all, but we'd like to reach out to them to see if they’re willing to give us permission to share their projects, and speak with us about some reflections they have about their work. 

Please let us know! 
All best,
Dani
