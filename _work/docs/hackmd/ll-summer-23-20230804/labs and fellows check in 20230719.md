# labs and fellows check in 20230719

questions
- async vs sync
 
next steps
- cd to write expectations of the returner mdfs and also regular/new mdfs
    - mdfs are both coming to the friday meeting and also join a lab. returners will run a synchronous lab time - beginning of the term its about internal learning and then it will become office hours
    - synch lab time at the start of the term will be learning time (so lab leader mdf on site to work on learning and anyone else can join with that)
    - updates and shows, and also project proposals
        - we should decide on one key mechanic. maybe private slack channels and airtable vs. hackMDs
- absolute requirement that mdfs teach the llufs AND test things out with the llufs
    - require each lab do a designLab and lab leader mdf in charge of determining when lab does this, helping to coordinate with staff co-leader?


## to figure out now?
* lab structure
* lluf scheduling re: scheduling designLabs and toolTimes

notes:
* labs are not synchronous. there will be lab times that the mdf co-leader (and ideally the staff co-lead) will be there more in the vein of office hours.
* mk cares most about regular scheduling/recurring appointments so we can schedule toolTimes and designLabs
    * jk's alternative - limiting llufs recurring schedules to no more than 4 at a time. and scheduling designLabs separately
    * mk is fine with 4 people (but maybe would prefer 5) he just wants to know when we can rely on folks being around
    * jk to define in the calendar so dd knows when they are
* part of lluf training should be able to work asynchronously on these learning projects, but they could check in with other llufs
* should be a basic core repeating schedule. then there are no promises additional things that we'll invite folks to. they don't have to say yes and we don't have to send
* we want more structures we stick with for mdfs & llufs. mdfs is largely doc based, project proposals updates etc. llufs will be recurrant studio support basics and things they know how to do without asking for help. if we can structure the pod meetings and have deliverables out of them that would be great
* ILP clarification
    * this year we'll determine these and announce them. people will be doing them at different points. they won't all wrap in the first month. the size should be something an mdf would complete within a month if they were really dedicated. there could be some basic pathways beyond that for next steps, and also steps in the ILP that folks could dive in deeper. good to have a variety of different levels engagement that are ok for ILPs.
