## avLab initial learning project

## additional learning project ideas
### pop-up video booth or podcast booth
* set up one of the rooms to be a stand alone studio
* record an interview or confessional
* edit it and put into a lookbook/reel of what you can do for students
    * include set up time, materials needed, etc. almost like a recipe card

### add a custom music bed
* in logic or gband create a music bed for us to use in workshops or for students to use in their podcast assignments

### intro title sequence
