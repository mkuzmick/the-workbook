# Summer Project: Jessiâ€™s LL Live Event Grammar 

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F05F8U7R04X/screen_shot_2023-07-05_at_3.28.09_pm_1_.jpg?pub_secret=d11fc15e2f)

## At a Glance

This summer Jessi is working on all things #studio to prep for fall ll-studio-lab. This will include prototyping, augmenting, and documenting different moves for live events in the main studio and plugging it into airtable as a resource for future live event planning/dreaming. She will simultaniously experiment with including AI generative tools to increase efficienct and speed of documentation for live events.

## Project Details

### Context

- in the past jessi has worked on theatrelab and run various workshops in the main studio for TDM and other departments
- last year she experimented with integrating new moves into the main studio (e.g. projection)
- MDFs struggle to understand what is possible/what has been done before in the main studio, it would be helpful to have resources on the different moves and grammar in order to promote studuo literacy for the fellows
- connecting the studio research with the 'Summer of AI' project will increase efficiency and speed of documentation for live events



### Deliverables 

- air table master spread of the different 'moves' and 'grammar' to be used in the main studio, which will include:
    - definitions
    - tags
    - free online learning resources
    - HackMD how-to's


### Outcomes and Next Steps

- Will start by learning & documenting the basic components of the main studio and how the system operates, e.g.
    - ATEM/the hub
    - Audio experimentation day 
    - recording, logging segments, quick edits from footage

- Will then switch to identifying some of the key moves that can be made with these components, experimenting with them in the studio and documenting them in airtable.
- While documenting the key moves I will spend a full week experimenting with the generative AI tools and prototyping their integration into the studio moves
- By the end of the summer I will have an air table (spreadsheet? what are the individual tables called?) that identifies, gives examples of, and invites design challenges around key moves that have and could be done in the main studio for live events.
