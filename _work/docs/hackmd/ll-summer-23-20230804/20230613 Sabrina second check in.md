# 20230613 Sabrina second check in

## setups for recordings
* small studio
* main table
* corner shot

## slides
* Sabrina made a doc with specific slides that need to change

## where to begin?
* resources online that could explain basic concepts like:
    * what is a neural network (Neural Network Basics - on the resources page that Sabrina added to the google drive folder)
    * does it make sense to recreate this?
    * Sabrina could curate 3 videos that kick off the module
* starting with generative AI and machine learning
    * supervised versus unsupervised learning
    * generative AI is unsupervised learning
    * Sabrina excited about images and language as well
    * boundaries
    * minimizing the "loss" (gap between true representation and rep'n we are approximating)
    * representation
    * neural networks and non-linearity allows us to solve more complex problems we don't have a simple equation for
    * sub-symbolic computation
