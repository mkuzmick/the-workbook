# notes

## first question 

* to khurana, as a general framing question: 
     * what values do you hope to keep at the forefront of a Harvard education as we enter this new era?
     
* answer: 
    * khurana says he's had access for awhile, and he's been getting lots of responses. 
        * some are excited 
        * some are indifferent 
            "a colleague said that chatgpt was like a caluclator for words."
        * some think it's dystopian 
        
    * khurana says he wants to stick with the values of: 
        * our mission as a college
            * "The mission of Harvard College is to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society. We do this through our commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education."
        * "transformation"
        * view students as individual minds, not machinery 
        * considered thought 
    
    
    * but that he thinks we need to have conversations 
        **
## second question 
  

* to malen: 
     * you've been in [the news](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/6/21/cs50-artificial-intelligence/), how are you approaching ai?
     
     malen is positive. he doesn't think this is replacement of teachers, but the ultimate compliment, freeing up TFs to focus on more complex tasks and build relationships. 
     
     obviously, as a tech teacher, it's very easy to integrate. 
     
     in the fall: 
     
     wanting a tutor for questions, helping with error codes 
     
     in two years: 
     
     ai evaluation of student work. 
     
     ai examination (like an oral discussion)
     
     
     all to reallocate our most precious resources, humans, to human tasks. 
    
    
    
    
  
## third question    
    
   
        
* to latanya: 
     * you've been
     
how should we view ai as a way to free up humans to tasks that are more human based. 
      
      
she says we're in the third industrial revolution. we've been here before, with similar tools. she noted, for instance, that this conversation was happening on zoom. 


however, she teaches classes about the underbelly-- where it goes wrong. 

for example: most of the content will be created by bots, creating an echo chamber. 


because chatgpt learned in the wilds of the internet, it's biased and hallucinates all the time. 



## fourth question 

khurana interjects: 

how do you frame the technology to your studnets?

she says the students are really proficient at idenitfying the good and bad (dont be starry eyes, but also dont be afraid) 

her students did a lot of experiments 
    (harvard admissions essays)
    it was difficult to distinguish certain kinds of content. the more formal the content, the easier it was to detect. 
    
but when it comes to more conversational chatting, it was almost impossible, and often to ai won out 


her student asked ot write her a paper by her. they made citations that dont even exist. 


## fifth question 

eric: he teaches election fraud, etc. 

he didn't ban, and even had a student with chatgpt open in class, to occasionally refer to. 


chatgpt has an inability to express creedence, or doubt. it is very confident with panache. very few qualifiers when expressing opinions. 


doesn't want to put students in situations of unfair tempation. 

so he ran his assignments through it, in order to help. 


as to some people asking to return to paper and pen, as someone who's dyslexic, he wouldn't have been able to graduate. 




## sixth 

khurana interjects, saying he has students come in and give him tutorials. 


he says LLM's focus on high probability choices. and khurana pointed out that breakthroughs come through low probabilty choices-- through individual choices. from hallucinations of our own, that we can then examine. 

it doesn't generate new knwoledge. 


but eric said, students arent expected to make breakthroughs and new knowledge-- so that doesn't prevent students from using iot to demonstarte subject competancy. 


## 7 

malen says you can bake into the algorithm and epsolon principle, which asks it to "explore" 5% of the time, and "exploit" the rest when using a data set 


khurana says  "maybe there will be a critical ai studies"

how to discern or defend, analyze ai work 


eric: is it just trained on reddit? and not twitter?

latanya: it seems to be able to mimick twitter

malen: I believe so, with a cap at 2021 




# 8 

cheating!

malen says we should attack the external factors that bring students to cheating. 

that this isnt going to be the beginning or end of cheating. 


latanya seconds this, by bringing up calculators and grammar checker.s 

she says it will be fine this is how students have first drafts and brainstoirm. 


just the next evolutions. 



debate ensues on how equatable chatgpt is to past innovations. 


how do we scaffold students into trying new things and working up to higher levels of work? 





again, allll goes back to how we think about education. 


is this for profit? what is learning? what is the purpose?
