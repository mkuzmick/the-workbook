# SCRB111-Faculty Consultation-writing

## Writing Task Description and Notes

### Context
We want to write back to Jessica about the assignment + upcoming workshop.

[consultation notes from late August](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XrDvHtngl161iI4awNPK3TBJL87k-NAVVmmqJGr_GAc/edit#heading=h.vkzsp9mku64y)

### Deliverables
an email for jessica (with mk, jk, and er CCed) - with language around a final assignment that is more of a live presentation that gets recorded with a couple of follow up question. if so, here are some paragraphs that you can use in the syllabus or instructions of assignment. (can offer to schedule a rehearsal too)
* confirm that she's not requiring a script anymore
* see if tf would want to come to consultations + rehearsal (who on our team is doing consultations)
* the goal is to internalize the concepts, not to get wedded to the words of a script


### other notes
* hand TF a chunk of time to schedule the final filmings - could be anywhere with an overhead and a microphone

## Text Drafting

bullets for writing back to Jessica
- confirm that there is no script requirement this year and that the final is now a recording of a live-performance (still becomes a video, but the student only needs to think about the live performance and the visuals for the overhead camera)
- confirm that TF will be there to ask follow-up Qs
- confirm that final videos can be overhead only
- mention ideas for getting feedback from ChatGPT along the way (including sending transcript of rehearsals with prompts for feedback)
- 

Hi Jessica,

we just wanted to write back with some quick bullets in response to our earlier conversation. We're sorry to be late--we've had an array of folks knocked out of commission by covid and it has slowed us down. But we'll all be back in time for your workshop next week and we just wanted to confirm a few quick things about the final assignment to make sure we are all on the same page before the workshop:

1. First, we discussed the idea of requiring students to do the final assignment as a presentation with pre-prepared visuals this year, but without a pre-prepared memorized script. The rationale for this not just being that memorizing-a-script isn't exactly the same as knowing the content, but that this year ChatGPT is going to be able to help them write scripts.
2. Second (relatedly) we discussed the idea of allowing the students to get feedback from ChatGPT about their various rehearsals of the final presentation. (Again, if the goal is for them to understand and internalize the concepts--and the oral presentation proves that this is the case--why NOT get help from ChatGPT as you do this?)
3. If there is no requirement for a written script in advance, it may make sense to have some other scaffolded steps along the process, these could be any of the following:
    - a project proposal by a certain date
    - an on-camera explanation of a single visual element from your project in our studio in less than 1-minute by a certain date (these could then be discussed in class or shared on Canvas for discussion and feedback)
    - a consultation with LL staff &/or the TF about a storyboard for the presentation
    - a recorded rehearsal completed by a certain date
4. We also discussed the possibility of having the TF for the course be present during the final recording sessions (these could be half an hour each, allowing for 1 or 2 run-throughs and then some follow-up questions from the TF). If this works, we would work with the TF to schedule 2-3 large blocks of time that work for them, and then the TF could get students to sign up for 30 minute slots.

Again, our apologies for the delay in getting this all to you in written form. Please let us know your thoughts and we look forward to seeing you next week for the workshop!

All best,
Marlon and Dani
