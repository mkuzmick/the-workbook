# gened1001 20231017

## resources
* rubrics
* help requests
* office hours
* consultations with students
* hackathons

## final gallery of student projects
* elitza excited to help with this
* giovanni wants to check in with elitza to see where things are with this

## notes
* teaching team just starting to think about final project
* intentional choices about formal decisions
    * why did you make that choice
    * and why is this medium what you needed 
    * marginal comments come from understanding the pieces of the "machine" and the students' reflection on their process
* critical mass of students - we could put together a workshop
    * but if smaller group, elitza can do consultations
    * also could connect the course to lamont
* generative AI art for the final project?
    * show and tell in different tools
    * GB inclined to let them use it
* meeting for the grading element
    * we could help come up with words to say back to students
* generative ai - images specifically
    * if students plan to use ai, the expectation will be more/more complex than traditional means
    * need to tell the students in advance (maybe on the assignment page/rubric)

## things we for sure want to follow up on
* generative AI workshop
* meeting for grading element
* final gallery project

## dates to schedule
* nov 9: feedback session with TFs
