# TDM 98 Junior Tutorial

In TDM 98 Junior Tutorial, students were introduced to the innovative world of AI and generative AI. They had the opportunity to code their own bots and create an improvised drama within a dedicated experimental Slack channel. This activity not only taught them about AI design and engineering but also provided a unique perspective on how skills from non-coding disciplines can be applicable in cutting-edge technological fields. The hands-on experience with AI in this tutorial led to unexpected learning outcomes and creative discoveries.
