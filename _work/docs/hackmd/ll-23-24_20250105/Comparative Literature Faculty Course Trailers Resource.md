# Comparative Literature Faculty Course Trailers


## Pre-interview prep:

Brainstorm a concise idea for each of the following points:
1. what your class is about
2. why students should be interested in or excited about the class (what makes it unusual or important?)
3.  what skills or concepts students will gain from the class.

Keep in mind the audience for your course. 
* Is it designed for undergraduate or graduate students? 
* Concentrators or students from a range of disciplines? 
* Direct your ideas primarily to this target audience.

*Note: do not write a script. The interview should be casual and conversational.*

## During the interview:

You will be asked to speak for no more than 3 minutes about your spring 2024 class. The interview team might ask follow-up questions.

Following discussion about the spring course, you will have a chance to speak about the discipline of Comparative Literature and your research. This material will be used to make other videos for the CL website.

## General video interview tips:
1. Aim for short, pithy sentences.
2. Remember that any questions the production team asks will be edited out of the videos. If someone from the interview team asks a question, respond in a way that rephrases the subject at hand.
