# Music207 Audio Workshop

| Split into 2 groups | 20-25 Minutes Each |
|----|---|
| Group 1 | Take field recorders out, record a short interview in 2 different locations. Try then, for each location, to capture 3 significant sound elements make that space identifiable |
| Group 2 | Set up 2 recording spaces. Record a short voiceover with each microphone, within that space(announce which mic you're using at the beginning of each recording to reference later) |
| Break | | 
| Full Group | Pull your media into Adobe Audition and build a timeline with a mix of recorded and found audio sources |

## References

Microphones are classified by two different categories, the [pickup patterns](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/6-microphone-pickup-patterns-every-filmmaker-should-know/) and [sensitivity](https://headlinermagazine.net/dynamic-vs-condenser-mics-recording-vocals.html)

Regardless of the mic you're using, it's quality is always directly related to the distance the mic is to it's subject. Every mic has an appropriate recording distance for what you're capturing, its important to test out what that distance is. 

### Sensitivity

![](https://headlinermagazine.net/assets/img/assets/img/2022/dynamic_condenser_mic_elements_difference.jpg)

#### Condenser Mics

Condenser mics are considerably more sensitive, they are able to pick up sound at a greater distance, and with a larger dynamic range. These are often used for recording in the field, where you're better off capturing more, so that you can refine what it sounds like later. 

#### Dynamic Mics

Dynamic mics are much less sensitive than condensers, however this can be a huge help. In circumstances where you have no control over what's happening around you, they'll allow you to still pick up a quality signal, provided you speak quite close to the microphone. 

These are also almost a requirement if you're also amplifying the subject's voice/instrument, as the low sensitivity doesn't pick up the sound of the PA, which would turn it to feedback. 


### Microphone Pick up Patterns

#### Omnidirectional

Picks up in all directions, often sacrifices coverage for clarity.

#### Cardioid 

Picks up a wide globe in front of the mic, very good for recording in an open room, when you'd like to capture a clear recording, but also a sense of space. Very good for occasions where you have uncontrolled sound behind the mic(this is very frequently HVAC systems, or windows)

#### Hypercardioid
Records in a very focussed line, protruding from the center of the mic, though has acute pick up behind and immediately beside the microphone as well. Very good for occasions where you might not want to have the mic in the shot.

#### Polar

Records roughly equally on either side of the microphone in large, arcing globes. Tends to have a "full" sound, that fills out the space it's recording in.
