**Workshop Plan for Wednesday's Video Game Workshop**

**Orientation Station (Marlon)** The workshop kicks off at the Orientation Station, where Marlon, along with potential team members, will guide students through the intricate landscape of video game production. Drawing from Unity documents among other resources, this station aims to demystify the diverse career paths within game design and development, categorizing them into coding and art disciplines, among other subdivisions. The session will cover the entire production cycle, from market research to marketing, highlighting the game engine's pivotal role. A notable activity involves collaboratively crafting a dynamic map with students to visualize the video game production process. Introducing Jesse Schell's Tetrad— aesthetics, mechanics, story, and technology—this section will set the conceptual framework for the workshop, encouraging students to pinpoint where their interests or favorite games intersect with the industry's landscape.

**Mechanics Station** The Mechanics Station delves into the core game mechanics—randomization, resource management, scarcity, reward systems, and more. It will challenge students to dissect and discuss these mechanics within the context of their course analyses. The station offers practical Unity exercises to adjust mechanic properties, like jump velocity or in-game sound effects, potentially integrating a real-time soundboard for interactive learning.

**Aesthetics Station (Chris B)** Chris B takes the helm at the Aesthetics Station, emphasizing the critical role of 3D artistry in contemporary video game production. Through hands-on learning in Blender, students will craft simple scenes, subsequently transforming them via stable diffusion into complex levels—mirroring real-world level design. This station also contemplates offering substations for students with prior Blender experience or those drawn to other art forms, like sound design, allowing for exploration of game audio elements.

**Story Station** With the course's narrative focus in mind, the Story Station will engage students in the art of storytelling within video games. Past activities have included using art supplies and cards to design branching storylines or reimagining linear narratives with multiple outcomes. This station may also explore dialogue production, with a view toward leveraging AI for enhancing narrative depth, alongside activities centered on character development and backstory creation.

**Technology Station (Siriana)** Siriana's domain, the Technology Station, concentrates on the game's user interface system, exploring the evolution of game controllers and display technology. Highlighting the integration of students' earlier creations into Unity, this station aims to demonstrate the tangible outcomes of their workshop efforts. An exciting prospect mentioned by Marlon involves students possibly stepping into the small studio to craft brief oral video essays on their course projects, showcasing the game engine not just as a development tool but also as a medium for academic presentation.
