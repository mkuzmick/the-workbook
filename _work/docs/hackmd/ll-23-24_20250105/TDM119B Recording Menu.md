# TDM119B Recording Menu

We're thrilled to welcome TDM119B students back to the Learning Lab! 

* On the 16th, you'll rehearse your monologues in our space. 
* We'll send you back the rehearsal recordings on the 17 or 18th for you to review before your final recording.
* You'll come back to record on the 19th!
    * **Please schedule time with [this calendly link](https://calendly.com/boklearninglab/french11-student-filming-clone) and include the one shot type you would like for your monologue!**
    * If the 19th doesn't work for you, please email us at learninglab@fas.harvard.edu to schedule a different time.


## shot types to choose from


### FS: Full Shot

A shot that contains the subject's entire body. Sometimes used interchangeably with long shot, but if you DO want to make a distinction, the full shot would be tighter--just the full body, while the long shot could sometimes refer to a slightly longer/wider shot that this. Our small studio can barely manage this, and in order to arrive at a useful final product you will want to replace the background.
