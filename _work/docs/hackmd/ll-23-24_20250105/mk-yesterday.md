# mk-yesterday

## plan

Work mainly in the control room and office. Goal is to get the system working and to prep for the variety of reports and pitches we'll need to do in the coming month.

Render more media visible. Constantly. Stories of the week, day, hour, minute.

Have timeline js pointing at key moment-base elements.

Need project cards ASAP.
