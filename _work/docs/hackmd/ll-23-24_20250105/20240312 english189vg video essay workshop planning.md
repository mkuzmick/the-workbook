## messy notes

- date: March 20, 4:30-5:45pm
- video essay workshop
- would be great to get the prompt
- not the game-building workshop, though even for those building games they may want to think about how to present the game, and we'll cover things relevant to that at this workshop
- elements
    - look at a couple of samples and analyze
        - print out some stills and strips
        - when do we see the speaker and when not? what is the value of this?
        - when does the thesis show up?
        - taking advantage of the medium (split screens, tiles, highlighting, etc etc.)
        - when do we see footage of the game
    - storyboarding/argument
        - could use paper
        - allude to slide-pres software (if we'll encounter it later)
    - game capture
        - from device
        - from internet
    - video editing/clipping
        - the process side (saving samples)
        - creating short clips and gifs
        - (inserting in )
    - argument structure/content?
    - mechanic analysis
    - recording your voice-over 
    - editing 
        - slide pres
        - web-based
        - video editor


## to do
* buy a few video game capture devices and test out (mk)
* make a hackMD that is this process (the elements above) - collaborative, but could be partially influenced by what we come up with at the workshop
    * and then depending on number of people, we decide whether to just walk through the doc OR run it with stations
* siriana find example video essays she likes
    * favorite ones - we'll print stills and strips
    * siriana will make a few
* open prompt for mdfs, which could then be added to the async doc:
    * micro video essay examples
    * own proofs of concepts of little moves you can perform in a video essay 
* everyone share assets as they go


## prompts from [Canvas](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/129335)

### from syllabus re: final presentation:
In the last week of the semester, you’ll give a presentation (of roughly 5-10 minutes) making a case for any game you like – that  isn’t   featured on the syllabus – as a work of innovative storytelling. You will prepare 5 slides to help your analysis: if you would prefer to submit an essay instead, that’s absolutely fine.   You   might   also   choose   the   multi-modal   option:   a   Vox   video  essay,   or   Twitch   stream.   The   Learning   Lab   at   the   Bok   Center   will   provide examples

### from syllabus re: paper 2, which is due march 18: 
The second paper (5 pages) will consider aspects of design across at least two games: you might, for instance, discuss contrasting styles of music.
### guidelines for creative options doc for paper 2
And here is [some guidance for the second assessment](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/129335/files/19482506?wrap=1 "guidelines for creative option.docx"), should you choose the creative option.

> The creative option (for Assessment 2)  
> All projects must still "consider aspects of design across   at least two games" and must come with a short explanation. You will need to get approval on your project from your TF, at least two weeks before the due date. For those of you who want to pursue this option but are feeling a little stuck, here are some prompts:
> * Results and analysis of a survey given out to your friends about aspects of the games 
> * A zine  
> * A video essay discussing game music  
> * An op-ed: a more journalistic piece, arguing the value (or lack of value) of a  particular genre.  
> * Coding something that merges aspects of the two existing games  
> * Storyboarding a new game: matching story beats to a game mechanic  
> * If you want to go further in creating your own game, there are several code-free  options (Twine, Bitsy; Unity Engine’s code-free kit can build simple 2D RPGs in less than an hour – https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg – and the Learning Lab can advise further).
