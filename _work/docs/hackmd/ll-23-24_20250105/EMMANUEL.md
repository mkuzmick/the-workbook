# EMMANUEL Project Report Template

## Project Description

### Project/Tool Overview
**Project Name:** Real-Time Lecture Interaction Tool  
**Associated Harvard Course:** N/A

**Summary:**  
This tool is designed to transform traditional lecture delivery through real-time interactive quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Leveraging the OpenAI API, it enables lecturers to pose questions during lectures and receive immediate responses, facilitating a more dynamic and engaging learning environment.

**Technology Stack:** OpenAI API, potentially integrating ReactJS for frontend development to create an intuitive user interface and Python for backend logic to process and analyze student responses.

### Learning Objectives and Benefits
**Objectives:**  
- Increase student engagement during lectures through real-time interaction.
- Provide lecturers with immediate feedback on student comprehension, allowing for adaptive teaching strategies.

**Benefits:**  
By enabling an interactive lecture experience, students are more likely to remain engaged and retain information. Lecturers can tailor their presentations to the needs of the class, enhancing the effectiveness of their teaching and potentially leading to improved learning outcomes.

## Bi-Weekly Update
**Date:** 20240220

### Interesting Developments
Emmanuel's project is in the early stages, focusing on developing a tool that enhances lecture interactivity in real-time. 

### Resource Requests
Technical support for integrating APIs, such as accessing transcripts via Panopto and distributing quizzes to students, is a current need.

He also requests more collaboration and support, as he can only work "an hour at a time"

### Best Practices & Learnings
His requests demonstrate a need for more collaboration, support, and benchmarking, as well as making it more clear that GAICAs can reach out over slack. 

## Collaboration and Feedback

### Staff Collaboration
Limited so far, with Emmanuel expressing a need for greater collaboration with others working on similar projects to overcome technical hurdles and share insights.

### Feedback Implementation
Feedback has not yet been a focus, given the project's early stage, but Emmanuel is open to incorporating ideas and suggestions from peers and potential collaborators.

## Future Directions

### Next Steps
* Emmanuel wants to collaborate with Suvin, and build a single functionality for Suvin's larger framwork
* This will require a hackathon.
