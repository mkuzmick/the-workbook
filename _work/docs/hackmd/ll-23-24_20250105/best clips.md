[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-wZeU4fMoZGhZwFh9Spw2ag_xp6rA0IX/view?usp=drive_link): The question that this music class is sort of asking is, "can machines understand musical form?" And I think that's a really interesting question, and I think it is a very interesting problem to solve. And when I think about it sort of in the context of the Learning Lab, I think it's a really, I mean, I think this is a great place for people to experiment with questions like that. And I certainly think that like sort of delving into the, into this AI space, the generative AI space, I think really placing an emphasis on you know, "how can we how can we build things that don't replace, but instead sort of lift up others in a way that is useful and productive and saves people time? To do the jobs that they already do?" I think that and not just for my project, but for, you know, any project.

GAICA: **Indra**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTP8ejle8NXwTb0HPB0BI3LBcMqGSjjw/view?usp=drive_link): Because I think it's something that has only recently been introduced. It's something that, likem looks like threat to education or for certain jobs. And I am a firm belief-- I'm a firm believer that I think integrating AI with certain jobs can-- what you say--  help us lift up society and help us advance faster.

And I think sort of like the work that we're doing here, you know, integrating with classes such as comparative literature, is the perfect way to show everybody that we don't really need to see it as a threat, but rather like something that elevates us to a different level that perhaps we couldn't achieve without these kind of technologies.

[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMtAn_oZp-KzZASDu1_J29Ajsrz3miYN/view?usp=drive_link): [end of clip] ...I don't I don't know if that's what the end project will look like, but I think it's a step in the right direction of that same core question, which is: "education, all this tech; [together] what does it look like?""

GAICA: **Gonzalo**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ibxUCoU1AjxR8b8KYf4sdd3w3p1MUKRk/view?usp=drive_link): For me, this this job feels like an ideal job that I didn't have on campus because personally, I love building stuff. I love coding, just, I don't know, it's my way of of getting creative, and having fun. And I always learn new things. We all do that. But when you have a lot of classes and responsibilities, it's hard to find a time to actually work on your hobbies and stuff like this in your free time. And this job gives me an opportunity to focus that time. And, you know, have that moment where I can code and be creative and learn new things. You know, also, I think that we've got we've reached a point, in history where we have a lot of technology, readily available to do anything. We have all the puzzle pieces, and now, people like us need to think about how to put them together to build something cool and something new.

GAICA: **Indra**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1TDal2Q05RqfhHKCf00IMoO5H3Dual4/view?usp=drive_link): I started coding, in college, so it's very exciting to have more of a, yeah, "practice" experience that also can benefit people, because I feel like sometimes in classes it's very theoretical-- which is really cool too-- but I think, coding is only complete when you can do both. And it's very rewarding to see, to be working on a project that benefits you and benefits everybody. And it's also really fun. And I think also like hearing from everyone, everybody's so excited to be working on this projects.

[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qWOrhL-hBgIExjOzGDe2CNBd8YXcJN2/view?usp=drive_link):
I think the way I see development going in, what I'm most interested in is user interaction. So if this is meant to be given to students, and the idea is that I, as a comparative literature student, will use this. My biggest concern is like, am I restricting the creativity of the individual in the code that I create?

[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1psoY72_c5aV9XStpGkFhUZKXl3-pjNaR/view?usp=drive_link): I'm super excited about the potential of using AI to solve medical problems. And I saw that-- or I feel like -- working as a GAICA on like, these smaller projects is a way to, I don't know, get engaged with coding and AI in a way that is outside of the classroom... Like, it's like creating your own, like baby.
