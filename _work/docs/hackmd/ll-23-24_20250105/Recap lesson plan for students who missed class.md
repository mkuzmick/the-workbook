            prompt used: "reconstructing a lesson for a student"
      
## description
Sometimes students will reach out to the instructor to ask what they missed in class. Instructors can use AI tools like chatGPT to produce thicker descriptions of what happened during class by submitting lesson plan notes and any detail about the types of questions, comments, and topics that came up during that class session. A tool like chatGPT can produce an initial draft of the type of message an instructor might like to share with a student, though it's likely that some editing will be required, particularly if chatGPT is interpreting your handwritten notes (which GPT 4 can do).

## activity one
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

4. Hit Shift + Enter to type your request. 
    * For this activity, ask to create a structured document outlining what occured in a class, based on class notes and other details.,  
        * If you only hit Enter or Return, this will automatically submit your prompt. 
        * You can also add three ticks (''') to indicate a paragraph break if you prefer.

3. Copy and paste your lesson plan notes and any notes you've written describing what actually happened during class.

## activity two 
1. Prepare your handwritten notes
    * Take a clear photograph or scan of the notes you want turned into a resource.

2. Log into a chatGPT account with chatGPT 4 enabled
    * This is needed for image analysis as of October 2023, as the Harvard AI Sandbox does not yet have this functionality.
3. Ask for a transcription of your handwritten notes. 
    * To get a clear transcription, add as many details as possible, such as content, structure, ink colors, or other compositional notes.

4. Upload a photo of your handwritten notes.

5. Once you have a transcription, check for errors. You can prompt chatGPT to fix these errors, or later change them yourself. 
6. Now, ask chatGPT to turn these transcribed notes into a resource.
    * For this activity, ask to create a structured document outlining what occured in a class, based on class notes and other details.

## transcript of activity one example:
* USER: 
    * I would like to create a thick description of what happened during class. I will be giving you lesson plan notes and any details about the types of questions, comments, and topics that came up during that class session. Please use these materials to create a structured document outlining what happened in class for students who were unable to attend. 

        9:00 - 9:15
        * Remind students that the video essay assignment is due next Thursday by 11:59 pm
        * Questions about submission?
            * NOTE: There ended up being a lot of questions about how to export and upload the papers to our class's shared Google drive folder, including how long it would take to upload the video
        
        9:15 - 9:45
        * Group work
            * In pairs, students will try to develop a working definition of American exceptionalism
            * Use either Frederick Douglass’s “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July”(1852) or Sui Sin Far’s “In the Land of the Free” (1912)
                * NOTE: We ended up spending a significant amount of time discussing the Chinese Exclusion Act. Students were also interested in Sui Sin Far's Cantonese pen name (a name different from her birth name, Edith Maud Eaton) and what it might have meant for her to publish with that name in this historical context.
            * Try to come up with a key term or short phrase that would describe the concept of American exceptionalism - we’ll write these up on the board

        9:45 - 10:15
        * We write up our key term/phrases associated with American exceptionalism on the board
        * Which text you used to develop your definition?
            * NOTE: Well over half of the class chose Douglass - probably around 60 percent
        * Let’s map out the relationships between these two texts in terms of how they articulate American exceptionalism
            * What are the points of convergence
            * And divergence
                * NOTE: Students really focused here on the idea that both texts are holding out for the possibility of an ideal "America", even as their texts are deeply critical of the dominant social order.

    * Class Summary:

        The class began at 9:00 am with a reminder about the upcoming video essay assignment due next Thursday by 11:59 pm. There were numerous questions from students about the submission process, particularly concerning how to export and upload their papers to the shared Google Drive folder for the class. Students were also curious about the time it would take to upload their videos.

        From 9:15 to 9:45 am, students engaged in group work where they were tasked with developing a working definition of American exceptionalism. They were instructed to use either Frederick Douglass’s “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July”(1852) or Sui Sin Far’s “In the Land of the Free” (1912) as a reference. Notably, a significant portion of the discussion revolved around the Chinese Exclusion Act. Students also expressed interest in Sui Sin Far's choice of a Cantonese pen name, different from her birth name, Edith Maud Eaton, and its implications in the historical context of her publishing work. The aim of this exercise was to come up with a key term or short phrase that would describe the concept of American exceptionalism.

        From 9:45 to 10:15 am, the class worked on writing up their key terms or phrases associated with American exceptionalism on the board. It was noted that a majority of the class, approximately 60 percent, chose to use Douglass's text as the basis for their definitions. The class then attempted to map out the relationships between the two texts in terms of how they articulate American exceptionalism, focusing on points of convergence and divergence. A key observation from this discussion was that students were drawn to the idea that both texts, despite their critical view of the dominant social order, held out for the possibility of an ideal "America".
