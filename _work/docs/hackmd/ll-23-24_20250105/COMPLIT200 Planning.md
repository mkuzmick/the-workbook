# COMPLIT200 Planning
[20240326 consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2tFJxYCgGfbGib-e9dGXRevvFh8ViMz7ME1wK9G2tQ/edit#heading=h.4q6osyl4hk5v)

## notes
mk's 3 session pitches
- world to image; image to world (combo of block printing, drawing, stained glass, and controlnet)
- recursion (like the emr opposite of opposite business expanded)
- bot ensembles; coding the future of writing/academic labor
    

pitch work time on the 22nd?

### to dos
* haul out block printing supplies
* mw: get stable diffusion colab working for monday

### support staff: 

* GAICAs: 
    * Indra (April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29)
    * Josefina (April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29)
    * Gonzalo (April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29)
* LLUFs:
    * Ben
    * Talulah
* MDFs: 
    * Kevin (April 8, 15, 22, 29)
    * Lara (April 1, 15)


## to do
* come up with a 15-20 minute spiel and activity
* a bunch of different ways of doing physical things that criss cross the physical and digital world
    * block print
    * stretch goal: stained glass


## email from JS
**GROUP 1: a “traditional” AI folk tale collection (file under "fake originals")** 

Helen, Jack, Coby, Ivan, Maddy, Jennifer, Alina, Felix, Ayana

**GROUP 2: a collection of AI-folk tales illustrative of the fundamental Munari/Rodari principles (possibly built around a single tale told and retold)** 

Phoebe, Sean, Wendy, Jaemark, Dhruv, Raphi, Khan

So 16 in all; the coding proficient students on this list are Helen, Jack, Jaemark, and Khan.


## text for gazette
**Course description:** the course is experimental in character and combines the study of literary theory and history, literary works such as folktales and children's stories, and computer-assisted creation employing both textual and visual generative AI tools. By the end of the semester, the class will result in the creation of a carefully crafted and edited volume of illustrated AI folktales. Its central aim is to explore the history of structural, combinatory, and generative thinking about storytelling from Vladimir Propp's _Morphology of the Folk Tale_ to chatGPT in a manner that combines theory, history, and practice. A key pedagogical objective is to promote the development of critical skills with regard to creative uses of generative AI tools of various kinds.


Students in COMPLIT 200 will be coming in to the Learning Lab for a series of workshops where they’ll make use of our resources and use an array of AI tools for their collaborative final project (a book of illustrated AI folktales). The workshops will cover image generation, coding slackbots that funciton as an editorial staff, and various recursive moves that allow the AI to respond to it's own output as input.


## notes


- recursion
- physical and digital worlds (and getting from one to the other)
- bot ensembles and the editing/
- or images?
- or constraints?


## plan for April 1

and other days.

### basics

- if icebreaker, mainly to give them a sense of what the studio does, what the tools are.
- introduce them to an array of tools (quickly)
    - ai tools
    - media tools
    - art tools
    - moves
        - constraints
        - recursion and ensembles
        - physical and digital media, human and artificial intelligence, analog and digital capture
- have two working stations set up for them
    - tables
    - overheads being captured
    - computers
        - with stable diffusion
        - with playgrounds
        - with colabs
        - with adobe
    - mics for transcriptions
    - cards and markers
    - whiteboards
    - 
- mainly 
    1. help them work and plan on day 1; 
    2. do production on day 2
    3. offer additional worktime or hackathon for each of the 3 groups
- set design
    - print lots of the gaica's work
    - emr images up
- resources
    - list of contacts, names, tools
    - timeline/dates
    - 

### rationales and stories

- the mental model for this one should be making space; and that's the way to report it. So less emphasis on content delivery, more on design studio / Q's studio.
- and the lluf/gaicas going a step ahead to then becomes guides
