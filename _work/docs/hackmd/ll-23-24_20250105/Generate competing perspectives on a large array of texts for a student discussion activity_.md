            prompt used: "Request AI to create competing visual academic perspectives on a text segment and organize student groups for critique."
            
## description
GAI: Educators can use an AI tool like ChatGPT to generate competing academic perspectives on an array of small segments of text from the day's reading. This approach can be particularly useful in courses that require critical analysis and discussion, such as literature, history, or social sciences.

For instance, an educator might input a series of text excerpts into the AI tool, asking it to generate two different interpretations for each excerpt. These interpretations could represent different theoretical perspectives, methodological approaches, or historical contexts, depending on the goals of the course.

The AI-generated perspectives can then be used as a starting point for student discussion. Students can be divided into small groups and assigned a set of AI-generated interpretations to critique. They can discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each interpretation, consider alternative perspectives, and work together to arrive at a more sophisticated position.

This exercise can help students develop critical thinking and collaborative learning skills. They can learn to evaluate different perspectives, articulate their own viewpoints, and engage in constructive debate with their peers. It can also expose them to a range of academic perspectives, helping them understand the complexity and diversity of scholarly discourse.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for stimulating discussion, it should not replace human interpretation and analysis. The AI-generated perspectives should be seen as a tool for sparking discussion, not as definitive interpretations. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other teaching methods and strategies, ensuring that students are also exposed to human perspectives and critical approaches.


## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
