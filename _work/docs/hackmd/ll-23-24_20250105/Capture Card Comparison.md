Very little latency, quality is fine, connects fast

## Blue Rectangle

Slightly more latency, but still not a problem, connects fast and video is high quality.

## Blue and Red Square

Latency is very slight, USBC connection is convenient, quality is file once again.

## Black and Red Oval

Latency is once again not a problem, USBC connection is good and the quality is nice, it also lights up which is pretty cool.

## Elgato

Obviously the best in terms of latency, however the quality is more distinguishable than one might assume. It doesn't light up all cool, but it works the best.

**Video Filename**: elgato.mov

## Rankings

1. **Elgato**: USB-C connetion is helpful, the quality is slightly better, and the latency is slightly better too
2. **Black and Red Oval**: It lights up, USB-C connection is useful, and the quality and latency are both good.
3. **Blue and Red Square**: USB-C is once again useful, quality is fine and latency is fine
4. **Blue Rectangle**: It's really a tie with the black rectangle, but this one feels sturdier and more solid
5. **Black Rectangle**: Perfectly fine, quality is passable, and latency is fine.

Overall, the Elgato is the best, but not by a large margin, and with price factored in it would not be number 1. All the capture devices work perfectly well, and the quality on the ranks 2-5 is basically indistinuishable if you are not comparing them side by side.
