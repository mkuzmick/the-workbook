            prompt used: "Analyze large and publicly available datasets."
            
## description
Students can use AI tools to analyze large, publicly available datasets as a way to develop a preliminary understanding of a complex dataset. AI tools like the advanced data analysis capability of GPT 4 can parse datasets and identify patterns, trends, etc. In addition to performing analyses, AI tools can also help students visualize the data.

## activity
1. For this activity, we're going to use OpenAI's GPT 4 advanced data analysis extension (rather than the HUIT Sandbox, since it doesn't currently have this capability).
2. Using the advanced data analysis extension in GPT 4, upload a large dataset of your choosing
3. ask chatGPT to analyze the data for you
4. ask chatGPT what this study is attempting to measure
5. ask chatGPT a follow-up question based on the results you're getting.
