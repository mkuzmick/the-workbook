# Workshop Report: Layering, Compositing, and the Video Essay for GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema


## Introduction:
For the course GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema, taught by Professor Alexander Zahlten, we curated an enlightening workshop to explore layering, compositing, and the art of the video essay. This workshop sought to elucidate the nuanced relationship between form and content in video essays, especially in the context of analyzing anime. The primary goal was to familiarize students with technical components while also inspiring profound reflection on potential subjects of their video essays.

## Workshop Stations:

### Visual Arguments
At this station, students from GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema utilized low-tech tools to craft visual arguments. They worked with layers of printed film stills combined with art supplies. This hands-on activity was designed to cultivate a foundational visual grammar, vital for analyzing and interpreting films in video essays. By creating quick "paper prototypes" prior to engaging with digital tools, students could effectively conceptualize their visual arguments without the challenges presented by software such as After Effects and Premiere.

### Overlays in Cinema
This section, especially relevant to the thematic focus of Professor Zahlten's course, explored layering within cinema. It provided insights into VFX, effects in anime, the multiplane, and green screen technology. Students had a hands-on experience, understanding the synergy between background, middleground, and foreground elements in a 2.5D environment. Practical exercises included prototyping scenes from iconic movies such as Godzilla.

### Digital Tools Overview
The third station demystified the digital tools required to achieve the layering effects introduced in earlier stations. From user-friendly software to more complex systems, platforms like **Canva** and **After Effects** were covered. Students of GENED 1145 delved into techniques like matting, keying, and alpha channel manipulation, crucial for reinterpreting film excerpts.

## Reflections:
The GENED 1145 workshop, under the guidance of Professor Zahlten, seamlessly combined hands-on demonstrations with analytical discourse. The synergistic approach, blending technical skills with broader contextual insights, proved immensely beneficial for the participating students.

## Conclusion:
The "Layering, Compositing, and the Video Essay in Global Japanese Cinema" workshop stood out as a transformative experience for Professor Zahlten's GENED 1145 students. It imparted not just technical acumen but also encouraged a deeper contemplation on the themes of their video essays. The amalgamation of various workshop stations ensured a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.
