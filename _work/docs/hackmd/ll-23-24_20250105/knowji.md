## description
* Generic description: 
    * Knowji keeps track of your learning progress for each word, and it brings back words you are struggling with more frequently than others. It also uses a spaced repetition algorithm that anticipates when you’re about to forget a word and prompts you to drill again before you’re about to forget it. This ensures long-term memory retention of everything you’ve learned.
