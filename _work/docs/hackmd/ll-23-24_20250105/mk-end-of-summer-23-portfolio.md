- unreal
- ai/ml

### tomorrow

### yesterday



- ingest and gear
- s's slides

    * "be aware"
    * zones:
        * augmentations to the workflow and studio
        * ways of using AI in the research process
* one cool thing from sabrina's course
* revised capstone advice and handouts
* ai activities
## topics/tools
* behind the scenes look at what the LL is doing during summer of ai, playful window on the work that is already happening
## rhetoric/story/brand?

    * we can link to anything we want to
* mw-content-lab
* next-js site

## 20230605
### summer of ai daily posts
* buffer of 10 posts ahead
* by the end of June, have enough things to take us through atleast mid if not the end of July



# mk-slaunch-summer-of-ai-notes

Let's do something every single day of the summer. Like a series of 95 things from June 21 to Sept 23.

## post concepts

- links roundups on specific tutorial-ish zones (like don't do our own tutorials unless we have something really specific to add, but curate a collection)
- 

## notes

### what is ai?

We're largely thinking of generative AI and the explosion of creation tools that can help people make things including but certainly not limited to text.

### what is summer?


**summer starts**: Wednesday, 21 June 2023 at 10:57 AM.

(hmm. some sources are saying 10:58 and 10:54--let's investigate.)

**summer ends**: Saturday, 23 September 2023, at 2:50 AM.


### social-post/blog/encyclopedia concept

can we be ready by the summer solstice to
- post once or more per day
    - tool of the day
    - work of the day
    - thought/reflection/theorist of the day
    - random
- mk responsible for expos-ish approach to assignment design, multimodal literacy, that whole ll-approach thing
- typical forms
    - tool-centric how-tos, tutorials
    - updates on news
    - unpacking an object
    - tips and tricks and hacks

### available URLs

many "summer-of-ai" style ones below, but should we more aggressively foreground the higher ed / humanities-arts-research angles?

- thesummerof.ai (slight premium--and godaddy rather than hover)
- thesummerofai.com
- thesummerofai.io
- thesummerofai.dev
- thesummerofai.tools
- thesummerofai.love
- thesummerofai.education
- thesummerofai.wiki
- thesummerofai.quest
- thesummerofai.cool
- thesummerofai.lol
- thesummerofai.wtf
- thesummerofai.fyi
- thesummerofai.work
- thesummerofai.xyz
- thesummerofai.world
- or
    - summerofai.... instead
