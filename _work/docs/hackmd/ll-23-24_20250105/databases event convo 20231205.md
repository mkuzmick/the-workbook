# databases event convo 20231205
* databasing to learn
* it's a big topic, so is there a take on it that's valueable? is there a project to connect it to?
    * how do you classify objects, etc.
    * value in unpacking blackboxes so since databses are the backend of everything, there's nothing you can't understand better by learning about databases
    * thinking about what the units of being are in your domain
* graham is working on the codelap ILP and twisting it - trying to create a front end where you can fill in, that populates an airtable and connects to an API
* sometimes you might want a document database instead of having to define schemas in advance

[codeLab database resource](/P7zK2SD9S7umazTlJmsD6A) - christine and graham worked on this together
