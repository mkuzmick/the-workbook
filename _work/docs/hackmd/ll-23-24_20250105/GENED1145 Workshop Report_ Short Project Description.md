# GENED1145 Workshop Report: Short Project Description

The Learning Lab proudly presented a bespoke workshop for GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema, led by Professor Alexander Zahlten. Our goal was to immerse students in the fascinating intersection of layering, compositing, and the art of the video essay. Through three distinctive stations, we actively engaged students in discussions and hands-on experiences, unraveling the intricacies of anime's form and content.
