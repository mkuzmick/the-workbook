# afvs documentation workshop 2

## notes
* when does documentation of the artwork become guiding the viewer's experience of the work
* there is not a specific/one way to start describing but what you want your reader to take away from you work - that's what you should use to frame your caption
* writing about work is one way to sort out thought
    * avoid the pressure of having one singuar thing to say
    * let the writing help you think through it and then edit it to get to the actual thing you want to say
* goals for today
    * go through each person's caption
    * everyone read each other's so we'll give each other feedback and constructive comments
    * leave with concrete themes to use to talk about and describe your work
    * know which themes are resonating with people the most and hold on to those (even if your work has many themes!)
    * edit the writing about the work in response to the experience today (and this writing will be integrated into the thesis)
* method versus methodology
    * method: how you do something, process, painting/other techniques
    * methodology: theories re: why you're doing what you're doing, where interpretive elements of writing come in through this


## pre-work from Ayhem
* bring in 8 images of your work
* write a longer-form version of a caption about this image
