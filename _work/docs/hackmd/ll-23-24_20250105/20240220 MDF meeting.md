# 20240220 MDF meeting

## updates


## activity goals:
* develop multimodal scaffolding activities that allow you to collect instances of students learning
* and assess that learn (i.e., do something with that documentation)
* consider ways to engage students in generative learning
* use databases to track scaffolding activities/things that students do

## activity steps:
* each group will choose one of the eight generative learning strategies outlined by Fiorella and Mayer
    * summarizing
    * self-testing
    * mapping
    * drawing
    * imagining
    * self-explaining
    * teaching
    * enacting
* each group will choose a multimodal form (explainer video, video essay, podcast, virtual gallery, graphical abstract, scientific poster)
    * identify a KEY MOVE that this form makes
* each group will design a scaffolding activity that would promote generative learning in a course they're working with as an MDF
    * and that integrates SOME multimodal move
    * maybe using your phone to practice getting voiceover
    * or having students illustrate something
    * etc.
    * and that gets students to undertake a meaningful act of making in a multimodal form (in a way that helps them take a step toward a final capstone project like a video essay or podcast)
    * the LLUFs will test these!

## as you build
* [add to an airtable base](https://airtable.com/appmXdzuqpgCenqkw/tblxhKJiDlkkXIKfQ/viwJHRPc2pnulALUD?blocks=hide)
    * moves (activities you'd have students do)
    * generative learning strategies
    * forms
    * disciplines?
    * courses?
* thinking of this as a menu for students to choose from
    * the kind of thing you could share with them and they could use to guide their learning/experimentation/etc.
