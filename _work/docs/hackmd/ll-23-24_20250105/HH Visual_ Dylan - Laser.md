# HH Visual: Dylan - Laser

---

## the ask:
we need to create assets and animations to visualize lasers between anodes and cathodes. 



## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19RXtkDY1U4FUbf6CfP8CpSSSWSwupotN)
* in it, you can find 
    * the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
    * their [1 minute talk video]() for more context 


## the directions:
### for this build...
We want to:
1. create assets that are aesthetically consistent (you can see we have some good options, but there are slightly different colors for example-so we first want to just get assets that match across the slides)
2. create some options for some animations that show the lasers in action.
3. a blender system that matches the chip design-the laser operating in this channel.

At this point we can take pitches/prototypes in either 2D or 3D. We will check in with Dylan next week and will show him options then!

## the workflow:

Please post your ideas and updates as screenshots as often as possible in slack. For now, the [ll-project-hh-visuals](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C06GCAZPGRZ) channel is great!

Please send updated asset files (.blend, .ai, .ae, etc.) as you reach reasonable sharing points. Send a MVP ASAP that we can use as a placeholder and show the scholar as an option. 



we want to build a seamless animation that puts the color and asetheti pang of slides 

gold plates of chips that go on top of blue substrate and then zoom in and see a laser going through those thisng so the slides look the same.
