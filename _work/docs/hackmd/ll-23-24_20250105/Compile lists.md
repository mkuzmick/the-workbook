            prompt used: "Someone compiling lists in a library"
   
## description
Students can use an AI tool to compile a list of key terms, concepts, figures, or works, as a way to test their knowledge in a particular disciplinary domain. The AI tool could be used to generate a superset of data about a topic that the student could then use to evaluate what their own dataset contains. In instances where students' ability to recall from memory the type of content that might comprise these lists, guidelines for appropriate use of an AI tool should be developed.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.

4. First, type your questions and/or your prompt for the AI. Remember: 
    * If you only hit Enter or Return, this will automatically submit your prompt. 
    * You can also add three ticks (''') to indicate a paragraph break if you prefer.
5. For this activity, ask chatGPT (or whichever tool you choose) to give you a list of key terms, works, or figures in a particular sub-discipline or field.

6. To refine these lists, add more specifics. 
    * You can even ask most LLMs to create these lists in tabular format, making it easier to add the AI response to a spreadsheet or document. 
    * This is also an example of where expertise in a given field/area dictates the quality of the eventual AI creation. The more detail you can provide your chosen LLM, the better the result.

## transcript of activity example:
* USER: 
    * Make a list of all of the major Impressionist painters working in Paris in the 1890s.
* AI: 
    * Sure! In the 1890s, some of the major Impressionist painters working in Paris were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt. These artists were part of the Impressionist movement, which focused on capturing the fleeting effects of light and color in their paintings. They often painted outdoors, en plein air, to capture the changing atmosphere and natural light. Is there anything else I can help you with?
* USER: 
    * Can you please make a more exhaustive list, including those that are lesser-known, and perhaps only came through Paris once or only interacted with artists more prominent within France. Please put their names, mediums, best-known works, and inventions/innovations into a table in tabular format.
    * AI:
