## Description and Notes

### Context

#### dani's messy notes
* try different structures for people presenting text, and then getting a mid journey prompt
* Think of framing prompts to get what we want out of this
* Moments.current base (show your images table)
* Describing the tests of the workflow, and testing them.
* Inputs —> outputs (things said and drawn at the overhead camera - we want to see what we can come up with there, so text descriptions, images etc.)


Alex zahlten’s thing - try different structures for people presenting text, and then getting a mid journey prompt
Think of framing prompts to get what we want out of this
Moments.current base (show your images table)
Describing the tests of the workflow, and testing them.
Inputs —> outputs (things said and drawn at the overhead camera - we want to see what we can come up with there, so text descriptions, images etc.)

TIME CRUNCH: 

imagine making images, a poster, an outline, etc.

sometimes prompoted with generic LL things, sometimes with airtable fields 


is there a way to differentiate what kind of form this photo is (overhead, computer, etc.) and how to tell the APi that, and if the generic thing needs to change. 


best definitions of the bok center, LL, harvard, that helps it train. Really practice the logic. 


save everything I do-- recoomend the gandalf thing. Prompting weaknesses, but also how it thinks. 


Think how we can send to a synthesizing prompt, etc.
