## The Mission: Bring Your Sketch to Life in Procreate!
1. Open up Procreate on an iPad and select a screen sized canvas
2. Import an image of your sketch into Procreate by clicking the wrench tool in the top left corner. 
    * Insert a photo and resize it to fit your canvas
3. If you want to give your sketch more definition, add a new layer and trace it in a different color than your sketch!
    * Click on your brush of choice for sketching (HB pencil is a good place to start!)
    * This should open a new menu of options for your brush
    * Turn streamline up to 100% to increase line stability when you draw
4. In the layers panel, click on the "N" next to your sketch layer and turn the opacity down
5. Choose "studio pen" from the inking category and outline the shape in black ink
    * Don't forget to turn up your streamline on the brush!
6. Create a new layer and put it under the line art layer
7. Choose painting brush, choose your color of choice, and painting within the lines (as best you can!)
    * Or, if you'd rather, try dragging the color dot in the top right corner to your closed sketch, and it will fill it in!
* It's important to keep colors and lines on separate layers! Keep your line art on top and your colors in the layer below it.
8. When you're done, export your image by clicking the wrench --> share --> your file type of choice! Or export a video
