            prompt used: "write code."
            
## description
GAI: Students can use an AI tool to assist with writing code, particularly for introductory computer science assignments. The AI tool can be programmed to understand a variety of programming languages, from Python to Java, and can provide guidance and support as students navigate their coding tasks.

For example, if a student is working on an assignment that involves writing a function in Python, they can ask the AI tool for help. The AI can provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how to structure the function, explain the purpose of different elements such as loops or conditionals, and even generate a simple example of a similar function.

In addition to providing guidance, the AI tool can also provide real-time feedback on the student's code. It can identify syntax errors, suggest improvements for efficiency, or point out potential bugs. This immediate feedback can help students learn from their mistakes and improve their coding skills more quickly.

The AI tool can also be used to challenge and extend the students' learning. Once a student has completed an assignment, the AI can generate additional, more complex coding tasks that build on the concepts covered in the assignment.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for learning to code, it is important to ensure that students are not overly reliant on it. Coding involves problem-solving and critical thinking skills that can only be developed through practice and perseverance. Therefore, educators may want to set guidelines for when and how the AI tool should be used, to ensure that it is enhancing, not hindering, the learning process.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
