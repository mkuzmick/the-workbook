## Key to Fill Ratios and 3 Point Lighting

Lighting is mostly a creative tool, meaning there are many ways to do it and most of them have valid reason. But, there are some methods that are simply more frequently put into use than others. 

Three Point Lighting is the most frequently talked about approach to lighting a subject. But in truth, I've found this to be a bit of a misnomer, as you don't always require 3 points of light in a 3 point lighting setup.

Most commonly, you'll find that a Key light and a Back light are the most useful to have, but the Fill light can be replaced by a bounce, a white wall, or even ignored altogether, depending on some attributes of your key light. 

But to start, you should set up your Key light, this is most commonly placed between 30 and 45 degrees from the front of your subject. This is most commonly your brightest light, it will determine your exposure most of the time. Next, determine if this should be a hard or soft light, if you're using a soft Key light, this can negate the need for a ![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bVuicRH-J4/maxresdefault.jpg)

Next, you'll decide your Key to Fill Ratio. This is the difference between the levels of brightness between each side of your subject's face, with your Key being the brighter of the two. 

**It's extremely common in interviews to light at a relatively low ratio.**

If you remember back to our metering exercises, you can determine this difference mathematically by metering each side of your subject's face. This is most important to happen when you're shooting at a high ratio, as you run a greater risk of over or under exposing one side of your subject's face.
