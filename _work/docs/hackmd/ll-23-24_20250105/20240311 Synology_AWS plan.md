# State of the Synologies as of 20240311

The server room is hot again so ingesting has come to a halt. Before it stopped here is what was going on:

Here is a [link to the airtable](https://airtable.com/appN3ENpr8V8BO8GA/shrn8XsJ8az0uGwEh) that has the locations of every shoot. 

## Synology
I am currently pushing to synology 06_03b and 11_01. I had also been pushing footage to 09_03 that has recently filled up. 

06_03b and 11_01 has a good amount of storage space left.

09_03 has synology 2 and synology 4 backed up on it. This is taking up a large amount of space. Once the synologies come back on I am going to check through redundancies of footage/media. 

Smaller files such as assets and project files have been moved to synology 09_01 for now freeing up some space.

Once the synologies are back on I can start backing up footage to 09_03.

## Proxy
Proxies are mostly up to date except for some shoots from Friday(20240308) as well as the all day drives from Thursday (20240308). 

They will be proxied and put on synology 10 ASAP.

## AWS
I am currently working on backing up any missing shoots from September 2023. These take awhile because the files are quite large. They are from when we recorded all day on the amx as well.

After that I will be pushing shoots from December 2023 to the present day. This will have to wait until the synologies can be turned on again as I am pushing footage from a RAID.

## Google Drive Back Up
I currently have the google drive backed up on a synology. I do remember backing it up to a synology. I believe I backed it up to synology 6. Otherwise it may be on synology 8. Once this information is available it will be added to the [footage tracking airtable](https://airtable.com/appN3ENpr8V8BO8GA/shrn8XsJ8az0uGwEh). 


## Total storage:
539.48 TB
