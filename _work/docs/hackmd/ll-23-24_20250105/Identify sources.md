# Identify sources

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0609PELVL7/oue_016.png?pub_secret=99810cf306)

            prompt used: "Identify sources."
            
## description
GAI: Students can use an AI tool to identify sources on a specific topic, such as recent publications about semiconductors. The AI tool can be programmed to search through a vast database of academic articles, books, and other scholarly materials, identifying key sources that discuss the specified topic.

For example, a student might prompt the AI with a request like "List five recent publications about semiconductors." The AI can then generate a list of relevant publications, providing the title, author, publication date, and a brief summary for each source. This can save students time and effort in their initial research, allowing them to focus on reading and analyzing the sources.

In addition to identifying sources, the AI tool can also help students organize their research. It can group sources by theme or argument, suggest a structure for the literature review based on the sources identified, or even generate a preliminary bibliography.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for identifying sources, it is important to note that it may sometimes generate inaccurate or 'hallucinated' citations. Therefore, students should always verify the accuracy of the AI-generated citations by checking the original sources. Furthermore, the AI tool should not replace critical reading and analysis. Students should still read the sources themselves, evaluate their credibility, and formulate their own understanding of the arguments. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other research skills and strategies.


## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
