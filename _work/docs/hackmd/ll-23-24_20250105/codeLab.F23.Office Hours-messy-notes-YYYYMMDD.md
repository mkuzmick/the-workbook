# codeLab.F23.Office Hours-messy-notes-20231003

## messy notes
goals
* christine wants something structured about designing the backend of databases

activity ideas
* mk suggested that folks can play around with an existing database if they have tme

things to include in a resource
* which database tools can integrate into next apps
    * potentially chatgpt can make a glossary of diff database tools?
    * explain why we use airtable, but side quests where folks can use other tools instead
* some tutorials on databases ([pull out links from this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6-p_T_7cYk7lxB4kvSmg-fZn7f4qoQCTEFWWr9jguw/edit#heading=h.g414n3bbzsg7))
* core concepts CD is learning from tutorials

messy notes
* cd asked if better to design a resource? or designing a tooltime
    * mk said for sure resource. and then folks can let us know if they want to meet up in person
    * mk said in the past we've done 'databaseing to learn' - for any domain, what are the entities, and what are their properties, and how do they relate, etc.
* figure out what people are using right now

* what data to use?
    * some modalities of interaction we'd use more frequently. types of interactions where there might be many many more, that we'd like to use during a workshop.
        * ex) playing the drum on space bar
        * where there's a lot of interactions happening
        * real-time transcriptions
            * amazon and google offer word level transcription - an array of word objects, for every single word. instead of readable text
        * building technical infrastructure that can/should be used in many ways
        * what are the things that happen many times
* key is to think about what goes beyond the airtable limit? that's related to the notes above about many many interactions
* separately, codeLab can help with workflow scripts that support events (and can maintain those in airtable because that will not go beyond airtable's bandwith/limits)
* design a hackathon that brings together teams with different lab members and everyone designs, say, mdf player cards



tutorials
try out some vercel starters (use chatgpt! trying to understand this next starter app i cloaned, explain file by file)
