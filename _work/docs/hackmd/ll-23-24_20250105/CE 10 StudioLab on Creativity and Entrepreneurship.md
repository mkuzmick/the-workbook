# CE 10 StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship

In CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship, students developed pitch videos for their entrepreneurial projects. They began with a business model canvas and received feedback from Hunt Lambert, which was then used to train an OpenAI bot. This bot provided additional, nuanced feedback on their pitches, offering a unique interactive learning experience. Despite some challenges in fine-tuning the AI, this approach added significant value to the students' entrepreneurial understanding and project development.

### [Resources & Models (shared with students prior to their LL session)](https://hackmd.io/0Ld4a6gMQbyOkLN1n6lCJw?view)
* watch [this iconic pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndnmtz8-S5I). Notice how the visual and the oral elements work together, without one distracting from the other, but rather supporting each other. Note this idea of a "visual home base" demonstrated here. We may get you to try to come up with your own visual home base during the workshop.
* take a look at some of these [pitch decks](https://pitch.com/blog/15-great-pitch-decks-from-successful-startups). What patterns do find emerging among them? What do they have in common? What is (or sometimes, isn't) "working" for you? Was there one that stood out to you more than the others? We may ask you to try to articualte why it stood out to you when you come in.
* watch this [talk on communicating your ideas through storytelling structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk). It will give you some great framing and preparation for what we will be workshopping together on the 25th.
