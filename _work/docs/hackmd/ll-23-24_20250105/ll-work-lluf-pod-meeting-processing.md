## steps

### create the library and the events

- in the `_fcpx` folder of your drive, create a new library called `lluf-pod-YOURPOD-processing-YYYYMMDD-XX` where XX are your initials and YYYYMMDD is today's date (or the date you change the library). Once you have a pod processing library, you will try to keep augmenting it over time.
- in the library, create four events:
    - one called `footage`
    - one called `utils` for your multiclips and compound clips
    - one called `projects` for your timelines
    - one called `assets` for all of your non-footage media assets (music, stills, etc)
- in the `footage` folder, ingest your first pod shoot, being careful to
    1. NOT to have "copy to library" checked, but, rather "leave files in place" 
    2. be sure to ingest at the shootfolder level and have "from folders" checked under "Keywords" (Finder tags are optional--we don't use them, but you might).
    - NOTE: if you get an error about files that can't be imported like `.txt` files, don't worry
- now in the footage folder, you'll see a large array of keywords. We will sort these into two folders:
    - create a folder called `events` and drag all the date-based keywords in there
    - create a folder called `sources` and drag all the camera or other source-based folders in there

### create compound clips and multicam

This is going to seem a little duplicative in some ways, but it is going to help us down the line.

- find the clip in the event that has the EARLIEST start timecode. 
- Right click this clip and initiate a multiclip using its timecode.


1. for each clip, select it and then click




### julia notes
- One kind of project you can make is a "best looking" montage. Piece together visually interesting shots (e.g that depict engaged conversation, laughing, movement, reactions) sequentially to make something like an "event recap" montage that might have music in the background - you need not pay attention to sound because the goal of this project is not to communicate the content of the event at the language level but to capture its development, actors, and vibe. 
  - POSSIBLE NAMES include:
  - 1. aesthetic-recap
  - 2. best-looking-shots
  - 3. silent-recap 
  - 4. pod-vibe-roundup
  - 5. aesthetic-summary
