# AI as Foil (for as long as this still works)

            prompt used: "Use ChatGPT responses as teaching material, working with students to identify AI limitations in art and communication."
            
## description
GAI: Educators can use an AI tool like ChatGPT as a foil in courses where identifying the uniquely human elements of a form of art or communication is central, such as theatre and dance, visual art, or writing. By presenting the AI with a prompt and using its response as teaching material, educators can work with students to identify the ways in which the AI's response falls short of an expert human response.

For example, in a theatre course, the AI could be prompted to write a monologue for a character. The resulting monologue could then be analyzed in class, with students identifying areas where the AI's understanding of human emotion, motivation, or context might be lacking. This exercise can help students appreciate the complexity of human expression and the subtleties of performance that might be difficult for an AI to replicate.

Similarly, in a visual art course, the AI could be asked to generate a description or interpretation of a piece of art. Students could then compare the AI's response with their own interpretations, discussing the ways in which the AI might miss the emotional impact, cultural context, or personal connection that a human viewer might experience.

In addition to serving as a foil, the AI tool can also provide a benchmark for students, helping them understand the expectations for their own work. By identifying the shortcomings of the AI's responses, students can gain a clearer understanding of what is expected of them in terms of critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable teaching aid, it is important to remember that it is not a substitute for human expertise and judgment. The use of the AI tool should be balanced with other teaching methods and strategies, ensuring that students are also exposed to expert human responses and perspectives.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
