# MCBDEPT-Amanda Whipple Gene Regulation and Epigenetics Course Development-research-develop-idea

## Description and Notes

### Context
MCB197 is a gene regulation and epigenetics course aimed for pre-med students where they learn science from the bench-side and its applications on the bed-side. One of the goals of this course is synthesize and communicate scientific ideas. They will exsercise these skills using graphicas made on Biorender. They will have two assigments that employ these skills: an initial graphical abstract, and a capstone oral presentation. 

### Deliverables
- Biorender and scientific illustration workshop: 
    - fundamental concepts of grapic design 
    - Biorender demo
