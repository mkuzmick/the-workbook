# winter show and tell in progress
## CD
### mdf meta stuff
MDF theme for the spring: documentation and curation

christine is thinking about how would teach others (mdfs) to do documentation and curation - documenting a process, curating moments of learning, putting together student projects

there are 6 sessions. 

there are old things we've done that we can do again
* airtable databasing to learn
* all of the doc style video capture and editing

but if there are new things people want to pitch to include, that's what we can pitch
### work
* next gallery of mdf projects - print and also get markdown


## MW
for the future
* get back to content curation
    * two fold: our documentation for reporting (more internal?), and social content (external where they can see it)
* ai bots

## CC
* computers computers computers
* stable diffusion functioning repo on colab

## SC
* threeJS
    * javascript
    * wants to build a gallery space that people can put digital objects in OR building a gallery space for things in the space that are 3d-scanned


## MK
* space
    * goals: 
        * less tech visible, and have everything mobile
        * fellows do a lot with physical materials and still capture that
* momentbot has been ported over to 101bots
* colabs to be the initial, simplest working concept
* we now have AWS and azure accounts that the GAICA folks are administering
