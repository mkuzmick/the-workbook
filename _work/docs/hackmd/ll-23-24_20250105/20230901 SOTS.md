# state of the system 20230901
* build in aitable, scripted, no typing in data, someone could select two things manually and say that's a moment. and that would create a moment
* this is to have the span of time
* one slack message that gets decorated with emojis instead of different emojis
* "interview with so and so" - click start emoji, and then click stop emoji, and maybe other emojis throughout
* linking records is more complicated. most important to link is the person who sent it

random
* everything that is a tag it's cool to have a emoji for (eventually)
to do- 
* emojis - 
    * moment bot's head
    * start/go
    * stop
* create a guide for people on how to do this

flow
* write a message - that will be the title of the moment
* if you give the moment bot emoji to a message, that will make it a moment record
* every emoji you add after, will update that message with reacted 


jordan's other hopes and dreams
* jordan would like to be ablet to visualize what the llufs are working, the ratios of the time they spent on each thing
    * mk said he'd be happy to help jk think about how to do this in airtable
    * jk said we should think about whether to do this by shift or by week
    * mk said jordan could just train people to type start and stop when they're doing something
    * and he could capture the comments in the thread in a long text field



updates
* mk
    * local websites are great and we don't have to ask for permission as part of event lab
* dd 
    * narrow down "task types" there's too many - do this on cards together and think through tree structure


* metaproject or project specific slack channels - do we already have a spot in airtable for this?
    * "ll-client-erika-bailey" - dani will create and invite in the channel
    * add to slackchannel airtable (make sure to add emojis)
    *
