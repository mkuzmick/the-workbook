### activity draft

Activity
**Individual Reflection (2 minutes):** Think about the courses that have had the biggest impact on you. On separate cards, write down the names of these courses. Try to include some unexpected or outlier courses that others might not anticipate. For each course, jot down a brief note about what specifically made it memorable (e.g., the course content, a particular assignment, the professor).
**Group Discussion (8 minutes):** In your group of three (or pairs, as assigned), lay out your cards in an organized grid. Discuss any interesting patterns or unexpected courses that emerge from your collective experiences.
**Micro Presentations (5 minutes):** Based on your discussion, each group member will prepare a brief presentation to share in your group. Consider what your unique educational experiences suggest about the future of higher education. What do these unexpected connections or standout courses tell us?

You might want to start with something like: "Hi, I'm ______. The most unexpected thing I've done is ______, and here's why it's not actually disconnected from my life..."

You could conclude with a statement like: "What this tells us about higher education is ____" or "Given these experiences, what Harvard should try to do in the Arts and Humanities/Social Sciences is _______".

**Share Out (5 minutes):** We'll ask for a few volunteers to share their presentations with the whole group.
