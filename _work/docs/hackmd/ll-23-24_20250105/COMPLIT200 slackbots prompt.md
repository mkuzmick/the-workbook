# COMPLIT 200 Slackbots Development Prompt: Enhancing Interactive Learning

## Course Description
In COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy: Imagination, Invention, Radical Pedagogy, students explore structural, combinatory, and generative thinking about storytelling through the lens of Munari, Rodari, and Calvino. The course combines literary theory and history with computer-assisted creation, using textual and visual AI tools, culminating in a curated volume of AI folktales.

## Context
This project involves creating Slackbots to provide interactive, educational content that aligns with the course material. We seek innovative and practical Slackbot ideas that can enhance the learning experience.

## Elements
- Development of engaging Slackbots
- Integration of course-relevant content
- Creative and educational tool design

### Deliverable
Proposals for Slackbot ideas can be presented in a meeting or sent via Slack, either as plain text, HackMD links, or video pitches.
