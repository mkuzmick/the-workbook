# Prompt: EXPOS20GIVEN Artifact Capture Resource Development

## Background
For Greg Given's EXPOS20 course, "Does That Belong in a Museum?", students will be choosing an object from Harvardâ€™s own collections to write a research paper on, which will then be translated into a capstone project. As part of both projects, students will need to *capture* their object. For students choosing objects that are not on display, or where image capture is not allowed, they will need to find images from online. But for students whose objects are on display, they may choose to take photos or 3D scan the objects.

## Ask
We'd like to send back to the instructor a resource to share with the students on Artifact Capture, made up of:
1. a realityLab created hackMD resource 3d scanning options for the phone (with how to's)
2. an avLab created hackMD resource on museum photography how-to's
    - covering things like handling glass and reflections

### Timeline
* we'd like to send this ideally by mid October!
