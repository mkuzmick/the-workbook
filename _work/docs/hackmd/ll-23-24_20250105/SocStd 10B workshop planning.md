# SocStd 10B workshop planning

## basic plan
* icebreaker
    * favorite passage from foucault
    * name on card
* make 3-minute presentation
    * come up with an analogy, example, historical moment you can walk us through to help us understand the shift from punishment to discipline
    * find a key quote
    * make a key illustration
    * use media to explain this thing


## passages
On Power:

“In short this power is exercised rather than possessed” (26).

On the old form of punishment:

“The public execution, then, has a juridico-political function. It is a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is reconstituted” (48).

On Panopticism:

“We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we brin to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism” (217).

On Discipline more generally:

“Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?” (228).

## concepts
* Obedient Subject
* Discipline
* Panopticism
* Spectacle
* Monarch: Torture :: Society: Discipline
* Omnipresent
* Discreet
* Decentralized
* Impersonal

## questions
* How does power work in a discipline-based society?
* What does “power produces knowledge” mean?
* How does power work in a torture-based society?

## mechanic
* each group gets a pack
* another group gets to add something to the pack to mess with the other group
* group will try to explain something about foucault to a general audience to help audience understand totality of the book
* in the form of a 3minute presentation
* rosie - we have this array of buttons with key terms
* we have these four passages printed out
* these three questions
* should we give students a choice or just assign them randomly

## game show mechanics for icebreaker
* learn the space
    * how to use the overhead
    * how to use the shelves
* each of them gets a term and you have to get your partner to guess your term in a catchphrase way, without using the term
    * do this publicly

## to do
* make a sheet with parameters for the activity
    * [recipe card set of instructions](/VJJ47xS3SG2ymiA3IdbmcA)
* concept cards

## order
* icebreaker
    * 1 song to come up with what you're going to say taboo-style
* grab your pack
    * take 2 songs to take a look at your pack
    * talk with your partner about what you're going to do
    * take 1 song to pick RANDOM OBJECT from shelves to mess with another group
* make your presentation
    * 45 mins or so
