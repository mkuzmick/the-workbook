## key info to complete
### More thought out, specific title: 
Mixed Media Translation Workshop
### 2-3 sentence description:
This is for a course on translation. For the final projects, students get to translate a work, not just from one language to another, but from one medium to another. This is a worship designed to get them to think in broad expansive and permiental ways about what those mixed media translations might involve. Students work with poems from the course along with tools of video, art, music, theatrical production, to quickly prototype translations.
