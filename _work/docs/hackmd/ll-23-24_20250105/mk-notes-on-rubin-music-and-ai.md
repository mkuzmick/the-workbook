# mk-notes-on-rubin-music-and-ai

- eno studio as instrument
- rubin's listening to flow of experience as being less about the new agey californiaisms and more about the situations created by recording technologies and workflows
- emergent phenomena result (not just Rubin's mystical arrivals of the new, but also Eno's more worked out sense that feedback loops and other emergent elements yield things we can't predict)
- seeing this wake you create in the waters surrounding your intervention
- music was the perfect place for this to happen first. Reasons? high-fidelity recording. multi-tracking. editing. mixing. remixing. sampling.
- now this is going to happen everywhere.
- but once everywhere, it's beyond the capacity of the human to do it alone.
- enter AI.
