## messy notes
* eventLab folks will know how to do things in realtime
* codeLab folks will make galleries
* avLab folks will editing after the fact
* llufs should be getting some instructions from lab leaders about what they're good at
* but we should build infrastructure for what the basics are
    * processing an event
        * grabbing stills
        * making a gif
* lluf event sign ups could be linked to other tables

### add these channels and add to channelConfig 
* ll-project-clean (change before and after)
* ll-project-welcome 
* ll-project-content (change contentLab)
### other slack things
* ll-llufs-23-24
* rename ll-undergrad fellows to ll-llufs-22-23
* rename people-llufs to llufs-2016-2020
### flow for llufs
* launch shift with JK or MK
* then sign up for 15 hours of basics
* schedule 20 hours for ILP, then JK checks in with one of the lab leads and the lluf
* then done with ILP, they can schedule recurring 6 hours
