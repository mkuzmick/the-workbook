            prompt used: "translating a text, texts side by side. one tech, one arcahic"
      
## description
Students could use an AI tool like chatGPT to produce a translation of a text they're studying in a course, or even to test out whether their own translation of a term or text is accurate. This could enable a student to make an argument about a particular word choice, phrase, etc. and analyze that term's profound implications, once they've gotten some feedback from the AI about the term's meaning.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT
3. For this activity
    * paste in the text in its original language
    * ask chatGPT to help you translate a specific term or phrase in that passage
    * prompt it to explore whether other meanings of that term or passage are possible
4. Another version of this activity:
    * ask chatGPT to translate a passage
    * ask it to translate it in a particular prose style 

## example
For reference, [here is the translation Media & Design Fellow Lara Norgaard did of this story](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/special-feature/fruit-maps-rio-johan/) from Indonesian to English.

We're going to ask GPT to help us identify terms that have multiple possible connotations.

USER: I am translating a text from Indonesian into English.

Here is the Indonesian text:

"Si Manggis, yang terkenal paling menawan sekebun itu, menyadari ada yang ganjil dengan pasangannya, Nanas. Suatu hari dia buntuti Nanas, dan dia dapati pasangannya tersebut ternyata diam-diam telah berselingkuh dengan Apel, sahabat dekatnya sendiri. Tega-teganya, Apel! Padahal berdasarkan curhat-curhat dan gelagat Apel selama ini, Manggis meyakini sahabatnya itu jatuh cinta pada Pir. Ironisnya Pir sendiri sudah punya pasangan resmi, Bluberi. Meskipun demikian sudah bukan rahasia lagi kalau Pir sering selingkuh di sana-sini; Bluberi juga demikian, bedanya dia cuma selingkuh dengan satu orang, Salak. Banyak yang jatuh cinta dengan Salak konon karena kulitnya yang kasar dan keras, tanda-tanda eksotis untuk kebanyakan. Salak sendiri sebetulnya cuma punya satu perasaan pada seseorang, Jambu, yang sayangnya tidak membalas perasaannya. Jambu, pernah bercinta satu kali dengan Manggis; percintaan tersebut terus terkenang secara indah di kepala yang pertama, sayangnya yang kedua tak lebih menganggapnya sebagai cina satu malam belaka.
Suatu hari muncul buah bernama Rumpulum, dan dia mengaku sebagai anak dari Manggis dan Nanas. Tapi Manggis tidak mau mengakui. Dan anak itu pun berubah pikiran dan mengaku sebagai hasil selingkuh antara Nanas dan Apel. Tapi Nanas bersumpah pada Manggis tak pernah melakukan apa pun dengan Apel. Rumpulum berubah lagi, kini mengklaim sebagai anak dari Apel dan Pir. Ini pun disangkah Pir dengan alasan mana mungkin dia mau bercinta dengan makhluk seperti Apel. “Mungkin anak Pir dan Bluberi?” Bluberi dengan sinis menjawab, “Heh, yakin kau bocah? Kau tahu Pir sudah bercinta dengan berapa banyak buah?” “Bagaimana kalau Bluberi dan Salak?” “Nah, kau tahu,” kata Bluberi lagi, “ini lebih masuk akal, sebab Salak bukan Pir: dia cenderung setia bercinta dengan satu buah dalam satu periode. Tapi biar kuberitahu, si Salak pernah main serong dengan perempuan lain selain aku; tahu siapa? Si Jambu.” “Jadi aku anak Jambu dan Salak?” “Coba tanya si Jambu!” Dan ketika Rumpulum menemui Jambu, jawaban yang didapatnya adalah: “Duh . . . aduh, duh, duh, Nak, kamu hasil percintaanku dengan Jambu dan Salak? Yakin kamu? Sebab aku juga pernah bercinta satu kali dengan Manggis. Bisa juga kamu anak aku dan Manggis kan? Sudah kamu tanya Manggis?”
Dan Rumpulum kembali menemui Manggis . . ."

And here is my English translation:

"Mangosteen, known as the most captivating in the garden, realized that something was off with its partner, Pineapple. One day, it followed Pineapple and discovered that Pineapple had secretly been having an affair with Apple, Mangosteen's close friend. How could you, Apple! Considering from all the heart-to-heart talks and Apple's behavior all this time, Mangosteen believed that Apple was in love with Pear. Ironically, Pear already had an official partner, Blueberry. However, it was no secret that Pear often cheated here and there; so did Blueberry, but the difference was that Blueberry only cheated with one individual, Snakefruit. Many fell in love with Snakefruit, allegedly because of its rough and hard skin, signs of exoticism for most. Snakefruit, in reality, only had feelings for one person, Guava, who sadly did not reciprocate. Guava once had a romantic fling with Mangosteen; a memory that lingered beautifully in the former's mind, unfortunately, the latter saw it merely as a one-night stand.
One day, a fruit named Rumpulum appeared, claiming to be the child of Mangosteen and Pineapple. But Mangosteen denied it. Then the child changed its claim, saying it was the result of an affair between Pineapple and Apple. But Pineapple swore to Mangosteen that nothing ever happened between them. Rumpulum changed its claim again, now stating it was the child of Apple and Pear. This was also doubted by Pear, arguing how it would ever want to mate with a creature like Apple. "Perhaps Pear and Blueberry's child?" Blueberry replied sarcastically, "Are you sure, kid? Do you know how many fruits Pear has been with?" "What about Blueberry and Snakefruit?" "Now, you know," Blueberry responded, "this makes more sense, because Snakefruit is not Pear: it tends to be faithful to one fruit in a given period. But let me tell you, Snakefruit once cheated with another female besides me; know who? It's Guava." "So, am I the child of Guava and Snakefruit?" "Try asking Guava!" And when Rumpulum approached Guava, the answer was, "Oh dear... oh, oh, oh, kid, are you the result of my love affair with Guava and Snakefruit? Are you sure? Because I also had a fling once with Mangosteen. It's possible you're my child with Mangosteen, right? Have you asked Mangosteen?"
And Rumpulum went back to Mangosteen..."

Can you point me to terms that have multiple possible connotations so I can be sure that my translation captures the essence of the language as accurately as possible?

AI:

Sure, I'd be happy to help. Here are some terms that might have multiple possible connotations in the text:

"Si Manggis" - The term "Si" in Indonesian is a colloquial way to refer to someone, often used to create a sense of familiarity or endearment. It's similar to "Mr." or "Ms." in English, but more informal. In your translation, you've simply used "Mangosteen," which is accurate, but you might consider adding a colloquial term like "Old" or "Mister" to capture the familiarity of the original text.

"Menawan" - This term can mean "captivating," "charming," or "attractive." You've translated it as "captivating," which works, but depending on the context, one of the other translations might be more appropriate.

"Buntuti" - This term can mean "follow," "tail," or "shadow." You've translated it as "follow," which is accurate, but depending on the context, one of the other translations might be more fitting.

"Curhat" - This is a colloquial term for sharing one's feelings or problems, similar to "pouring one's heart out." Your translation as "heart-to-heart talks" captures this well.

"Selingkuh" - This term can mean "cheat," "have an affair," or "be unfaithful." You've translated it as "having an affair," which is accurate, but depending on the context, one of the other translations might be more appropriate.

"Main serong" - This is a colloquial term for cheating or having an affair. Your translation as "cheated" captures this well.

"Cina satu malam" - This term literally translates to "one-night china," but it's a colloquial term for a one-night stand. Your translation as "one-night stand" is accurate.

"Rumpulum" - This appears to be a made-up name for a fruit, so there's no direct translation. Your decision to keep it as "Rumpulum" in the English translation is appropriate.

"Bocah" - This term can mean "kid," "child," or "boy." You've translated it as "kid," which is accurate, but depending on the context, one of the other translations might be more appropriate.

"Percintaan" - This term can mean "love affair," "romance," or "love." You've translated it as "love affair," which is accurate, but depending on the context, one of the other translations might be more appropriate.

Remember that connotations can vary depending on the context, so it's important to consider the overall tone and message of the text when choosing your translations.
