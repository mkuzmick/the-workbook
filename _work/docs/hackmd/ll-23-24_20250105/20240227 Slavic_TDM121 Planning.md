# 20240227 Slavic/TDM121 Planning

## Plan
1. critical: how you anlayze mutlimodal data, mark it up
    - ex. film strips to talk about the rate of spinning
2. ways of integrating that into a visual argument
    - could involve paper prototyping under the overhead. if you were to make a visual essay comparing these two, etc. on the spot they have to make an argument
3. pose analyis/motion capture

## Materials we want
* lots of paper print outs of dance things they can analyze
    * so sourcing media from the syllabus & from Matilde email
        * then confirm with mk what exactly we want film strips of
* annotated documentation from matilde's email
* theoretical framework
    * the archive being foot to foot. one person danced it one way, and someone learned from then, etc. so the body becomes the archive. how this becomes determined over time, extrinsic cultural pressures, etc.

## messy notes
* telephone movement thing as an ice breaker?
    * one pantomime motion and a few abstract things
    * anna said could they tell part of the swan lake story about how you got the curse
    * go into the classroom, then everyone does an isolated movement on the green screen and we print that out
* we can also talk about capturing (re: what goes into the documentation)
    * filming for purposes of documentation vs. when the camera is it's own camera
* anna said we probably don't want the terms
    * mk said maybe 1 or 2 things. if it's helpful for their visual argument
    * maybe the ice breaker involves one term
    * test friday wth llufs


## action items
* llufs media sourcing
* test things friday (icebreaker, and other things)
    * anything that speeds up the process of capturing people on stage and printing
