Okay, so my essay focuses on rap therapy and its potential benefits for young people. I was inspired by this article which contains quotes from numerous individuals about rap and hip-hop culture. Many believe it to be detrimental to youth. This notion is rooted in the idea that rap and hip-hop culture is deeply ingrained in daily life, influencing how people dress, talk, and behave. Some argue this influence can be harmful.

My first source is by David A. Ross, titled "Adolescent Wellbeing." It provides both subjective and objective definitions of well-being. This sets a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of tools like rap therapy. If such tools can help adolescents achieve this definition of well-being, they may be deemed valuable.

I refer back to the aforementioned article, as it paints a comprehensive picture of rap therapy and hip-hop. It delves into the historical context, explaining why certain perceptions of rap and hip-hop exist. Additionally, it offers anecdotes from therapists who have integrated rap therapy into their practices, highlighting both successes and challenges.

Another source I'm using is by Michael Thot. It discusses how music therapy can aid cognitive rehabilitation after traumatic brain injuries, such as strokes. This research underscores the broader benefits of music therapy, not limited to rap, in enhancing well-being, especially for those battling depression or anxiety.

I've also found an intriguing soundtrack on SoundCloud titled "The Mindfulness Life Project Hip-Hop." It repurposes popular rap and hip-hop beats, but with lyrics that promote well-being in young adults.

Lastly, I've included a J. Cole interview. It hints at the idea that while music therapy is beneficial, its combination with mindfulness techniques might be even more impactful. J. Cole shares that before performances or recording sessions, he practices breathing techniques similar to those we study in class.

I'm considering adding more sources, but this is where I'm at currently.
