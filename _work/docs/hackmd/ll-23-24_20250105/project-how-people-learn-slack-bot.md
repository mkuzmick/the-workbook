23 students
[bok seminar canvas site](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/135131)
[metaproject folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kdkW3bNEtefpA_qkPFj4tOG3f766jlBf?usp=drive_link)

things to get:
- syllabus
- other canvas info
- readings for all weeks
    - but especially for the weeks of feb 14 and 21

good to think about through slack
* experiment with the bot as is
* training stage/edit your teacher stage etc.
* some final stage is unlocked

## things to make

- range of options
    - make an assistant in the openAI interface and get them to play with it
    - playgrounds for the APIs 
    - python notebook
    - slack bot
    - web interface
    - slack bot group
    - something they can play with themselves
- would be good to connect to the reading
- would be great if they could interact with it (design it)
- 

## logistics
* our goal is to have a bot on the 14th
* there's no workshop request, she'll just say you'll receive a slack invitation to LL-experimental

## to do
* research pros and cons of gpts vs assistances, other above options etc.
* try a few quick proofs of concept using the different range of options
* think about the various little steps that could be python singles that we can give to people
    * list all of the main methods of the major APIs and make sure we have a single for all of those methods
    *
