# GENED1145 Workshop Report: Longer Project Description
The Learning Lab, in collaboration with Professor Alexander Zahlten, curated an intensive workshop tailored specifically for the students of GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema. Our mission was to delve deep into the layered nuances of Japanese cinema, dissecting its many facets and illuminating the rich tapestry of techniques that make this genre both iconic and captivating. By bridging traditional film analysis with hands-on experimentation, we aimed to provide students with a holistic view of cinema's complex realm.

Through a series of meticulously designed stations, we embarked on a journey from the rudimentary elements of visual arguments to the more advanced applications in cinema overlays. Each station was crafted to not just educate but to actively immerse students in the dynamic interplay of images, graphics, and cinematic effects. With the inclusion of digital tools and their potential, we ensured that students left with a comprehensive toolkit, ready to explore, analyze, and create within the realm of Global Japanese Cinema. This workshop was a testament to the Learning Lab's commitment to enhancing academic experiences, bringing abstract concepts to life, and nurturing the next generation of film enthusiasts and analysts.
