Certainly! Based on the provided transcript, it seems the workshop is centered around the theme of "translation" â€” particularly translating between mediums and the nuances that arise in that process. The activities are deeply engaged with exploring translation through paper, voice, music, and time/space.

**Workshop Plan: "Translating Mediums"**

1.  **Introduction (15 minutes)**
    
    -   Brief overview of the workshop objectives.
    -   Icebreaker activity: Quick round of introductions, participants share their favorite medium of expression (e.g., painting, music, writing).
2.  **Theoretical Framework (20 minutes)**
    
    -   Present the idea of translation beyond language: moving between mediums.
    -   Discuss Walter Benjamin's take on translation and its impact on our perception of original work.
    -   Introduce the poetry and texts to be used throughout the workshop.
3.  **Station Rotations (60 minutes total, 15 minutes per station)**
    
    -   **Music & Voice Station**:
        
        -   Participants take turns reading aloud selected text.
        -   Musicians interpret and accompany the readings with piano.
        -   Considerations: Ensure readers and musicians are in close proximity for synergy. Prepare the environment for capturing clean waveforms.
    -   **Paper Materiality Station**:
        
        -   Explore the book as an artifact, emphasizing the tactile nature.
        -   Challenge: Translate a textual idea into a paper format.
    -   **Time & Space Station**:
        
        -   Look at printed waveforms and filmstrips.
        -   Translate a text to a filmstrip format, emphasizing its temporal nature.
        -   Utilize software/tools to showcase real-time waveforms and spectrograms.
    -   **Body & Voice Interpretation Station**:
        
        -   Focus on the human element: how text is humanized and transformed when read aloud.
        -   Participants to record their own readings.
4.  **Group Discussion and Reflection (20 minutes)**
    
    -   Groups share their experiences from each station.
    -   Discuss: How did the medium of translation change your perception of the original text?
    -   Showcase the waveforms and spectrograms captured.
5.  **Application & Exploration (25 minutes)**
    
    -   Participants choose a medium and create their own translations of a provided text. This can be done individually or in pairs.
    -   This is a hands-on activity, emphasizing creativity and exploration.
6.  **Show & Tell (15 minutes)**
    
    -   Participants share their translations with the group, explaining their thought process and the nuances they discovered.
7.  **Conclusion & Feedback (10 minutes)**
    
    -   Summarize the day's activities and findings.
    -   Hand out feedback forms or conduct a quick survey to gauge the participants' experiences and gather suggestions for future workshops.

**Materials Needed**:

1.  Selected texts/poetry for translation.
2.  Musical instruments (primarily a piano).
3.  Recording equipment.
4.  Computers with waveform/spectrogram software.
5.  Printouts of waveforms, filmstrips, and spectrograms.
6.  Art supplies for the paper station (paper, scissors, markers, etc.).
7.  Feedback forms or digital survey platform.

**Preparation Checklist**:

1.  Prepare the venue: Set up stations, arrange seating, and check technical equipment.
2.  Gather and organize materials for each station.
3.  Run a test for the recording and software functionalities.
4.  Print necessary documents and texts.
5.  Ensure all participants have been informed of the schedule and any pre-workshop requirements.

This workshop encourages a multi-sensory exploration of translation, tapping into auditory, visual, tactile, and cognitive faculties. By the end, participants should have a richer understanding of the nuances and challenges of translating across different mediums.
