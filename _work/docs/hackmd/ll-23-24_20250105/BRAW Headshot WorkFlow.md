## What is a BRAW file? What does that mean?
Braw stands for "Blackmagic Raw". Blackmagic is the brand of camera and raw means the file is uncompressed. In other words Braw is Blackmagic's codec for compressing footage. A codec, as defined by Oxford's Languages is, "a device or program that compresses data to enable faster transmission and decompresses received data." If you want to know more about Braw files and Blackmagic feel free to visit their [website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicraw#:~:text=Blackmagic%20RAW%20is%20a%20revolutionary,the%20benefits%20of%20RAW%20recording.) for more information. 

### Why do we not always use uncompressed files?
A lot of the time people use compressed footage because raw footage can take up a lot of space very quickly, especially depending on the quality of footage (ex: 1080p, 4k, etc). You should always consider what you're shooting, how long you're shooting, and how much storage space you have available when doing any sort of video project. 

In terms of headshots, since we want sharp, beautiful images at the highest quality and we are shooting video in short bursts, Braw is the way to go. 

## What makes a good headshot? How should I frame it?



## How do I shoot Braw?

Standing behind the camera, there should be two USB-C ports on the top lefthand side of the camera body. You can plug an sdx drive right into those ports!

After doing so, you will be able to press the small gray button at the bottom of the screen. If you are recording the button should turn red.

Once you're done recording, hit the red button and it should turn gray. Then you are free to pull out the drive.

##  How do I get my files?

Your files will look like this:

You can open them and edit them in Davinci Resolve, Blackmagic's video editor.
