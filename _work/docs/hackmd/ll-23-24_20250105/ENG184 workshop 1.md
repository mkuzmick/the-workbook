## Setting and Tools:
- **The Learning Lab Features:**
  - Several stations with various tools:
    - Three projector zones: One vertical and two horizontal on a table.
    - Computer-only zones.
    - Art supply zones.
    - Printing capabilities (but no projectors connected to these).

## Activity Instructions:
1. **Pair Up:** Participants will pair up, possibly forming a group of three depending on the number.
2. **Theme Selection:** Each pair will select a theme from words or phrases provided in the middle of a large table. These themes relate to the mapping assignment. Themes include (but aren't limited to): gender, religion, time of day, species, desire, mode of transport.
3. **Mapping Objective:** Understand how a place (Cambridge, Massachusetts) can be perceived differently based on the chosen theme.
4. **Brainstorming:** Using note cards, pairs brainstorm elements of a map to represent their theme in Cambridge.
    - Each idea is written on a separate note card for visualization purposes.
5. **Time Frame:** Participants have five minutes to brainstorm. The entire room is available for use.
6. **Support:** The instructor is present for assistance, clarifications, and feedback.

## Additional Context:
- The Learning Lab has an explorative atmosphere with both the instructor and a person named Marlon assisting.
- Initial familiarization is provided to ensure participants are comfortable.
- There was potential confusion in finding the Learning Lab location based on side conversations.

The group presented two maps. The first map displays all the active construction sites in Cambridge. The second, albeit incomplete, map showcases income distribution in Cambridge. Additionally, a computer screen displayed poverty rates throughout Cambridge, highlighting areas with the densest populations living in poverty. The group pointed out a noticeable trend: the census tracts in Cambridge with the highest poverty or lowest income rates also have many active construction sites. This observation suggests ongoing development and potential gentrification in those areas. The group received commendation for how the two maps complemented each other. They will present the final map on Discord.
