## text to image

Text to Image is Canva's answer to generative AI tools like DALL·E 2 and Midjourney, which generate images based on natural text prompts. Simply describe the image you want to see, and Canva will attempt to create it.

Of course, the quality of your results will vary based on the prompts you use. Typically, the more details you provide, the better—especially when it comes to describing your image's style. Stuck on what kind of style you want? Canva also offers one-click styles, like Photo, Neon, Minimalist, Watercolor, Retro Anime, and Dreamlike.

## magic eraser

Tweaking photos to remove unwanted objects has historically consumed a huge percentage of designers' time. That's why Magic Eraser is an absolute life-saver. It edits, in seconds, what might take designers half an hour or more to do.

Here's how you can instantly clean up your photos using Canva's Magic Eraser:

Select the objects you want to remove from your image, and then click on the Magic Eraser tool. Next, "paint" over your unwanted objects, and let Magic Eraser get to scrubbing.

## magic edit


Magic Edit is the graphic design tool you never knew you needed. With one click and a few words, you can turn one object into another—a bit like a Harry Potter spell.

Take the vanilla birthday cake in the Before image below. I simply highlighted the cake, and then described what I wanted Canva to replace the cake with. In this case, I prompted Canva to change the vanilla cake to a chocolate cake with candles. Presto, change-o!

## magic write

There are dozens of AI writing tools. But until now, transferring their output into Canva involved lots of copying and pasting.

Magic Write is an AI text generator built directly into Canva, making it easier to generate long- or short-form written content for your social media posts, blog articles, and presentations.

## magic design

In the past, creating designs in Canva meant combing through their impressive but overwhelming library of design templates, and then customizing them to match your images, logo, and overall aesthetic. Now, Canva's Magic Design uses AI to flip that formula around, so you can start designing with a nearly-finished product. Simply upload a photo or enter a text query that describes what you need, and Magic Design will generate relevant design templates to match. No more building from scratch.

## presentations

Instant Presentations is a Magic Design feature that lets you generate entire presentations from a single text prompt.

That's right—no more rushing to finish your presentation the night before your big meeting. In a last-minute "dog ate my homework" scenario, you could theoretically generate a simple presentation at 8:59 a.m., and present it, literally, a minute later.

It's worth mentioning that Canva can't generate a full-fledged presentation for you—at least not yet. But it'll take care of the design and your first draft, meaning all you have to do is fill in the gaps with a few extra details (and maybe a few more slides).

## beat sync

When you watch well-produced Instagram Reels or TikTok videos with audio, you'll notice that the visuals tend to correspond with its accompanying beats. Why? Because viewers are more likely to stay engaged when the visuals match the beat. 

Here's the problem: syncing the beat is a tedious process (just ask your 15-year-old cousin). It involves manually tweaking the timing of multiple audio and video clips over and over again.

Beat Sync uses AI to take the pain out of this process while producing a professionally polished end product. With this feature, even amateur creators can "harmonize" their videos in seconds.
