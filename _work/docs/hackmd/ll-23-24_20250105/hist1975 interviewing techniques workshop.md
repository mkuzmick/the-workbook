## flow
### option 1 [from 20240205 standup]
* Part 1 - How to build rapport, ask questions, we’ll put people in the classroom or small studio and pipe the feed out into the studio
* Part 2 - Then tips about techniques of recording and how and why you might use a more professional set up
* Part 3 - split up, some will record professionally, some on their phones. And then switch
**& Some moment when we look at stuff**
### option 2 [from consultation]
-   First hour - show different technical things having to do with audio capture   
-   Then we set up the activity where they interview each other  
-   Volunteers can go in to small studio and interview  
-   Everyone can hear  
-   Katie can lead a discussion on rapport building and feedback etc  
-   And then everyone can go and do that
-   And then everyone can share their experiences by hitting play on their recordings 
-   And then wrap up with resources etc.



## details to touch on
Re: recording tips
-   Some audio that needs to be understandable for just using a transcript  
    -   Katie would like us to address some of the options for transcription and AI, what are the pros and cons, how do we get better quality transcription, etc.
-   Some audio that needs to be of a presentational quality, and that’s where you need to hit another bar
    -   And in these cases, you might want to apply for funding if you wanted to do this at scale
   
Re: stations
-   We could have a professional podcast set up with headphones so they can hear from each other
-   Different station where they could record on their phones 
-   Editing tools for making a podcast and cleaning up audio ?
