            prompt used: "peering into a cathedral made of words and language"
            
## description

Using an AI tool to test their knowlege, students might use the conversational or tutor-like capacities of chatGPT to ask questions that can help them clarify and thus deepen their knowledge of a language they're learning. Because chatGPT is inexhaustable in its ability to answer questions, students can use this tool as a means of gaining foundational grammatical understanding, asking follow-up questions about unfamiliar terminology and syntactical constructions, and even ask chatGPT to point them to possible topics which they could then research to understand the language in context. 

Depending on the course goals, this type of engagement with AI might give students too much information or it could provide too literal of results to really capture the nuances of the language. You might want to set guidelines for appropriate or inappropriate use. 

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4.
    *  We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

4. Ask the model to help you understand a particular phrase, including multiple ways of understanding a specific term in that phrase (this exercise is useful for students who are exploring the different connotations of a single word)

6. Ask the model to roleplay a character in a certain language. 
    * for example: 
        * A flight attendant who is a Spanish speaker giving you instructions.
        * A bakery owner in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris asking for your order.
        * An ancient monk who whispers in Latin. 
        * A Venetian scholar from the 1920s who lives on the Isle San Lazzaro and studies Aramaic.

7. Prompt chatGPT to converse with you in this "character." Then, add a second instruction, to give two answers each time. One answer, in character. The other, critiquing your dialogue and giving you tips.

7. Converse to practice your langauge skills.

## transcript of activity example:
* USER: 
    * I am a new student to Latin. Could you translate and then explain the phrase: "Astra inclinant, sed non obligant." Could you also demonstrate the multiple ways of understanding each word or the phrase as a whole?
* AI:
    * Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you understand this Latin phrase. "Astra inclinant, sed non obligant" translates to "The stars incline us, they do not bind us" in English.
        * Let's break it down:
            * "Astra" is the plural form of "astrum," which means "star" or "constellation." In a metaphorical sense, it can also refer to "heaven" or "sky."
            * "Inclinant" is the third-person plural present indicative active form of "inclinare," which means "to incline," "to lean," or "to bend." In a metaphorical sense, it can mean "to influence" or "to predispose."
            * "Sed" is a conjunction that means "but."
            * "Non" is an adverb that means "not."
            * "Obligant" is the third-person plural present indicative active form of "obligare," which means "to bind," "to oblige," or "to compel."
        
        So, the literal translation would be "The stars incline, but do not bind." This phrase is often interpreted as meaning that while the stars (or fate, destiny, etc.) may influence or guide us, they do not determine our actions or decisionsâ€”we have free will.
* USER: 
    * Thank you. Now, I would like to practice a language with you. For this exercise, you will be roleplaying as an ancient monk who whispers in medieval, continental Latin. Please structure each answer you give in the following way:
        * First, respond to whatever I say in accurate Latin. Do not hallucinate.
        * Two, in a second section, respond to me in English. Please use this section to critique my Latin and give me tips.

        Let's start: Salve, quomodo vales hodie? Quid facietis?
        
* AI:
    1. Salve, fili. Bene valeo, gratias tibi ago. Hodie, orationem meditabor.
    2. Your Latin is quite good! You correctly used the greeting "Salve, quomodo vales hodie?" (Hello, how are you today?). However, "Quid facietis?" is a bit off. You used the future tense "facietis" (you all will do) when you probably meant to use the present tense "facitis" (you all do). So, the correct question would be "Quid facitis?" (What are you all doing?). Keep practicing, you're doing well!

* USER: 
    * Oro te? Possemus etiam cantare.
* AI:
    1. Certe, fili. Cantemus.
    2. Your Latin is improving! You correctly said "Oro te?" (Can I ask you?) and "Possemus etiam cantare" (Could we also sing?). Just a small note: "Oro te" is more commonly used to mean "I beg you" or "I pray you". If you want to say "Can I ask you?", you might want to use "Possum te interrogare?" instead. But overall, good job!
