My essay seeks to answer the question: Can rap therapy benefit young people? One article I reference discusses the critiques around rap and hip-hop culture, asserting its potential detrimental effects on the youth due to its deep-rooted influence on aspects like fashion, speech, and behavior. Conversely, David A. Ross's "Adolescent Wellbeing" establishes a clear definition for well-being, both subjective and objective. I'll use this as a metric to determine if rap therapy aligns with or promotes this concept of well-being in adolescents.

The critical article on rap also offers historical insights, explaining why certain perceptions around rap and hip-hop have formed and the implications on adolescent mindfulness. It further shares experiences of therapists who incorporated rap therapy, outlining successes and challenges. Michael Thot's work adds another layer, showing how music therapy assists in cognitive rehabilitation following traumatic brain incidents. This illustrates the broader power of music to improve daily mental challenges and well-being.

I also highlight a SoundCloud track, "The Mindfulness Life Project Hip-Hop," which creatively adapts popular rap songs to promote positivity and well-being. Lastly, a J. Cole interview is incorporated to exemplify the intersection of music therapy and mindfulness techniques. J. Cole discusses the importance of integrating mindfulness practices, like breathing exercises, into his musical process.

In essence, my essay aspires to bridge the gap between rap therapy and mindfulness, advocating for a comprehensive approach to enhance youth well-being.
