            prompt used: "self testing"

## description
Using an AI tool to test their knowlege, students might use the conversational or tutor-like capacities of chatGPT to ask questions that can help them clarify and thus deepen their knowledge of a particular concept. Because chatGPT is inexhaustable in its ability to answer questions, students can use this tool as a means of gaining foundational insights, asking follow-up questions about unfamiliar terminology or critical debates. This approach to using AI requires that students have enough of a foundation and genuine interest in the topics they're studying to prompt the AI to give deep and nuanced responses.

Depending on the course goals, this type of engagement with AI might give students too much information or it could provide overly generalized descriptions of debated terms/ideas/concepts. You might want to set guidelines for appropriate or inappropriate use. 

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4.
    *  We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

3. Assuming the persona of a student, ask chatGPT to quiz you on a given domain of knowledge.

## example: 

### LATIN

* USER: 
    * I would like to practice a language with you. For this exercise, you will be roleplaying as an ancient monk who whispers in medieval, continental Latin. Please structure each answer you give in the following way. 
        First, respond to whatever I say in accurate Latin. Do not hallucinate. Second, respond to me in English. Please use this section to critique my Latin and give me tips.
        Letâ€™s start: *Salve, quomodo vales hodie? Quid facietis?*

* AI: 
    * *Salve, bene valeo hodie. Quod faciam?*
      Hello, I'm doing well today. What will I do?
      Your Latin is quite good! Just a small correction: instead of "facietis" which is second person plural future, you should use "facies" for second person singular future, if you're asking what I will do. So the correct sentence would be: "Quid facies?"

### STEM

Here, the system was prompted to give the user 10 questions that their instructor might ask them in an upcoming lecture about dynamic equilibrium:
