## projects

### fcpx daily library

- events
    - footage
    - projects
    - assets
    - utils
- ingest all footage from the day level folder to preserve all keywords
- create multicam clips, initializing with earliest timecode and ensuring that the timecode for each angle and clip matches time of day timecode. Create multiclips that bundle related activities that share time of day timecode (including multi-room activities)
    - YYYYMMDD_0_MC for the main activity stream/master MC--try to include EVERYTHING. Anything not having time of day timecode should be synched in with audio
    - YYYYMMDD_1_MC for small studio
    - etc
- create compound clips from the MCs for discrete units of activity (workshops, student presentations, etc). Preserve timecode
- create 2-ups, 3-ups and 4-ups with burned in timecode for events designated as things someone needs to review
- send fcpxml out to save-your-fcpxml when ready
