# lluf-prompts-for-20240305


## AI-Assisted Paper Pixel Art

**work-sharing-channel:** #ll-work-code
**prereqs:** experience with code or art projects in the LL
**prompt:** We'll be generating many many images matching the Pantone colors and we want to work towards some installations that tile these. We want to prototype two options: 
1. pixel art between 8x8 and 48x96.
2. munsell-color charts or simple color gradients

We will generate images in DallE, but to make sure that the colors are perfect, we will postprocess with opencv or imagemagick or ffmpeg or anything else you can think of. It's fine to prototype post-processing in Ps or other app--we'll just need to do it with code when we scale up the process.

If you are interested in this one, come talk to Marlon--there are many options for next steps that we'll break down into separate tasks down the line:

- py image processing
- pitching pixel art
- physical prototypes

**specs and tools**: opencv, imagemagick, ffmpeg, python, nodejs
