## description
* Generic description: 
    * "Tome launched a free product similar to Powerpoint, but with features that make it easier to create presentations on mobile and to add a range of visuals, from tweets to videos, into slides. Tome integrated generative AI — software trained to produce text, images, and other content on demand — into the product. This gave users the ability to use research firm OpenAI’s GPT-3 model and DALL-E 2 tool to quickly and easily generate original text and images, respectively, for their presentations without leaving the Tome platform.
