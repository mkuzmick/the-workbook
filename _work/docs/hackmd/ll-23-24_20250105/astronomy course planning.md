# astronomy course planning

## ideas
* using telescope to see large-scale objects
    * galaxies?
* plot image from James Webb data related to large-scale things
* connecting all of this to colab
* connecting blender to colab
    * not sure if this would be something students would do?
* what's necessary in the assignment
    * need them to understand at a conceptual level (not necessarily in the physics)
    * science journalist's ability to articulate what's happening (rather than the math)
* not just about the thing you see but reflecting on the nature of observation
    * comparing and contrasting that to other ways of capturing data (like gravitational wave detector)
* linking what they observe to making the image and comparing those processes together
* shorter instances of explanation worked in
    * tiktok or instagram-size insight
    * chunking it so students can understand and undertake a capstone
* some kind of oral/visual presentation that gives them experience of performing that would be important to the capstone
    * need for metaphors when you're talking about something beyond human scale - coming up with analogies that help people grasp it and gain intuition of it
    * how to represent something that happened temporally or at some huge distance from us - these puzzles that are core to astronomy
    * things that are tough to visualize or that are tough to grasp but that visualize would help it make sense to students

## to do
* alexia pitch the idea of doing rapid protoyoping to edo and allyson next week. get their ok on 4-5 short things. 
* alexia ask edo for a single bullet point for what he wants to talk about during a particular class
    * get some kind of list from him so alexia knows the content
    * even if we just get one class's content and can work on that
    * and imagine 5 different assignments that could align with that class for that week
* then, if she gets the okay, alexia tries making some of these things to see how long it takes and get feedback from edo
    * short micro assignments/things a student could do in 2 hours and then students do them over the term and remix a few of them for their final project 
        * maybe blender animation
        * science explainer video
        * unpack a journalistic piece about a scientific article (what science in the news is about)
        * etc.
* get Webb telescope data and connecting it to blender or some visualization tool
    * using python/notebook
