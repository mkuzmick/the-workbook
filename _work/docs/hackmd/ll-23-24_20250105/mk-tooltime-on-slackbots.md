# mk-tooltime-on-slackbots

- need a repo
- may as well have the thing built out
- then much of tutorial is just connecting to a new slack space
- or should I create 7-8 apps with credentials and permissions?
    - or get someone to do this in the am?
    - or lead them through it?
    - (if app manifest.json then not so hard?)
- have a template they can fork
-
