# AFVSDEPT-Website Development-Protoype

### Writing Task Description and Notes

### Context


The four goals of this website are to: create an online virtual gallery for students to exhbit and show work; to provide a platform for engaging student led curation; to engage recently graduated students and alumni of AFVS; to automate an archive of AFVS student work (as well as to post past archives).


### Deliverables
List the deliverables expected.

The above goals will all be realized through the creation of a "virtual exhibition" and an "online open studio." The virtual exhibition will be a curated element of the site whereas the online open studio will a place for all students to post their work. 

An website will have seven "tabs": 

1) AFVS Online Exhibitons: this tab will be the "face/landing page" for the site. Here one graduate student + one undergraduate student will curate an end of the semester vitual show to coincide with the department's open studios. The necessary funding for two such positions will need to be procured, but the project of curation could also be folded into a class on curation, such as the class Dan Byers (CCVA curator) teaches now. This aspect of the virtual gallery builds upon a previous desire for a brick and mortar gallery in Sever Hall. It could also connect with future plans for AFVS's Seattle St. building (coming Fall 2024).

2) Open Galleries Student Work: Here students would be able submit a form and post their own work. This page could be subdivided into classes and would be a space for open browsing. The submission form is key to this part of the site. Through such a form students would opt in various degrees of AFVS engagement. They could opt to recieve emails from AFVS for the remainder of their undergrad as well as opt to be engaged as alumni when they graduate. They could choose to have their work remain active on the site for varying amounts of time. Here is were permissions will be important. The central component of this part of the site will be the student form that allows students to post their work.  

3) Graduate Student Projects: This would be another form controlled section of the site. Graduate students would similarly opt into engagement with the department by posting projects or texts to the site. This could be given a different name and seen as a sort of graduate student online journal or blog.

4) Alumni Engagement: This section of the site would lead to the landing page already in use by AFVS (or the one be developed as Harvard changes hosting platforms) which requires Harvard credentials. I have to work with Spinney to figure out how we can make this more interactive with what we already have. But, the main goal is for the rest of the forms (ie the open studios form and the graduate form) to lead to signing up for the alumni site. There could also be an element that allows for posting alumni projects or visits. There is already an alumni and faculty screening series that could be posted here for example. In other words, most if not all of the automations for the website will have to do with engaging alumni and current students to a part of our alum network.  

4) The AFVS Archive: All pages one posted for a certain amount of time will be cataloged into the archive. The archive will also contain pages that host histories of AFVS, showcasing previous archives. 

5) Workshops and Resources for Virtual Documentation: The main project of the MDF for AFVS will be to maintain this website, guide students through virtually documenting their work, and to host workshops on the translation between digital and analog (material) aesthetics. Depending on the MDF these workshops will vary. 

6) Contact: Here the MDF, Pedagogy Fellow and potential curatorial fellows will be have their information, as well as other department admins. There will also be a form to sign up for notifications about AFVS happenings and visitors. 

This prototype will include what each of these tabs needs to be maintained, as well as what each needs in terms of permissions/access.
