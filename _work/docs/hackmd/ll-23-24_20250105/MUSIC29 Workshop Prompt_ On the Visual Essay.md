# MUSIC29 Workshop Prompt: On the Visual Essay

## Background
For the upcoming [MUSIC 29: Black Protest Music](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/121885)'s Visual Essay Workshop, the students will bring in a piece of music. We'll get them to brainstorm what they could create as visuals, and then do a practice live video podcast, where they pitch their final project proposal (which is due 2 days after the workshop). To support this, we'll have instruments set up around the space, playlists that the students are listening to for class cued up, and images printed and videos playing around the space. In addition, wed like to have some alternate ways of visualizing structures of music and features of music, that the students can use to make an interpretive argument.

For their final project, students can either 1) choose to submit an essay analyzing a Black protest musical work, 2) produce a 5-10 minute video that critically analyzes music and/or an artist not already intensely studied in the course; or 3) compose and produce a Black protest musical work and short essay. So the workshop should feel valuable to ALL of the students, even those who choose option 1.

The workshop flow will likely be:
* some type of icebreaker (album cover mechanic)
* unpacking a video essay
* time for the students to develop their pitches using art supplies, etc.
* time for the students to pitch
* time for the students to get feedback on their pitches and visuals

## Ask
We'll likely run this workshop as a conventional unpacking-a-video-essay activity but we’d like to add some additional elements into the mix that would be particularly useful in crafting a visual essays about music. 

SO we're looking for ideas on **alternate ways of visualizing structures and features of music** that students can use while brainstorming and pitching, and also things to just have around the space (ie. cool 3d visualizations that can be displayed on screens, though this might not be an activity for them to do themselves, as they would with paper cut outs). These ideas can be inspired by the video essays below, but your own ideas are also awesome.


**Music-related video essay examples:**

### Deliverable
Your ideas - either pitched to us verbally (during a meeting TBD), or via slack (plain text messages, hackMD links, or video pitch).
