# 20240409-game-jam-planning

nice to have a starter project that the LL can maintain. nice to for us take as much control over it as we can (we don't need to build a whole bunch of new things, but at least simplify, and poke around in the code to make sure we understand)

as far as a sample scene, we might need to check in with them

dd will check in with them about
* which starter scenes they like the most from the unity starter pack
* if they have a prompt, and any other details (dialogue?)
* siriana asked: who is attending this event, and what will they want to have accomplished by the end of the event

(if they decide on a scene, then siriana can work on a simplified project)

worst case scenario - we can use a template

siriana requests handheld citrus, pastries, dunkin coffee

## flow
