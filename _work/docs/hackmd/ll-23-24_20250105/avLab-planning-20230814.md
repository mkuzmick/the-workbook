### the plan

- what is avLab? 

Disseminating information using both aural and visual means is called “audio-visual communication.” It is utilized in various media, such as live performances, computer-generated imagery, radio, and television. An AV project would include a combination of text, images, motion, and audio. 

Understanding the power of using audio and visual media simultaneously lies in human psychology and the biology of the human nervous system. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning suggests there are two different channels humans use to process information – auditory and visual. Each channel works independently, and each is limited in how much information it processes. Many philosophers practice an “audiovisual litany,” which is a conceptual gesture that favorably opposes sound and sonic phenomena to a supposedly occularcentric status quo. Audiovisual litany “assumes that sound draws us into the world while vision separates us from it. However, recent sound studies theory argue that all senses are tethered, and we cannot separate them (Sterne).

		- presentations
		- broadcasting
		- web design
		- social media 
		- projections
		- installations
		- performance
- watch a video 
	- break down all the different parts of the video
- what are the roles of each element, what do they achieve, depending on how they're used
- how montage plays into this bigger picture
- list out and overview the elements 
	- list out all the materials used
		- found footage
		- graphics/illustrations
		- talking head/narration
		- sound vs music
		- b-roll
		- crafted vs captured
			- how would you reduce subjectivity?
	- use working files as the visual demonstrations
