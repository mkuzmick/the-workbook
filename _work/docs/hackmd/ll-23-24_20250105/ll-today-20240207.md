## capture and processing

### capture

- juhee 
    - overhead 4K (through A4K is easiest?) 
    - a couple 70-200s recording 4K internally too, one obviously the LL, one less so. MCUs CUs and XCUx of Juhee, her hands, the test, etc. Maybe a macro even.
    - a couple quick establishing shots from back corner showing what's happening. (can be done on rolling c200 internally with 16-35 and 24-70 combo before swapping in 100mm macro or 70-200)
- pod challenge 
    - ME1 = comp of 60mm shot with flying key of the main stage on top
    - ME2 = clean 60mm
    - ME3 = clean 18mm
    - ME4 = clean stage/overhead? (whatever we did last time, then let's log this here) 
    - optional additional 70-200 on LLUFs if we already have them out, but these can be in 1080 on hyperdecks
