# SOTS 20230920
## messy notes
* secret codeLab for printing 
    * once we have everything in markdown, print-this next app
* for task level things, we can get AI to help us fill out descriptions
* for projects, dd interviews mk explaining a project, then get AI's help 
## figure out the fields we want to focus on populating
### required
title
description
image
tags
### optional
add fields here
### references
* if there's a view that shows only require fields, we can start with filling that in
* [open graph data and metatags](https://ahrefs.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/)
## resources
* get all into airtable
* have a tagging system
* also go through older resources in google or other forms (like podcasting.learninglab.xyz, and get them into markdown
* (need a gameplan for getting these into markdown )
