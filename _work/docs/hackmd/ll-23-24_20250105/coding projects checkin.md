# 20230928 coding projects check-in

what comes next, where theyâ€™re at, what they can help with over the next few months


## messy notes
* making sure we're supporting the people that are learning by making sure they're learning accurate things
* what do anna and christine want to do after the ILP? (and what do they want other people to be doing after?)
    * projects that codelab can be connected to
        * gened1001
        * things at the intersection of other labs
            * sophie working on website for 3js 
            * unity and unreal
            * secret-ai stuff
        * mk doing core event lab stuff, but thinking of things that connect to the studio
        * fellows timelines / reports etc.
        * video games zone? (getting live data from people and visualizing)
        * live visualizations with OBS and image generation
        * connecting to Scalar and Canvas APIs
* good to think about a collection of people making components to use together, instead of each person sinking all of their time working on one app
* brainstorm ways of using to help with inputs (people talking, doing things on camera/under overhead) - think about what outputs we can do with code
