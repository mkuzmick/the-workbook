## Setting up your workspace

Premiere Pro is a non-destructive editor. This essentially means that you're manipulating clips that are existing files, referenced from within your hard drive, and when you export the film, it's creating copies of your work. So, naturally, whenever you're working in a system that references files, you should keep meticulous care to organize your work. 

There are two levels of organization to start with, where you keep your files, and how you see them show up in Premiere's file manager. 

I highly recommend that you maintain a structured set of folders that allow you to track this information independently of Premiere's organizational system. This will make it so that if your hard drive is disconnected, or you move from computer to computer, you can easily make it back to all those referenced files. 

We most commonly organize our footage by the date and time it was shot. But that's not the perfect solution for everyone. So think about what information is valuable, and go from there. 

Once you have all your footage and assets in one single location, you can feel free to import them into Premiere. 
- This can be done using File > Import > Media
- Or, you can simply drag them from your file system into the app's file manager. 

Once in your Bin, you have the ability to add additional Folders, and rename your footage once again -- these changes will NOT effect the original files, so this is a way of freely annotating your footage without damaging future reference links. 

## The Nuts and Bolts

Once you have footage in the editor, you can finally start doing the core functions of editing. This is done dominently in the Sequence pane -- this is the timeline in which you'll assemble your edit. 

Start with double clicking your footage in your Project pane, this will show in the Source window -- this will always show your original footage. 

Play your footage back, and when you find the START of a clip you'd like to start assembling with, press "I" on your keyboard, this will set your In Point. Next, play the video and when you reach the point you want your clip to stop, hit "O" on your keyboard. This will set your Out Point. 

Finally, to start adding these to your timeline, press your "comma" key. This will Insert your clip into your timline. It's important to note that it will end up wherever your timeline
