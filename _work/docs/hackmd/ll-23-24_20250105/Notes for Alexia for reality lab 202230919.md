# Notes for Alexia for reality lab 202230919

Hey Alexia! I started trying some things out to get the tourus cloud we were trying to make last week. 

This is what I came up with.

## Here are the videos I used to get to this point:

[How to make clouds!](https://youtu.be/AUMnb0UYE5g?feature=shared)

[How to make things glow!](https://youtu.be/ck3x6yzl2uA?feature=shared)

[How to save composited images!](https://youtu.be/napMtY5Tyx8?feature=shared)

## Shading

I used the shading tab to create the clouds from a tourus:

I did stray away slightly from the tutorial using a **Color Ramp** node instead of a Principled Volume node like the tutorial uses. 

## Compositing

To make the sphere glow I used the compositing tab:

I did it exactly the same as the tutorial for making things glow above.

## Rendering

Rendering composited images requires different steps to render it so I included a tutorial on how to do so in the list of videos I included.
