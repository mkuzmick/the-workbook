# complit 208x planning

## things we have
* [complit280x resource](https://hackmd.io/TOu9mEm1Q_meNYcxAlkIMA)

## notes
* we're helping with web part
* students have lots of poems
* ask was for us to help them think about putting this up on public platforms in ways other than python notebooks
* sliding scale of options
    * python notebooks
    * to published poems - either printed or on the web
* javascript
    * thinking only about css files
    * but also could do it in react because that's what everyone does
    * on up to something interactive within it because idea is that these are poem generators (click a button and get another poem, random poem generates each time you go to the page)
* can allude to fact that databases are a thing but maybe there's a big JSON object with an array of poems
* google folder of poems for colab
* adding interaction 
* docusaurus

## to do
* dani share colabs we have
* ask dd and mw to ask LLUFs to help
    * gonzalo
    * GAICAs who are familiar with Next
* pull together a bunch of codeLab stuff
* create resource doc
    * helps people understand the array of tools they might use to make a simple poetry site
* find some models
* each of us make a sample or two to show
    * really focused on making it look cool!


## the plan
* walk through resource doc
* stations where they can dive into something specific
