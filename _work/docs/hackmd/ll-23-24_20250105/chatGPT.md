## description
* Generic description: 
    * ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 foundational large language models and has been fine-tuned using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. It's API is the base of most other AI tools.

## prompting tips

* [“Learn Prompting”](https://learnprompting.org/)
    * There are a few different parts of a prompt that you will see over and over again. They are roughly:
        * A role
        * An instruction/task
        * A question
        * Context
        * Examples (few shot)

## pedagogical use-case 

* Max: 
  * can be very useful in a conversational context
  * When studying for cumulative exams, especially in the humanities, that involve many varying texts it can be used to remember general arguments for texts that everyone is supposed to know and build off of
  * When used to summarize parts of books, cite small parts of texts, and recall general arguments the onus to synthesize this information is still on the student, they just have assistance in basic recalling of information which cuts out a lot of the time spent searching for this info which is already available on the internet and allows for further synthesis and evaluation of ideas and arguments
    * All of the ideas provided by GPT still have to be thought about and evaluated because most often they are too basic for the level of complexity required by a course, so it provides an important service in presenting simple arguments which then must be evaluated, synthesized, and then either expanded upon or rejected by the student
    * Students are all already using resources like sparknotes to study for cumulative humanities exams, and this just simplifies the process of getting these summaries and allows the student to talk back to the source and engage in conversation, therefore requiring active studying and synthesis of the information instead of just reading and memorizing plot points
      * In summary, when used ethically and actively as a tool, chatGPT is extremely useful in allowing the student to actively engage with a resource that can summarize texts and present general arguments. This provides a space for active synthesis, evaluation, and engagement with the information instead of simple, passive memorization of plot points, which traditional summarization resources like Sparknotes encourage.
