# EMR133-Podcasting Content and Structure Resource-Resource

## Resource and Notes

### Context
resource on structure as well as content of the segments. what sorts of things could comprise parts of a podcast where there is time to fill (the assignment i think is a 10-15 min long podcast?)

for reference, [our most recent consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQYj5ZlDUjOHd32JUJ9LH1-yzsOLeX3QlbrY-xA4qhQ/edit#heading=h.9n8xrrhik9x5) from before the workshop (and previous consultation notes are linked there). marlon will have more information about this as they spoke after the workshop about this.


### Deliverables
a resource to send back!
