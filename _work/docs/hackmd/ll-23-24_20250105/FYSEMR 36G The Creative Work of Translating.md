# FYSEMR 36G The Creative Work of Translating

Students in The Creative Work of Translating look at different types of translation, as well as the different ways that translation happens. During the week when students were examining translation across media, they came to the Learning Lab for a workshop about using different media to translate–from text to the voice, from the voice to the body, from text and voice to image, from moving to still image. Students rotated through stations that allowed them to practice these types of translations. By the end of the sesion, students had made their own translations of the same texts, culminating in a collaborative, layered translation, with students’ voices, musical compositions, gestures, and images integrating into a group translation of the text. Students also had the opporunity to try out some ideas for their final projects and to get feedback on those ideas.
