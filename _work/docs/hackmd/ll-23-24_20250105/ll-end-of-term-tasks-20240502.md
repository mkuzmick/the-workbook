### mythic eclipse renders

Steps:

1. export 48 separate well-focused well-framed shots of the sun from 20240408. Ideally these will be exactly sampled at perfect intervals covering the entire eclipse (we may have to cheat for some though)
2. test sd with different cropping choices on some sample shots. In some we want the sphere to be horizontally and vertically centered, at least 50% the height of the frame. In others let's position it in a corner, smaller, and see if we can fill the frame with additional elements. **Send your output to Slack for feedback before moving on to step 3.**
3. for the desired crop size (confirm with Dani) create the final 48 references shots, with the sun precisely the same size in each and perfectly centered in each (or in the identical spot in each if composition=asymmetrical)
4. use each of the 48 as a controlnet layer in a comp, then create a 2 second gif (and maybe another with shots held for multiple frames or with dissolves as a test)
5. create a color gradient across the shots at small scale and print for installation.

### end of year show and tells

Steps:

1. find some media associated with the things you did/made this year and load up your channel (or a hackmd) with them
2. during your next pod-time, walk your team-mates through what you've done this year, showing the media as you go.
