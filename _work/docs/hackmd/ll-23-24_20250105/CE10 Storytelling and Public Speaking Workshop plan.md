## potential demos and set pieces
* intro: something about narrative, steve jobs thing live or pitch deck strucutures-story structures-overload them with story sturctures (vonnegut, hollywood trajectories),
* BMC to cards: cut canvas up OR write it on cards - to get all of the potential pieces of their narrative onto the cards 
    1. cut up, transcribe pieces of BMC to cards & write names on cards to put next to the set pieces that you will claim
    2. try out a structure, an order. then switch up who says what.
    3. then keep the order of speakers, but switch up the order of set pieces

* create a podcast-y close up zone
* JK or SL do campy versions of the steve jobs pitch (as a quick tour of the stations, but also to show the strengths and weaknesses and etc. of the different stations)
## prep
* have lots of examples of pitch decks and hollywood plots (as part of tablescapes)
* print business model canvases
    * 11x17 for ones that are in the actual structure
    * 8.5x11 is fine for others
* four tables that can seat 8 people
    * art materials at each table (8 scissors at each, etc)
    * maybe have the confidence monitor and recording
    * 
* roving camera 
* room for them to do like a big circle
* environment zones-
    * stage
    * small studio
    * elevator/hallway
    * close up zone
