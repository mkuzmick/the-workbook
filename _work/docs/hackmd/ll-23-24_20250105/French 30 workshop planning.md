# French 30 workshop planning

## plan: 75 mins
* welcome (5 mins)
* serial unpacking, fresh air boeing ep (20 mins)
    * narrative

* two stations (each 20-30 mins)
    * interviewing and mic taste test
        * 1 group starts with mic taste test - write one adjective on a card for each mic, reflect after each mic
        * 1 group starts with interviewing using pod mics and live podcast cam setup
        * switch
    * garageband/editing
* [resource to share with course](https://hackmd.io/WCDhaCFMTcGzFnfFrxdhLw?view)

## who is around
* cd
* sophie
* blue
* lara
* laura
* madeleine

## other ideas
* unpacking (15 ins)
* some activity where they all record something + live podcast (20 mins)
    * think of a course topic so far
    * in small groups, try to have an informal convo about it in french
    * someone records on phone
    * then we'll use this for editing
    * if time - we could play back what they recorded to reflect on audio quality
    * or they really make the podcasts on their phones - like one person finds music bed
    * another person records primary data audio/group talking
    * a third person does narration on the stage as these things play back
* then editing using audio they recorded??
