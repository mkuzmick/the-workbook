# ENGLISH184CF-Brainstorming Workshops-research-develop-idea

## Description and Notes

### Context
planning for the 4 workshops on
* Wednesday, October 11, 1:30-2:30 and 4:30-5:30
* Thursday, October 12, 3-4 and 4:30-5:30
    
### Deliverables
raw material to eventually port over to a finalized [workshop plan](https://hackmd.io/Fh_kiMEGSN-nWgZc7wG2rA?view)!

## messy notes
* 1 hour for each session
* lara will come to the other sections (taught by the other TF)
* lara's initial thoughts
    * tension between giving them materials without closing their options
    * sample base maps - we want
    * but we won't be able to give base maps for every neighborhood they're interested in
    * one option: finding the map is part of the activity
    * then we print those things
* we can project maps
    * then someone draws/outlines them on paper
    * teaches them a mechanic they could use later on
* lara wants them to be able to get hands-on practice with goal of the assignment: the concept of the maps existing between the two maps
    * this is v challenging for students so it's important for them to understand this
* mk other idea:
    * do cambridge instead of london 
    * easier on the prep side
    * thinking about how multiple perspectives of drawing maps tells a different story about it
    * they all have an experience of this space
    * then do the act of comparison between two views of the maps
    * and they see whether the argument works between the two maps
* if the students get an idea that connects to london or mumbai - they can still use it as an idea (lara's idea)
* deploy the major themes but through cambridge
    * inequality
    * access to healthcare
    * etc.
* another idea
    * quick activity with harvard
    * some work time to zero in on individuals in their cities
* another idea
    * majority is cambridge/harvard activity 
    * find neighborhood
    * trace it out
    * quick idea about it
    * present
    * final portion: bit of time to think about your map for either london and mumbai
* we need to emphasize the "and therefore what"
    * this is part of the story that the maps tell
* give them the choice of london, mumbai, cambridge
* activity
    * themes on cards (gender, etc.)
    * pairs choose a theme
    * map this out in two ways on Harvard's campus/Cambridge
    * what are some ways you could represent this differently?
    * quickly on cards think of as many ways as possible of showing this distinction/comparison/etc through two maps
    * then have them reflect
        * on how doable each of these maps are
        * how profound the insight is
        * get some feedback from lara/us
    * then they a get randomly assigned a station to make a quick prototype with arts supplies
        * 2 x stations where they use a projector
        * 2 x stations w/ the pre-printed maps
        * 2 x stations with arts supplies ONLY
        * 2 x stations with computers/digital maps
    * then you need a key where you translate the data/idea/argument into some kind of a visual marker
        * the grammar/rhetoric/key of your map
        * arts supplies
        * can print things if they want us to
        * they can draw
        * have legos and stuff out!
        * how do you make sense with colors, lines, shapes
    * last thing = little presentation with rationale and narrative 
        * say your theme
        * and how the two maps relate to each other 
        * in 30 SECONDS!

## prep
* make the base maps
* make the cards for the themes
* where do we want to put cameras
* arts supply kits at each spots
* anything else we want to buy for this?
* have the switcher ready to fade - get some macros ready for this
    * have someone one there to switch between different maps
