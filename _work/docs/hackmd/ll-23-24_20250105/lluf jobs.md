# lluf jobs 

* [work/jobs airtable](https://airtable.com/app03VUGoG6fSJcT5/tbl5PcEGX8WKcpzx1/viwTQqLgOgQzl915f?blocks=hide)

## for each

- hackmd explaining the basics
- an initial "specific ask" hack md that includes the basics and then a specific set of materials related to something he have to do this week
- a slack channel of form `ll-work-the-name-of-the-job` like `ll-work-sourcing-media` that we invite at least @madeleine @jordan @marlon `@Learning Lab Studio` and @dani to.
- an updated record in the LLUF base containing a link to the template hackmd
- let's ask DD and JK, but maybe there is a table of specifics that gets linked from the main jobs table, in which case the specific hackmd would get linked there.

## high priority channels

(names need to be confirmed)

- `ll-work-card-capture`
- `ll-work-sourcing-media`
- `ll-work-paper-cutting` (how granular do we get? I say not so granular and just have instructions for the various things that get cut---and then the specific ask will call out what that thing is)...or else `ll-work-document-production` for the production of on-paper materials that fall short of `ll-work-paper-engineering`--the latter is for when the paper is object/artifact/artwork rather than the more or less transparent medium for information delivery?
- `ll-work-button-making`
- `ll-work-chalk` (specifics will refer to specific locations)
- `ll-work-paper-engineering` (could this also involve cutting?)
- `ll-work-interviews/reports/updates/pod-meetings` need a name for this, but it gets a channel too @jordan
- `ll-work-maintenance` = cleaning, tidying, vacuuming, sorting, coiling, etc etc etc etc
- `ll-work-photovideo-editing` = stories of an event, of a day, of a week. Still selection, still editing, etc. Some of these will be divided up into subjobs
    - still selection
    - still editing
    - montage editing
        - for the day
        - the week
        - an event
        - a person or project
    - `ll-work-finding-stills` (name up for grabs)
    - `ll-work-processing-stills` (maybe condensed with above????)
- `ll-colab-work`
- `ll-blender-work`
-
