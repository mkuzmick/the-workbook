# ll-work-sourcing-media-hist16d

**Location:** anywhere
**Materials:** a computer, course materials, prompt
**Slack Channel:** `ll-work-sourcing-media`

## steps

1. gather together any resources you can find related to the ask: the syllabus, any notes Dani or Marlon or Madeleine can give you related to the project, etc.
2. post an initial message in #ll-work-sourcing-media (unless the LL team have already done this for you) that indicates you are starting a `sourcing-media-session`. This message should tag your slack id (if you aren't posting as yourself) and should contain the name of the project and any other details specified in the "specifics for this particular ask" section below.
3. find as much media as you can that matches the requirements of the ask and post links in the comments on the original post (along with any notes you have).
4. SOMETIMES
    5. you might be asked to put together a [hackmd lookbook](/XS4tBOhBR7K276tdjSGMEA) from your links
    6. you might be asked to [save the media to the synology](/-ITjQAioS6avxC-aOMOVig) (rather than just sharing the links)
5. when you are done, post a "done" emoji on the original message.


[Here's](https://hackmd.io/zAT7YZkQQOeIPliA3Jtzpg) some extra guidance as well.

## this particular ask

### the core task
We need to find at least one perfect Vox video and one or two perfect pieces of data journalism that are **related to the course's content**.
- data journalism of the sort you might find in The Pudding or The New York Times
- Vox Videos like [the chair video we always show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V10kWLh71U)

### course details

Here is the course description, through you can find more information in the [course canvas site with syllabus](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/133680): 

"From long before the mid-century civil rights revolution through to our current moment of heightened social justice protest, activists have tried to harness the power of their eraâ€™s new and legacy media to achieve their political and social goals. Yet national news media institutions, themselves products of an unequal society with their own industry imperatives, have never been simple tools of US social movements. This seminar will chart major media moments from the early days of television through to the rise of the Twitter era to explore how an evolving US journalism industry has engaged with and represented American dissent."
