## XLS: Extreme Long Shot

Shows the subject(s) and the environment surrounding them from a distance. In our studio this will be accomplished in post.


## LS: Long Shot

Often used interchangeably with Full Shot, but if you distinguish between the two, the long shot would be the wider, containing the entire subject and their environment. Our small studio can barely manage this, and in order to arrive at a useful final product you will want to replace the background.

Could refer to anything between this:

## FS: Full Shot

A shot that contains the subject's entire body. Sometimes used interchangeably with long shot, but if you DO want to make a distinction, the full shot would be tighter--just the full body, while the long shot could sometimes refer to a slightly longer/wider shot that this. Our small studio can barely manage this, and in order to arrive at a useful final product you will want to replace the background.

## MLS: Medium Long Shot

A shot that begins somewhere near the subject's knees, showing just less than the full body.

## Cowboy Shot / American Shot

A shot long enough to show us the subject's hips and thighs (so that we can see their holsters).

## MS: Medium Shot

A shot from the waist or so up.

## CU: Closeup

A shot of the subject's face. Extremely common (and increasingly common over time) to crop top of subject's head.
