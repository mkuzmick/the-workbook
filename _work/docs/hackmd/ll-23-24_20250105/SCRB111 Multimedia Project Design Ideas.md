## messy notes
* re: workshop, mk def wants to "capture + manipulate" -- capture what they do, and manipulation of that (some of it in real time)
    * not supposed to submit any work to student AI
    * would need to be seriously opt in and very obvious what is happening
    * in presentation and framing -- moving from something that's on the table, that's spatial -- need to make it temporal to make sense. folks are building that object up to get to understanding. but we want folks to go off script and them not think about words they're memorizing, more that they know places and they're giving a tour of those places. start accenting this as a mental model during the workshop. 
        * temporal is kind of where you're pulling focus
        * connect to a shell reading - discontinuous space with discreet points, like a nueral network or game board. more like giving a tour of an album collection, what one are you going to pull out next. metaphorically spatial
* what we want to build
    * ways of getting from that mode of understanding and being in the world (knowing stuff) to products. 
    * knowing stuff -> a video. we want to design ways of doing that

* some mechanics
    * recording voices, transcribing, and prompting various AIs with things we've pre-designed to be helpful (so this is a prompt design + coding challenge)
    * cool to let them know in a campy way, if they go into the small studio, that the bot is listening to them. maybe balenciaga-style looping video of "if you walk in this room, i'll be listening to you"
* mechanics we can imagine using
    * recording them and doing things with that text
    * capturing all the visuals they produce and trying to create content with them quickly
    * moving quickly from presentations at the table to something that presents that text together with still images (like a text based essay)
    * storyboarding, and then feeding their content from the day back in storyboard form. kind of like a **storyboarding machine**
        * the 5 clearly different states that the table hit with the notes
    * the idea of having JW's feedback frame a prompt and have that feedback get more granular than jessica does, that could be cool
        * jk and JW say 30 seconds worth of things, and maybe a prompt could turn those 30 seconds into a longer bit of feedback that is sent back to students
* challenges
    * record everything they're doing and then get into airtable
    * wizard of oz position
        * we probably want to have folks doing live stills + key moments (llufs+mpas?)
    * so what they emerge with is a media product that is made, but also a BTS pres
### consultations
* consultations - we'd also want to thicken + document those. record. doing a series of oral drafts that are captured so they can be handed those back. **like an oral drafting machine**
* we'll have to figure out what to do with 20 hours of screen capture, and could we write a script that would make that easier from the technical perspective 
#### last year
* the consultations depended on the group. some groups came pretty early, still deciding on their topic (ideally being in connection with the TF/course folks for that type of thing - unless they're coming in for a session specifically for that maybe with the TF)
* they would talk about what visuals could be used - the visual stream and auditory stream. thinking about that kind of storyboard
* what kind of visuals do you want to make? colors? materials? what's the tone? 
* as they were working, jordan would pop in to see how she could help when passing by. little tips or suggestions or ideas or boosts of visual support
* how to get folks to understand how to use visuals, not just represnting text but representing something that text can't do 
### this year
* JK really likes the idea of the TF being involved in the consultations
* and that that could be part of the machine
* storyboarding consultations (or before that, deciding on the topic) with the TF
* maybe could involve mdfs as well
* the visual consultations would be separate, maybe the TF doesn't need to be there for that
* fine to schedule consultations, but maybe also open work time/open studios
* maybe a library style thing where you can check out materials. or seeing what the libraries and the houses have, if they have art materials the students could access
* we could put together a cheap art pack if we want
* potentially if an mdf was excited about helping, they could host an evening time - maybe a SciComm night, that we funnel all the sci comm folks to
### last time

#### intro workshop

* "film strip" of the weeks' readings (2) & layout remix activity (as they walk in)
    * some years physically cutting the paper themselves to make images and words relate
* JK + JW model visual facilitation over time/explanation for lay audience 
    * student responsible for reading would have joined (i think last year they missed this class?)
* group formation and 2x2 binary activity using stage/green screen
* groups prep visual explanation of single figure/section of reading
* groups present at main table

building up visual elements as mode of explanation. Let's 

#### post workshop support/prepping materials
* consultations with emily/jordan
* came in for office hours, leaving materials here to continue working on

#### student recordings
* some groups wanted to record a few times

#### office hours for editing support

#### final viewing celebration
* in the classroom
* each video played, JW gave feedback on what went well





## [DD pasted notes from consultation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XrDvHtngl161iI4awNPK3TBJL87k-NAVVmmqJGr_GAc/edit)

Flow of support
-   Towards beginning of the semester - brainstorm session about what the group projects will be. Objective is to get students comfortable explaining complex topics in SCRB to general audience. 5 minute-ish scripted video - identify topic and convey the overarching issues, and tackle one specific aspect that is currently controversial or unsettled or theoretical. They work with bok in a few ways
    -   Workshop in early September - really cool way to start the class, we’re an icebreaker but also get them to start thinking about their projects  
    -   End of semester - viewing party   
    -   Teaching staff wants to get the students over to us sooner (for consultations/office hours/student support?)

Making public
* They'd like to be able to say here’s the site or here’s the youtube channel with all the videos.

What she'd like to improve on:
* She’d like to think about ways to make the students engage earlier so it doesn’t become a totally all at the end of the year thing
* She tried to swap scripts and they get a grade on evaluating other students
* That posed challenges she didn’t anticipate
* If there’s a halfway mark, for feedback? Is it peer peer? Etc.

Re: ai
* They write paper synopses - they can use chatgpt but she expects them to tell her that they did, and to tell her how they approved it to make it submissible to the class. Jessica asked what we think of it
    * Mk said it seems authentic, tho they could also ask chatgpt for reflection. Media assignments are more clear there’s something they still have to do - if they have to internalize the ideas to perform, etc. if you’re being judged on the final project 
    * She’s thinking of it as an aid like google. 
    * Marlon’s sense was that there was enthusiasm/recommendations for oral assignments, and a film assignment are like that. It’s more about the performance.
* Jessica asked what mk would tell them
    * You’re encouraged to get chatgpt’s feedback on early versions of your script and visual ideas. They’ll still have to do important work on internalizing the material and ideas so they’re not reciting a script, so they can deliver a semi improvised talk 
    * mk said she could ask them to submit their chatgpt transcript if she wants, show their work as they’re going along
    *  She could say she wants them to spend an hour a week chatting with chatgpt about their assignment, or get feedback on their scripts
    *  We can get transcripts of the oral assignments, and allow them to use that as a first draft. Would be fun to use AI tools to grab that and work at augmenting it
    * TF really likes the idea of them submitting their chats with chatgpt.
    *  Mk - We need to teach students how to work with generative AI. but turning in the record of the convo is where the teaching staff could give feedback on their prompts
    *  Mk asked if she would be open - if mk and jordan took a stab at a doc of a scaffolded steps for a chatgpt assisted video assignment - details around that, file formats, etc. -- she would LOVE that.

  
### Re: upcoming workshop:

-   Jk mentioned her and emily meeting with each of the student groups, and that worked well and would love the idea of that happening early.
-  Jk wanted to connect on main goals for the students - what kind of thinking is important, what are the learning objectives of the assignment and how can that be brought into alignment with the 
    -  one objective is to understand the current state of the art in the field and what’s going on. Bigger thing is their ability to communicate a complex issue, distilled into its most basic structure, and to explain to someone not practiced in SCRB how it works and what the considerations are to be kept in mind, its relevance to public and human health. Almost all of her students go on to medical school. Many of her students have written about how important it is to them, being able to communicate complex things to their patients. Distilling the essence of the problem.  Getting into the political and ethical issues and implications as well.     
-   the coral reef one was highlighted
-   Are there moves made within the projects that she found were really successful
    -   Hair regrowth group - comedy to engage the audience
    -   Ones that don’t go so well are folks reading from the script and not animated
    -   Use of props - when its effective those are always the best
    -   None of them are super comfortable in front of the camera (dialogue sometimes happens and it normally works but most of them don’t do this) - she’s open to improv
-   Mk said we have done filmed oral exams. Mk said sometimes the TF will come in and listen and then the TF asks one or a few questions and you get an improv response, of the sort they would get at a talk
-   If its not perfectly scripted, ted-ed explainer video, that might take the pressure off of them and they could be a bit more natural, more human moment potentially
-   Maybe we don’t do editing beyond the overhead and maybe the medium shot on camera
-   JW loves this, maybe wants to do this
-   TF was wondering - in her experience, if students have a script they can look at, they ONLY do that. She doesn’t want to say they should remove it because it can be comforting, but wants to encourage the students not to rely on it. If they’re responding to questions, “just tell me about it” etc.
    -   Mk said it’s like giving me a tour of something spatial (like a town metaphor) rather than something that’s linear. These are the five spots i want to take the audience, and i worked hard to understand them, etc. jessica likes that too
    -   In that case they might not have a written script, but MK said they could have 3 to 5 core visual elements and a storyboard of them. Not necessarily figures but human understandable figures
    -   They won’t forget, they’ll have the figures and they should know it
    -   
We’ll work on scaffolding steps. And that could dictate what they might do for the workshop

## JK Notes from past
 * [SCRB111](/67C9OM2kTtaGUwl0JoOlOw) 2021-22


## to do's
* confirm with JW what the readings are for this year
* send a doc back on Monday that makes sense at a high level
    * ai-supported video assignment support will take these 3 or so forms
        * project log mechanic - assisting the students in documenting the entirety of their work across the project. we're providing them with direct support as consultants and capturers of media. students are incentivized to make sense of our help so they can get this record. we'd also recommend they take photos of their convos with chatgpt that they share with us. it should be structured (certain number necessary)
        * consultations
        * media support
