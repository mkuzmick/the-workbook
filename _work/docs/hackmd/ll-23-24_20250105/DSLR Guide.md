*  1 Sandisk micro SD card

**Assembling your DSLR**
1.  **Place batteries in battery compartment**.This compartment is located underneath the camera on the right side labeled " BATT.OPEN"
2.  **Insert Micro SD**. on the right side of the camera, you will find a compartment labled "CARD OPEN". Slide compartment open and insert Micro SD.
3.  **Attach lense**
- Screw protective caps off back of lense and front of camera to reveal snesors
- Caution! Be weary of the uncovered sensors. They are the most expensive part of camera and should be treated with caution.Do your best to keep dust/particles out of sensor and avoid bright lights. Sensors should only be uncoevered for a limted time to attach lenses to cameras.
- Align the red dot of the EF lense with the camera and gently push in.Once in, turn clockwise till you hear a click. Do not force lense into camera. If your lense does not have a red dot, it is not compatabale with the red dot camera.
- Once lense is secured in camera, remove the lense cap and turn on your camera.

**Setting up your Camera**

1. **Turn on the camera** by flicking on the ON button
2.  **Set camera to manual**. This will allow you to control the way your photo/footage looks. On top left of camera you will find a scroll wheel with a bunch of camera modes. Thw white markerto the right of the camera is what mode your camera is currently using. Scroll till the M is next to white marker.
3. **Reformat Micro SD card**. 
* Before any shoot, always reformat your sd cards. Your SD cards are where your footage will be recorded and stored. If you use the same sd card on two seperate shoots, your footage will be stored from both. If you fill up the card's storage, it will be unuseable until you export the footage.BY reformatting the sd card, you are wiping the card clean so its ready for the new shoot.
* To reformat the drive, click the MENU button located on the top left of the camera.

* scroll your cursor over the " FORMAT CARD" option
* Press the SET button near your scroll wheel to choose the option
