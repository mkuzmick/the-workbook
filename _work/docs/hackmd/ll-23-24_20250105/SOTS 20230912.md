# SOTS 20230912

## messy notes
things that recently popped up:
* the resources
    * we want to get all of our resources into one place
    * figure out what AI assistance can we get with these - cleaning them up, even just identifying what's in them
    * get them all on github and then airtable. then use scripting
* game mechanics
    * pick as few protoypes that covers as many mechanics, readings, and workflows as possible
    * deliverables:
        * capture workflow (the system that makes it easy for us to record this amount of students well) (MK+SL)
        * airtable inventory of game mechanics (better version of the board conrad made) (SL+MW+MK)
            * use AI as enrichment instead of lorem mipsum
                * focus on building the machine, the metasystem around producing content with AI. prototyping workflows. 
                    * the end result may be a game mechanic dictionary or personalized notebooks for the workshop, but those things ae not the goal. They are the by-product of the system we create. 
                        * intersection of ai generation and in-person lived experiences 
            * pull out old game resources in an airtable and try to enrich
        *  1 or 2 close readings of mechanics with gifs etc. (SL+MK+MW)
            * instances of mechanics in the games that the class is referencing
            * see if vidyan wants to see more or ideas of incorporating and how to build to final project
    
## other do your work work
* finish top templates and test+clean
* madeleine to start consolidating the resources
    * everytime we define a schema in airtable, checkin 
    * mk also knows where the things are
    * do a github tutorial (make sure you have a github account and can clone the resources repository)
        * prob make a new github for the resources in the studio account
        * also get LLUFs/MPAs to start turning google docs and other resources into markdown 
        * this should become a next app
    * another goal: how and where to store hack.md resources
* as MW works on resources, start working on the plan for slugs across bases
    * there should basically be 3 columns for slugs:
        * one is a formula generated off human written title
        * one is manual override
        * one is actual slug
    * (we also need this to let us know if there are multiple so it's no longer unique)


## for mk+dd written report:
* make sure people + projects from this year, and some in the past, are good to go
