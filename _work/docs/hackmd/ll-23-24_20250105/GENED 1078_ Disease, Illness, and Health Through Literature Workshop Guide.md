## Workshop Plan

### unpacking exercise
First, we'll discuss a couple of models that will help us conceptualize what the "machine" of podcasts and video essays do, namely how their constituent parts work together to tell a compelling story that is accessible to the listener/viewer. Though we'll talk about the specific affordances of these two media, this approach--of analyzing closely those media forms you're thinking of working in--can work for any medium you end up choosing for your final creative project.

close-viewing: Vox, "The US medical system is still haunted by slavery "

**note**: every media form has its specific ways of communicating knowledge and insight, representing and conveying experience, and reaching an imagined audience. Choose your medium intentionally for this final creative project, depending on your goals and the specific story you want to tell.

### activity: what can media forms *do*?
* We've set up a few stations to introduce you to some of these media affordances, to help you learn about what film, sound, a/v editing, and illustration and graphic design can conceptually do. The stations are:
    * podcasts/audio capture + editing
    * video essays/montage + editing
    * collaging, illustration, and graphic design
* Each of you will **pair up with a partner, choose one of your course readings/an excerpt from the reading**, and visit at least 2 stations
    * As you visit each station, think about **how you would use that medium to remediate that reading**
* Then, you'll work with a partner to fill in your **worksheets**, which will ask you about:
    * Your project idea
    * What medium would be best-suited to communicate your insights, story, etc.
    * What your next steps will be (i.e., what steps you'll take to get started!)
    * We'll have a **worksheet for you to fill out to help guide your thinking**!

## Resources

### Podcasting Tips
#### **Step 1: Planning**:
* Every podcast tells a story of some kind: Whether it's establishing some kind of a mystery that the podcast will resolve or posing a question that warrants considerable attention and unpacking, intentionally designed podcasts lead the listener through a narrative comprising a range of sounds, voices, and perspectives.
    * Think about the questions or the mystery that your podcast will attempt to resolve
    * what do you want your listeners to know by the end of the episode?
    * what insights do you you want to share, or what responses from your audience do you want to provoke?
    * make some initial notes that will help you design your podcast as you select guests, music beds, and other important features of your podcast.
* Because podcasts are rich and engaging stories, it's important to plan your podcast episode thoroughly, building a narrative arc that structures your audio story
    * You can try writing out an audio storyboard for your podcast, noting the order, for instance, in which you might ask particular questions
    * or the types of sounds (music, effects, people speaking) and the order in which you anticipate using them
* One of the most popular storytelling devices that podcasts deploy is the interview, where guests and a host discuss a topic at length. 
    * a key way to prepare for this type of podcast is to share the topic and maybe even some broad questions that you'll discuss during the recording
    * taking this step of sending topics and even questions beforehand will help to avoid filler uhms, ahs, and thinking pauses that would need to be edited out later
    * it can also help folks prepare interesting anecdotes that they'd like to share, as a way of making their perspective on a given topic more concrete and relatable
#### **Step 2: Gather Equipment**

#### **Microphones:** **USB vs. XLR**
- **USB** microphones are convenient as they are plug-and-play, making them a solid choice for beginners.
- 	**XLR** microphones are often superior in terms of audio quality and can sometimes be cost-effective. However, they require an audio interface, which can add to the overall cost.

**Recommended USB Microphone:** [Blue Yeti USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Creators-Condenser-Microphone-988-000100/dp/B00N1YPXW2/ref=asc_df_B00N1YPXW2/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309707619534&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12375264689150081700&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001999&hvtargid=pla-361504918229&psc=1) or the [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=14IXS6ZNQECD6&keywords=shure%2Bmv7&qid=1695150081&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=sure%2BMV7%2Cmi%2C114&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
**Recommended XLR Microphone:** [RØDE PodMic](https://www.amazon.com/Versatile-Microphone-Connectivity-Podcasting-Music-Making/dp/B07MSCRCVK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UP0Y87S3BR93&keywords=rode%2Bpodmic%2Busb&qid=1695149924&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=rode%2Bpod%2Cmi%2C107&sr=1-2&th=1) or the [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=14IXS6ZNQECD6&keywords=shure%2Bmv7&qid=1695150081&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=sure%2BMV7%2Cmi%2C114&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
**Recommended Audio Interfaces:** [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B0C5JRTS3Y/ref=sr_1_4?crid=29C16VBN74JA1&keywords=focusrite%2Bscarlett%2B2i2&qid=1695148951&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=focusrite%2Cmi%2C174&sr=1-4&th=1) or the [PreSonus AudioBox USB](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-AudioBox-USB-25th-Anniversary/dp/B08D8R6VFC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1).

#### **Headphones:** 

When recording audio it is important to use headphones to monitor the way you sound. Use closed-back, over-ear headphones or in ear buds to monitor your audio during recording. This prevents sound leakage and interference. (Sound leakage refers to the audio coming out of your headphones and going back into your mic.)

---

#### **Step 3: Set Up Your Space**

#### **Handling Noise:**

- Choose a quiet room with minimal background noise. 
- If your computer fans are creating unwanted noise, try quitting unnecessary applications and webpages. 
- If you are conducting your interview using audio only, you may want to make a tent out of a blanket to record yourself under. While this may sound silly, it will really help to reduce echoes and improve sound quality.

---

#### **Sound Check:**

- **Microphone Placement:** Position your microphone at mouth level and a few inches away from your mouth. Angle it slightly downward to minimize plosives (P and B sounds).

- **Mic Check:** Record a short test clip to check the microphone and audio levels. Adjust your microphone position and input levels if necessary.
- **Headphones Check:** Listen through your headphones for any background noise, interference, or issues with your microphone placement.

#### **If You Are Using...**

#### Zoom Platform:
Zoom is a great option for recording remote podcasts, primarily for its familiarity. Inviting guests to a video call and starting the recording process is straightforward and user-friendly.

[Click here for a guide on how to record audio with Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings) (the recorded audio will be a .M4A file).

If you are on Zoom's free version and are hosting more than one guest in your online meeting, your recording can only last 40 minutes. You can bypass this by setting a timer and starting a new meeting. 

#### Digital Audio Workstation:
A DAW, like GarageBand or Logic Pro, is another great option for recording podcasts. While you will not be able to record guests remotely with it, a DAW will be essential if you need to join indivudual audio files together into one final mix.
After completing your recording, export that audio as either an .MP3 or .WAV.
    
Take a look at the supplied links below for more details on how to record using these DAWs:

- [GarageBand](https://www.captivate.fm/podcast-tools-software/how-edit-record-podcast-garageband#How_to_record_a_podcast_in_GarageBand)
- [Logic Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixZZMp7Nx80)
- [Audacity](https://riverside.fm/blog/audacity-for-podcasting#anchor4)
- [Audition](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/creating-podcasts.html)


#### Phone:

If the remote party cannot invest in equipment, they can record themselves using their phone's built-in recording app at the beginning of the interview.

- Ensure they are in a quiet, disturbance-free environment, as phone microphones won’t capture their voice as effectively as dedicated recording microphones would.
- The remote participant can then share their recording with you for further editing and integration into the podcast.

Google Drive, WeTransfer and/or AirDrop are solutions for sharing recordings. This way, you can bring it into a DAW of choice and combine all your audio assets into one final mix.

#### Exporting and Publishing

Once you feel satisfied with your edit, its time to export the finished product. Podcasting has exploded in popularity in recent years, leaving you a plethora of social media/entertainment websites to publish to. When exporting your podcast, its always best to export it in a audio format widely accepted by most podcasting platforms. This includes formats such as .MP3, .WAV, and .M4A. 

#### Publishing the Podcast

Some free website hosts that serve as solid platforms for hosting your podcast include:

- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) (Yes, YouTube indeed is a viable option for a podcast! Even if you do not plan on recording video alongside audio, you can simply use a still image for the duration of the podcast)

If you wish to pursure a larger website host, consider options such as:
- [Spotify for Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)
- [Apple Podcasts](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/login?targetUrl=%2F&authResult=FAILED)
- [iHeart Radio](https://podcasters.iheart.com/)

These hosts have more features to help with analytics and tracking, but may require an application submission, prerequisites and/or a subscription payment plan to use.

## Setting up your workspace

Premiere Pro is a non-destructive editor. This essentially means that you're manipulating clips that are existing files, referenced from within your hard drive, and when you export the film, it's creating copies of your work. So, naturally, whenever you're working in a system that references files, you should keep meticulous care to organize your work. 

There are two levels of organization to start with, where you keep your files, and how you see them show up in Premiere's file manager. 

I highly recommend that you maintain a structured set of folders that allow you to track this information independently of Premiere's organizational system. This will make it so that if your hard drive is disconnected, or you move from computer to computer, you can easily make it back to all those referenced files. 

We most commonly organize our footage by the date and time it was shot. But that's not the perfect solution for everyone. So think about what information is valuable, and go from there. 

Once you have all your footage and assets in one single location, you can feel free to import them into Premiere. 
- This can be done using File > Import > Media
- Or, you can simply drag them from your file system into the app's file manager. 

Once in your Bin, you have the ability to add additional Folders, and rename your footage once again -- these changes will NOT effect the original files, so this is a way of freely annotating your footage without damaging future reference links. 

## The Nuts and Bolts

Once you have footage in the editor, you can finally start doing the core functions of editing. This is done dominently in the Sequence pane -- this is the timeline in which you'll assemble your edit. 

Start with double clicking your footage in your Project pane, this will show in the Source window -- this will always show your original footage. 

Play your footage back, and when you find the START of a clip you'd like to start assembling with, press "I" on your keyboard, this will set your In Point. Next, play the video and when you reach the point you want your clip to stop, hit "O" on your keyboard. This will set your Out Point. 

Finally, to start adding these to your timeline, press your "comma" key. This will Insert your clip into your timline. It's important to note that it will end up wherever your timeline
