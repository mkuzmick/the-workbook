# LLUF Drives

## Where are the drives?

1. There are light blue drives at the front desk labeled LLUF1, LLUF2, etc

## How do I get footage?

1. Plug your computer into ethernet (Make sure to plug it into a D port!)

2. Find your folder in the /_people/ folder or make one if yours is not there
3. Log into synology 10
**For Projects:** go to _people > _fellows > "your name" (if your name isn't there make a folder with your name and last name initial)
**For Footage:** go to _proxy > the month you're looking for > the day you're looking for

4. Copy the desired footage to your People folder

## Why do we keep projects and footage separate?
Organizing projects and footage separately keeps footage from being duplicated and uploaded multiple times. Footage takes up a lot of storage space and can cause the servers to fill up quickly and even cause them to slow down. Having duplicates of the same footage can cause issues with relinking footage to editing projects later as well. 

A good way to keep your folder organized is having a _footage folder and a _project folder. Here is an example:

If you want to rename footage (ex. you want to rename a video to "close up") always do so ***within*** your final cut/davinci/etc. project. If you rename the file itself and not inside your video editor it will be impossible to relink your files if you want to change the project later. 

***All footage and projects will be cleared off of working LLUF drives regularly so make sure you back up your files or hand them off to Sophie.***

## What should I do when I'm done?

1. Give the drive to Sophie or leave it at their desk
