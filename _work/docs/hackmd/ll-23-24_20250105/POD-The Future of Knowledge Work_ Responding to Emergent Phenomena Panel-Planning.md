# POD-The Future of Knowledge Work: Responding to Emergent Phenomena Panel-Planning

## before the event
* run through for ll staff on Monday, November 6, 10:30-11:30am
* Text of our accepted [POD Roundtable Proposal](/Tr0LpwmfTue1Kq0Z9jAc3g)
## event
* Pod Conference Panel is Tuesday, November 14, 1-2pm
* Pod theme: *Envisioning the Future: Developing Equitable Opportunities for Success*
    * we need to figure out the logistics of where and how we're zooming
## notes
* good to have visuals / videos (to show under overhead?) - not a slideshow
* potentially session notes to share
## flow
### christine
* intro to the panel
    * what we're discussing
    * how it connects to the conference
    * introduce each of our speakers
    * set up the flow 
        * we'll each talk for a few minutes in pairs
        * and then open it up for discussion
### marlon and dani
* what the LL is
    * an incubator/accelerator for innovative faculty projects related to teaching and learning
    * many of our projects involving students engaging with technology and the arts in new and unconventional ways
* dani on facts and figures
    * how many courses per year
    * how many faculty per year
    * almost report-like data
* the challenge of running something like this:
    * can't do anything until you're asked
    * aren't ready when asked if you haven't done it
    * therefore the need to rapid prototyping and experimentation, 
    * to test things out with faculty and students ASAP in a safe and dynamic space, where the cycles of iteration are once a year, but several times per day
    * we need in house skills, because the cost of outsourcing to contractors is way beyond what we can handle
    * so the learning of the staff and fellows are central to our project, and learning how to learn independently is the most important element of the whole system
    * range of tools (typical list)
* we need to be able respond to any faculty desire, any senior leadership priority, any emergency (and we'll discuss the latest emergency/priority AI in a bit)
* but first let's hand it back to Christine and then Jordan, who will spend the bulk of our time discussing the roles the student fellows play in our community
    * combining new literacies with academic skills?




### christine
* mdf program
    * what it is/how it is future-oriented
    * stats from DD - here are types of projects faculty have been bringing to us
    * multimodal as an example of new thing we respond to
    * what mdfs do/how they help us prepare for the future
    * what it helps them do: preparing grads for future careers in the academy (which increasingly are staff, not faculty, roles)
    * idea of involving graduate students - what does this look like
        * how to communicate their ideas and not just research them
        * workshops that introduce them to open-source tools for multimodal teaching
        * shared resources across institutions/making work radically public
        * connecting them to institutions that are doing this work (like Middlebury College's Scholarship in Sound & Image) and provide funding for grads to do that work
* ai faculty trainings as helping them to think about research and teaching in ways that align with mdf program/work grads are already doing?
    * helping faculty now in a similar capacity as we do mdfs - preparing them for a radical shift in knowledge work, helping them craft new assignments
### jordan
- in crafitng and designing, we engage in a rapid experimentation process, one in which we leverage our undergraduate fellows. 
- initally, user testers, etc.
- 
- speed of iteration and ability to take risks in designing innovations, pushing the boundaires of the future of knowledge work is made possible by our intergenerationaal team, especially our fellows, and working alongside the MDFs, our LLUFs - originally user testers but crucially co-designers - are 
- Dewey - oriented towards future knowledge work, grounded in T & L theory 
    - teaching cannot occur in isolation, the two must be integrated seamlessly

- the space - a mixed use media and design studio wrapped in a film studio, documenting the work we do in real time, giving students and their teachiers real time feedback on their learning process, much akin to reggio emilia making learning visible. 
- this combination of our fellows and our space, the pace of iteration, experiemntation, and innovation that we have been able to engage in is beginning to really take off in an unbeliavaby exponential way becasue of AI, and I'll let M and D jump in here to tell you some of the ways we this is happening.

### marlon and dani again
(depending on how much time we have)
* specific thing right now is AI, 
* in the classroom
    * for students and faculty, lowering the "cost" and barriers to entry for non-textual media
    * a democratization of complex technical and artistic tools and workflows
* in our own work
    * scaling things that were too bespoke in the past
    * tutorials, feedback, etc.
    * the AI can't replace the human, but this isn't the point---the irreplaceable humans don't have enough time to do everything; so the point is for them to direct the AI.
* experiments
    * slack bots in theatre course
    * automations in reporting
* 


## arc
### mk+dd
what is the LL
some stats
prototyping + stack of support

### jk
dewey - can't talk about teaching in isolation from learning
lluf position from testers to co-designers
full stack of support + multimodal 

### cd
mdfs

### mk+dd

### questions


## to do
* get stats
* figure out visuals/ videos/ examples to show
* prep notes


### stats
#### from annual report
In 2022-2023, the LL
-   Supported 105 courses and projects across 35 departments and programs, enrolling 3,978 undergraduates students.
-   Hosted 259 workshops and events in the Learning Lab Studio to help students develop new skills, complete course projects, and present their work. 
-   Held 673 film shoots â€“ capturing 3186 hours of footage consisting of student projects, presentations, reflections, and more.

Our intergenerational design team:
- 47 Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (LLUFs) tested assignments, created prototypes for course resources, assisted with workshops and live events, and acted as peer tutors in office hours.
- 25   Media & Design Fellows (MDFs) developed and deployed their skills in technology, art and performance; designed assignments and activities; led workshops for courses; and supported the implementation of innovative digital methods and tools in undergraduate courses at Harvard.**


#### others
* open office hours attendees - 
    * 95 in the fall, 30 in the spring (potentially the influence of chatgpt? so we're pivoting this year)
