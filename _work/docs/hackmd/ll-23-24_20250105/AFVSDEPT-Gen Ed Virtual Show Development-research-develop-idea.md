# AFVSDEPT-Gen Ed Virtual Show Development-research-develop-idea

## Description and Notes

### Context
This project was started by Matt Saunders as a means of organizing the different sections of his gen-ed: Painting's Doubt. That project can be found at [paintingsdoubt.studio](https://). Rather than focus on that project, I am not focusing on creating a Virtual Gallery fo the department that would correspond to the IRL Open Galleries hosted by AFVS at the end of each semester.
