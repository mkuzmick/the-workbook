# Music 30 Final Week Activities

## Part I (30 mins -- the actual performance of the piece will be about 10-12 minutes): Paper Piece

5 students

1) Screenshot of score for Benjamin Patterson's Paper Piece is in my Slack communication with Christine, but several copies already printed out
2) We determined that one ideal setup would be to have two students on the stool setup in center of lab (sitting on stools); one student by the huge hanging paper sheets on far side of lab; one student at the main table in front of the lights on blackboard; and one student by the green paper hanging on scaffolding near entrance to lab space. But this could be adjusted and students can also provide input on their placement. 
    - At each location, mics will be placed on stool or table in front of them. 
    - Cameras will be positioned so feeds appear on monitor in a side-by-side setup like in the trial run on 11/22. 
    - Projector positioned so that other feeds appear on the huge hanging sheets, while green paper allows for green-screened image/footage to appear on that area.
    -  As background footage, I'm not sure what would be best -- I know we were looking at some Mars footage and old sci-fi footage. I thought it might also be fun and fitting to have some origami planet-making or UFO tutorials(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ0VNARmsKQ&t=14s or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRkPOQVWdGY), but maybe that would be too distracting. Maybe Jessie will have thoughts on that at the beginning of workshop.
4) According to the score, each student has 15 sheets (7 for shake/break/tear, 5 for crumple/rumple/bumple, 3 for rub/scrub/twist) and 3 bags. There is certainly some leeway here. Students can use the kits prepared by LLUFs but also supplement with additional paper products provided in bulk.
5) Before the official beginning of the piece (announced by Jessie or staff), give students some time to familiarize themselves with the sound possibilities of each different action from the score, different types of paper, different distances from the microphone, etc.
6) I think the most important thing about performing this piece is to think about *communication* and *reaction*. It may feel silly at first, but they can imagine having a conversation across the room, but using only the sound of paper and not voices etc. This could mean that not everyone is always making sound -- someone might just be listening and waiting to respond. Encourage them to have fun but also to be a little overdramatic about it! Like they're really telling a story, with a distinct beginning, middle, and end.
7) We can cede to Jessie about the exact reasons for performing this, but can tie it to their work incorporating found sounds into their final projects: shows that even everyday sounds can be complex and deployed in meaningful ways -- these sounds can be "performed" with real expression. Can imagine how that expression can also come through in the way they edit the sounds.

Quote from Benjamin Patterson: “What I try to do is open people’s minds, ears, and eyes, not necessarily with shock technique, but with surprises and unexpected things so they become more aware and sensitive to the world around them.”

## Part II (30 mins): Working on final projects


I presume students will be working on their own devices for this portion of the workshop, as it seems their projects are already underway. Most are using Audacity and Garageband, but I don't imagine they would need to transfer to one of our computers just for the workshop. Jessie mentioned one student is recording a bunch of found objects, another is using field recording and mixing with his own music.



It sounded like Jessie was thinking of this section as being quite open-ended, just lightly supervised time to work on the projects, get some light feedback and ask questions.
