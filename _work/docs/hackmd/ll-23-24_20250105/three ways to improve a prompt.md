# Three ways to improve a prompt

## description

AI tools like chatGPT do not have insight about your intentions, and these tools do not have intentions or insights of their own. They simply predict the likelihood of terms, phrases, etc. appearing in close proximity, and they use this probability to craft their responses to user input. This is why prompting is so important: It's *the way* that the AI understands what you are asking for (as it cannot make inferences or interrogate the assumptions underlying what you're asking).

Here are three ways you can think about improving your prompts:
* Hone your natural language
    * i.e. ask a better question
* Give the AI a persona
    * Tell it what kind of answer, what register of voice, what kind of context, etc. is appropriate
* Engage in a dialogue with the AI
    * It remembers previous steps in your conversation, and you can critique it and nudge it as you go

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4.
    *  We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

3. Ask chat GPT an initial question about a concept
4. Ask chat GPT to give you some theories and/or research related to that topic
    * check the citations to see if it's correct!
5. Ask chat GPT to help you come up with activities that would allow you to practically apply it (or you can come up with a prompt that better suits your purposes!)

## Transcript of activity example: 
* USER: 
    * What is Active Learning?
* AI: 
    * Active Learning is a teaching method that emphasizes the involvement of students in the learning process. Instead of passively receiving information, students in an active learning environment are encouraged to participate through activities such as reading, writing, discussion, or problem-solving, which promote analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of class content.

        This method is based on the premise that students who actively engage with the material are more likely to retain information and understand complex concepts. It's often contrasted with traditional lecture-style teaching, where students primarily listen and take notes.

        In the context of machine learning, active learning is a special case of semi-supervised machine learning. In an active learning system, after an initial model is trained, the system can query the user (or some other information source) to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. In other words, the learning algorithm actively chooses which instances to learn from. This is particularly useful when labeling instances is costly or time-consuming.
* USER: 
    * What are the different theories of active learning and who has researched this? I want your answer to be given in the context of a presentation about active learning that I need to deliver at an upcoming faculty meeting.
* AI: 
    * Certainly, I can provide an overview of some of the key theories and researchers in active learning.
        * Constructivist Learning Theory: This theory, attributed to Jean Piaget, emphasizes the idea that learners construct knowledge for themselves. In other words, students learn by fitting new information together with what they already know.
        * Social Constructivism: This theory, often associated with Lev Vygotsky, extends constructivist learning theory by emphasizing the importance of culture and context in understanding what occurs in society and constructing knowledge based on this understanding. Active learning strategies such as collaborative group work and peer teaching are often based on this theory.
        * Experiential Learning: Developed by David Kolb, this theory suggests that learning is a process that involves a cycle of experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. Active learning activities such as simulations, role plays, and fieldwork are often based on this theory.
        * Self-Directed Learning: Malcolm Knowles is often associated with this theory, which suggests that adults are intrinsically motivated to learn and that they learn best when they have control over their learning experiences. Active learning strategies that allow students to direct their own learning, such as independent research projects, are often based on this theory.
        * Problem-Based Learning: This approach, often associated with Howard Barrows, emphasizes the use of real-world problems as a context for students to learn critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
        * Inquiry-Based Learning: This theory suggests that by guiding students to ask their own questions, seek their own answers, and develop their own solutions, they are more likely to be engaged and to learn effectively. This approach is often associated with the work of John Dewey.
        * Transformative Learning Theory: Jack Mezirow developed this theory, which suggests that the process of learning involves challenging and changing learners' beliefs and assumptions. Active learning strategies that encourage critical reflection and dialogue are often based on this theory.

        In your presentation, you might want to discuss these theories and give examples of how they can be applied in the classroom. You could also discuss the research evidence supporting the effectiveness of active learning. For instance, a meta-analysis by Freeman et al. in 2014 found that active learning leads to increases in examination performance and decreases in failure rates in undergraduate STEM courses.
* USER: 
* AI: 
    * Absolutely, here are ten active learning strategies that you can incorporate into your course on Proto-Indo-European etymologies:
        * Interactive Lectures: Break up your lectures with short activities that let students apply what they've just learned. For example, after explaining a concept, you could present a Proto-Indo-European root and ask students to guess its meaning or its derivatives in modern languages.
        * Think-Pair-Share: Pose a question or problem to the class. Give students a minute to think about their response, then pair up to discuss their thoughts, and finally share their conclusions with the class. This could be used to discuss the possible evolution of a certain word or phrase.
        * Group Projects: Assign students to work in small groups on a research project. They could explore the etymology of a set of related words, or compare the Proto-Indo-European roots of words in different Indo-European languages.
        * Peer Teaching: Have students prepare and deliver a short lesson on a specific topic, such as the etymology of words related to a particular theme (like nature, emotions, etc.).
        * Jigsaw Activity: Divide a large topic (like the influence of Proto-Indo-European on different language families) into smaller parts. Each student or group becomes an "expert" on one part and then teaches it to the others.
        * Case Studies: Provide students with real-life cases of how understanding Proto-Indo-European etymology can help in understanding modern languages. Students can analyze these cases in groups and present their findings.
        * Discussion Boards: Use online platforms to create discussion boards where students can post questions, share resources, and discuss topics related to the course. This can encourage collaborative learning outside of class.
        * Quizzes: Regular low-stakes quizzes can help students reinforce their understanding of the material and give you feedback on their progress. Quizzes could include identifying the Proto-Indo-European roots of modern words or explaining the phonetic changes that led to a modern word's pronunciation.
        * Role-Playing: Students can take on the roles of linguists proposing theories about Proto-Indo-European etymology. This can help them understand the process of linguistic research and the debates within the field.
        * Reflection Activities: Ask students to write brief reflections on what they've learned after each unit. This can help them consolidate their understanding and give you feedback on which concepts might need further clarification.

        Remember, the key to successful active learning is to choose activities that align with your learning objectives and to provide clear instructions and feedback.
