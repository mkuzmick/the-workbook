# menu of dec-jan projects
We're super excited to have time to learn and make things the next few weeks, and we're exciting for everyone to work collaboratively on these project.

The key thing is that we need prototypes and resources from each of these experiments - so please, document your process and your work! 

## how to get started
* talk to mk and dd about what you're interested in
* mk and dd will help you figure out what part of these large projects to work on
* as you work on each task, please
    * post updates of each thing you complete in #ll-show-your-work
    * document the steps you are taking in a resource tutorial for each thing you're doing, as you're learning
    * include an estimate of how much time it took you

## Anchored to Courses/Projects
* COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy: Imagination, Invention, Radical Pedagogy (Munari / Rodari / Calvino) - Jeffrey Schnapp
    * ai bots...
    * 2 exploratory prototypes of mechanics/capacities we can use:
        * remixing folklore motifs 
            * (ai bots would not write stories, but combine a bunch of folklore mechanics/motifs and students have to write a tale based on the architecture provided by the bots)
        * folktale unification
            * have an ai read multiple versions of one tale (that a student has harvested from various sources; textual, visual, transcripts of audio) and combine it into a "ultimate" version
            * OR a mashup of tales from different traditions with similar structures.
* [EMR 162: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Race and Artificial Intelligence](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UEy8ZvNhySW5lPyjkinHFWApUkgjNreZ) - Leslie Fernandez
    * mk pitched designing ways for the students to see what’s under the hood of some of the GAI tools, and then to be able to also see under the hood what happens when they bots interact with each other over time
        * google colab stuff?
        * train a model (maybe chris? python machine learning) (maybe graham?)
    * we also want to generate ideas about how to hang onto the students' research as they experiment with GAI tools, because it’s their data. Something that’s easy and not saving and renaming thousands of screenshots a day. That could maybe be built into the course’s architecture.
* [EMR 163: Asian American Graphic Narratives](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jY5h2sxABsKl5oL67z8h6CzuIt4DEJuN) - Leslie Fernandez
    * The students will be creating comic books. So we'd like to be able to show them a range of tools and workflows (including AI tools and workflows, like converting photos to comic-book style things) for doing this.
* EAFM 111: East Asian Media Studies (Alex Zahlten)
    * an activity that involves students prompting the AI in a storyboarding activity (storyboarding to film workflows)
    * also vtube?
        * talk to queenie, queenie will be working on a similar project
* ENGLISH189VG
    * update our knowledge of AI tools built in to the game engines
    * augment and enhance some of the mechanics from last year for students and instructors
        * documenting their gameplay
        * revealing recurrent tropes
        * creating essay/games
* Resources for the new GAI Course Assistants
    * We want to create resources for the things/tools/workflow the new GAI Course Assistants are going to need, and it will also be great to have these for our internal/future use too. Topics include but are not limited to:
        * coding basics for CA AI projects
        * OpenAI API
        * Slack API
        * Slack bots
        * Stable Diffusion
        * centralized resources about working in the LL
    * These can take many forms as we get started: videos, comic books, etc--there is definitely room for some of these to be multimodal. If people want to learn new tools and try things out, that's great, but let's do content that will be valuable for these AI projects.
* Julia Sharpe's workshops and resources for AFVS students documenting artistic process
    * resources on color (hue, lighting, white balance, etc)
    * this can be a good catch all for exploratory avLab projects

## Grounded in the LL (but to support our work in courses of course)
* printing from airtable
    * nextjs tools with user-selectable (or user-generated) styles
* website for image permissions (codelab project)
    * we'd love for students in workshops to see the the recently captured images, be able to select the ones they like, put in their email, and get sent them. this would give us permission to use their images on social media and they would also get the images to use themselves. we'd want, on the backend, to be able 
* Space build outs and organization
    * classroom
    * glass studio
    * music studio
    * front desk
        * and content for the front desk TV display to be playing all of the time
* resources base?
* jobs, instructions and style guides
    * buttons
    * main camera positions (framing for each)
    * photo basics
    * color
    * comic-book making
    * box-folding
    * card-cutting
    * atem switching
    * logic launching
* tools and mechanics
    * midi controllers
    * paper-folding, books, packaging
    * sewing/fabric
* prototypes for ways of using AI to make multimodal projects
