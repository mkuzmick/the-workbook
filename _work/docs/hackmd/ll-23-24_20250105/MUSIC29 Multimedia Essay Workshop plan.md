* Sound (Jordan)
    * pitch/voice
    * DAWs + PA + Instruments
## to dos

    * we'll print out film strips of the video essays that will be unpacked
* jk will brainstorm a type of checklist or callsheet (by showtime, they need to know what their physical visuals are, digital visualizations, what they're saying, who's saying what, if there will be music accompaniement, etc.)
* mk will bring in more instruments
