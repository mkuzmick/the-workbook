# COMPLIT 200 Colabs Project Prompt: Interactive AI Tools for Storytelling

## Course Description
In COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy: Imagination, Invention, Radical Pedagogy, students explore structural, combinatory, and generative thinking about storytelling through the lens of Munari, Rodari, and Calvino. The course combines literary theory and history with computer-assisted creation, using textual and visual AI tools, culminating in a curated volume of AI folktales.

## Context
We are creating an interactive platform for students to engage with coding and AI tools, focusing on API usage from major providers. This platform should simplify technical processes for those with minimal coding experience.

## Elements
- Development of user-friendly interfaces
- Simplification of technical concepts
- Creation of educational tools

### Deliverable
Proposals can be submitted verbally in a scheduled meeting or via Slack in the form of text messages, HackMD links, or a video pitch.
