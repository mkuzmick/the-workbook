# ll-today-20240403
## priorities
* HH
    * space/building truss for torus 
* AI
    * complit200 resources
* workflows
    * [sc on video delivery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lduE2v3GtEpHzLycFAHbG0iY1gn6Hi2dHun-ZbyRRyw/edit)
    * mk on event processing
    * post HH
* prep for workshops/events via prototyping what's needed (designLabs!)
    * socstd10b this week
        * space/studio prep
    * others upcoming:
        * gened1057
        * hist-lit10ab
        * complit280x

## tasks
* planning for SOCSTD10B (and designlab)
    * which llufs have read *Discpline and Punish*
    * prototypes
* sourcing inspiration for complit280x
    * eventually plan designlab/codelab worktime
* cc + sc taking down small studio truss, building HH support for torus

* root level of studio@learninglab.xyz 
    * pull every individual file in the drive into either: 
        * LL Studio Archive 
        * LL Studio SD 
            * then mw clean out archive
                * save interesting outputs 
                * delete everything else 
    * **STATUS: DONE**

* mw
* create a base of our colabs 
    * in airtable 
        * identify the colabs, a path, and a short description 
            * mw/mk/gaica next step: 
                * to create brand-new colabs for complit200, using this as a reference
                * malleable library for other courses as well, curated 
    * **STATUS: in progress**

* prototyping complit200 
    * workshop-visible projects → reporting 
        * SD: 
            * continue to get LLUFs to generate stable diffusion images w/ controlnet 
                * 5-10 images each
                * save to img-2-md
        * **STATUS: in progress**
    * GAICAs → how-to resources 
        * tutorial and walkthrough links
        * video walkthroughs of things
            * single items, should be 5> min
                * (colabs, assistant APIs, file uploads, prompt engineering)
            * walkthrough specifically for complit, just flag it could be used more generally
