# cd POD notes

## intro to panel (3-5 mins)

* Thank you for joining us for a roundtable discussion of The Future of Knowledge Work: Responding to Emergent Phenomena
* My name is Christine D'Auria, and I'm very excited to moderating this panel today with my colleagues from the Learning Lab, which is part of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard University
* We'd like to begin our panel with a land acknowledgement:
    * Harvard University (where we are currently located) is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusett, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. We pay respect to the people of the Massachusett Tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself which remains sacred to the Massachusett People.
* Our roundtable takes up POD's theme of envisioning the future of educational development and how to ensure the success of educational endeavors at all levels in the institution
* our roundtable shares POD's commitment to thinking about educational development as pedagogical work that takes into account faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and educational support staff like ourselves
* today, each of us is excited to speak about the different types of pedagogical support, the fellows programs, and the internal systems that we have developed at the Learning Lab and that together comprise a multigenerational, student-centered approach to developing the knowledge work of the future
* we've seen over the past few years--from the Covid-19 pandemic and the shift to online/remote learning and now with the emergence of generative AI--that teaching and learning centers across institutions are being called upon BECAUSE they're especially well positioned (we would argue even inherently well positioned) to respond to complex, emergent phenomena and to in many ways usher in the future of knowledge work at our respective institutions
* At teaching and learning centers, we continuously ask what knowledge work means, or will come to mean, based on the evidence we gather from students and faculty today.
* Our roundtable speakers will talk about the development of undergraduate and graduate fellowship programs that help students develop critical skills that support faculty who seek to further the possibilities of academic communication and that these students will need in their professional futures.
* And we'll also speak to the central administrative systems that we've developed to develop these projects using AI- and low code/no code tools
* I'd like each of our speakers to quickly introduce themselves, after which we'll each speak for a few minutes before opening up into a broader discussion
* we hope our audience will ask a ton of questions! and also participate in the discussion by sharing with us what the future of knowledge work might look like at their institution

## mdfs (3 - 5 mins)
* mdfs
    * help develop innovative, multimodal pedagogy (assignments that help students think conceptually about media/what it enables for academic communication, activities that help students learn, resources to complete multimodal assignments) to support Harvard courses where students are doing something unconventinoal
    * this multimodal horizon is the one that mdfs are crucial to helping us advance at the moment
    * MDFs support a range of projects each year
        * projects that help students develop their public speaking skills (like Tiny Desk in Music, support for senior thesis writers) - skills students will need really no matter the career that they end up pursuing
        * video essays for a range of courses in the humanities, social sciences, sciences to convey technical and complex content using a range of media forms (visuals, sound, text/graphics/animations)
        * science communication projects that help students learn how to communicate science to an imagined or actual public
        * graphic design for graphical abstracts, scientific posters, slides for presentations
        * video game workshops that introduce students to the digital tools used to actually construct video game assets and game environments (e.g., Blender, Unity), as well as the narrative structures that game designers use to map out the stories that structure gameplay (e.g., branching and string of pearl narratives)
        * film production workshops that help students think conceptually about the formal and narrative possilities obtained by layering different visuals together (this draws on our studio setup)
        * podcasts for translators in comparative literature, enabling them to reflect on their translation process and read excerpts from their translations (highlighting the act of translation as in and of itself a form of expression/representation)
        * virtual galleries in deep history that emphasize curation as a mode of argument
    * multimodal forms like these are the future we're responding to in higher education teaching and research
    * journals like the Journal of the [American Musicological Society](https://www.amsmusicology.org/) and [Cell](https://www.cell.com/video-guidelines) are already thinking about how to integrate media forms into their text but mdfs are actually taking this even a step further by thinking of media not just as illustrative but also as enabling a form of knowledge production that text alone cannot
    * mdfs help us prepare for that future by way of their disciplinary expertise, their intuitions about media forms and what those afford for their discipline, and their passion for developing cutting-edge pedagogical and research methods
    * what the mdf program helps them do: prepares grads for future careers in the academy
        * whether they're faculty or staff
        * knowledge work is changing
        * both teaching and research
        * our mdfs are responding to and helping to determine what this future will look like
        * they themselves become experts in this emerging domain
        * and they can anticipate the challenges students will have as they work in these media forms
        * and the challenges that faculty face as they develop new multimedia assignments
        * they develop important skills in project development and coordinating
        * and they learn how to develop rationales for their projects - which again is really important no matter what career they ultimately pursue
        * being able to articulate the value of what you're doing and encourage others to participate
    * the idea of involving graduate students - what does this look like in a broad sense?
        * helping grads learn how to communicate their ideas, and not just research them, is core to their development as fellows with us
        * workshops that introduce them to open-source tools for multimodal teaching helps them to imagine and plan for a future of doing this work beyond Harvard
        * shared resources across institutions/making work radically public encourages a collective project that can be considerably more complex and ambitious
        * encourages as well the type of metacognitive reflection that helps learners of all levels grow
* now I'm going to kick it over to Jordan Koffman in the studio! she's going to talk about the Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows Program and actually - Jordan, can you tell us about our studio space since you're in the action right now?!

## quotes from MDFs
"Working as an MDF has given me the creative momentum and pedagogical inspiration I never knew I needed. I am a PhD candidate in the History of Art and Architecture, an inherently visual discipline, and prior to being an MDF I had wanted to learn digital skills (adobe, coding, 3d modeling, video editing, etc) , but didn't know how or where to go about not only acquiring these skills but then integrating them into my teaching and research. As an MDF, I have been able to start chipping away at learning these skillsets with others eager to learn, collaborate and teach--a rare and treasured combination.  The learning center (with its resources and the people who work there) has enable me to expand and innovate in my approaches toward teaching, presenting my research and lectures, and crafting assignments. From bringing in students to paper prototype their final digital projects to creating mobile paper devices to help them grasp convoluted special and dimensional aspects of our course, being an MDF has provided the resources and training to better convey knowledge and more actively engage with those I am teaching."
