### the basic outline:

last year I had anywhere from 5-20 minutes with the students, so I really optimized for that unpredictability. 

some key elements I try to hit:

with filming, be intentional about:
- lighting. I do the 360 lighting demo, landing on the 10 & 2 rule of thumb-and get them to talk about how 
    - lighting from behind reminds them of horror movies, or anonymous sources
    - lighting from 10 or 2 mimics rembrant lighting, with the triangle lit on the cheek
- angle
    - high v low, and what that communicates to an audience. 
- composition and shot length
    - wide to medium to CU to XCU
    - notice where the negative space is in the frame
    - look at models of "portraits" to get a sense of what they are aiming for

when using canva
- go with the more simple templates, canva tends to nudge you towards slightly less than industry graphic design, but as long as you keep it simple, you should be making good graphic design choices



This year it looks like we will have between 60-75 minutes with them. 
* We talked about bringing in more of an "event-like" element. 
* We also talked about having them explore more creative ways of capturing their intro (like filming a monitor instead of doing a selfie) or doing some sort of challenge in pairs/small groups
* we talked about  incorporating some :sparkles:AI:sparkles: elements into the aesthetic choices, especially in the canva graphic design zone

last year, we did the following activity and it went really well, but it sounds like maybe the assignment has changed form last year (it was sci-com, videos...and now it sounds like it is posters). but we could think about this for the sci com workshop coming up!
**tournament style visual throw down jigsaw activity:** 
* 4 sections in the paper (intro, method, result, discussion) 16 groups given the article they've read. each section will be given to 4 groups. they have 10-15 minutes to develop a 1-2 minute oral-visual presentation on their section
* 4 groups of each section pair off and present to each other and then decides among themselves which one should proceed to the next step.
* the two remaining groups of each section present to each other and the entire section group decides which one proceeds
* the final four present in sequence at the main table
* we could incorporate a sort of The Voice mechanic too...where we have 4 staff/mdf "coaches" and each coach gets one group in each section-this way the competition could really be between the coaches and we could take the fall if anything fails terribly haha.


We definitely need to incorporate buttons into this one-so the mechanic that marlon was working on last friday would be perfect!


### ideas for poster workshop to try in design Lab:
- find sources on how pros read scientifc papers (aka it's not usually in linear order the way you read most academic papers, but rather bounces around perhaps from abstract to results to discussion, to limitations, to methods, etc.)
- look at a sci paper from class (do we have one already?)
- using cards and paper, cut to relative size/length of each section and move from a linear arrangement to a spatial arrangement

actually if we did the activity that we did for PSY 1018 last yer, that could be really cool-for the large chunk of it. I'll paste it here:
