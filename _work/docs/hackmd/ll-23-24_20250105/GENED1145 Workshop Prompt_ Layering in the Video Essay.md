# GENED1145 Workshop Prompt: **Layering** in the Video Essay

## Background

We have 4 upcoming workshops (on Oct 18 and 19) for Gen Ed 1145, "Global Japanese Cinema." The students have already produced one video essay for the course and are now about to work on a second. We want to offer a workshop on adding graphical elements to visual essays that will help them "level up" their work, adding new layers and depth (both literally and figuratively).

Ideally, our activities will

1. show some examples of layering in professionally-produced video essays
2. reference the way various modes of layering are ALSO happening in the cinema that the students are analyzing (they'll be doing a [reading on anime](https://drive.google.com/file/d/168kcu2LF_d-hj0yfxTGDfj58g7xCxwe-/view?usp=sharing) and some viewings that we may want to keep in mind)
3. use some materials from the films they're analyzing
4. show them some basic ideas on techniques and tools they might use that range from VERY easy (Canva, iPhone apps) on up to the more complex
5. make use of the layers we can manipulate with the ATEMs along with low-tech elements like art supplies
6. help them see how adding these graphical elements will help them make more insightful and penetrating arguments in their visual essays
7. set them up for success on the assignment


Once the workshop plan and stations are determined, we need to also send a resource (a markdown doc or a less-than-one-minute video trailer) to the professor about what the students will learn from the workshops.

## Ask
* Station/activity ideas for the workshop (by the date of the pitch session TBD)
* folks who can commit to making the resource trailer (by October 11)
* folks who are available and prepared to lead the workshop stations
    * Wednesday, October 18, 4:30-5:30pm
    * Thursday, October 19, 9-10am
    * Thursday, October 19, 3-4pm
    * Thursday, October 19, 4:30-5:30pm


### Deliverable
Your ideas - either pitched to us verbally (during our pitch session on Friday, October 6, 3-4:30pm ), or via slack (plain text messages, hackMD links, or video pitch).
