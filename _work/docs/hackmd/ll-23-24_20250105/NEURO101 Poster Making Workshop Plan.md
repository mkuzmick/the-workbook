### learning objectives
* Students will understand how we represent ideas graphically in space.  They will understand how we can communicate visually in a format that is static rather than animated.
* Students will learn to make graphic design choices intentionally and avoid adding elements that are distracting from the message they are trying to communicate.

### activities
* graphical representation of text
    * about
        * How can we express the abstract relationships among ideas graphically? Careful arrangment in space!
        * Using colored shapes, scissors, and no words, translate the ideas in your prompt into a graphical representation inspired by Duarte's Slideology diagrams.
    * statements
        * Event 1 leads to Event 2. Event 2 usually leads to Event 3 but can rarely also lead to Event 1.
        * There are two contrasting theories in your field. You have developed a new theory that incorporates aspects of both of the existing theories.
        * There are four objects. Object A is more closely related to Object B than Object C. Objects A, B, and C are all created from Object D.
        *  There are four foundational principles in your field. The principles are interconnected with one another.
        *  One big discovery in your field gave rise to many, independent follow up discoveries in subsequent years.

* tour of posters around the room
    * when you see something in a poster that strikes you as easily readable, legible- what are the parts of it that make sense?
* editing student posters
    * have student posters printed out
    * spend some time writing on them/cutting them out to edit them
    * share with each other why certain graphic design choices were made
    * make suggestions on how to improve the posters in another draft
