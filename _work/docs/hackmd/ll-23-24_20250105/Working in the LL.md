# Working in the LL

## Slack
You'll be invited to two workspaces to use as a GAI CA:
1. Bok Workspace
2. Learning Lab Experimental Workspace

### Bok Workspace
The Bok Workspace...

key channels for working:
* gai-ca-main
* util-img-2-md (post here to get markdown for a single image at a time)
 
public channels that may be of interest
* ll-ai-lab

We want to programmatically save the things you’re making and publish the news of you making them. We’ll use these additional slack channels below for this purpose:
- #util-img-2-md
    - post your images here if you want to get markdown for them (for instance, to get images into hackMD quickly and easily!)
    - images saved here are fair game for any of us to use so make sure you’re OK with them being published on, say, the web
- #ll-show-your-work
    - post your works-in-progress, i.e., a photo with short caption describing what you’re working on/learning 

Beyond these channels which are vital to our work, we have a whole universe of channels devoted to building community and connecting to each other's interests! Check out #ll-personality-quiz, #bok-pets, #bok-makes, and many many more!

### Slack tips/best practices
- Use channels, NOT DMs. DMs routinely get deleted!
- @ whoever you want to see your message so they are notified
- To communicate with the current GAICA cohort, we’ll be using the slack channel #gai-ca-main
- To communicate with the LL staff for independent, personal, or private communications, each GAICA has an individual channel (#gai-ca-name-i). Think of this channel as a DM to the Staff, where you will often get a faster response to a message than a typical DM.
- *command + K* lets you quickly search for any channel or post on slack!
