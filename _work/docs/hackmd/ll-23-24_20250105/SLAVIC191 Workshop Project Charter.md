## key info to complete
### More thought out, specific title: 
Silent Film Workshop: Learning by Making
### 2-3 sentence description:
We're engage students in a variety of filmmaking and film analysis projects that are hands and material. the goal is dfor students to learn by doing, performing filmmaking techniques themselves and understand what went into the films they're watching. and to begin to tthink of ways of articulating their claims with these visual tools.
### Initial tasks to delegate: 
* materials prepping
    * downloading the films
    * printing up stills from films
    * film strips from films
    * printing up the articles (a copy for marlon to read beforehand)
* we might want to connect the set up that casey is doing for 207 to a station for this workshop, we'll check in about that thursday
### Materials:
brainstorming materials to get help with


## messy notes
* potentially sophie/casey at a station with cameras
