# cd + jk lab crossover on printing planning 20231013
* what is it:
Lab crossovers, in general: a work time set a side for the memebers in our various labs to come together and leverage their existing skills to collaborate on a specific goal/project. akin to a hackathon. we make a thing together.
    * by the end of the worktime:
       *  some MVP has been completed
        * additional steps or refinements outlines

this one specifically:
the design challenge: we want to print a ton of things from markdown (like all our hackMDs to give back to studetns at the end of a workshop, like reports/stories on our fellows achievements, etc.). theres lots of ways we can apporache this-we can try to go dierectly from hackMD, we can go from airtable, we can copy markdown into vsCode and style and print from a local server running a browser view. We need folks to come with skills in at least one of the following areas:
* vs code
* css
* airtable 
* graphic design layout prinicples, especially as they relate to markdown

## ideas
* command line tool
* slack app
* css styling guide?
