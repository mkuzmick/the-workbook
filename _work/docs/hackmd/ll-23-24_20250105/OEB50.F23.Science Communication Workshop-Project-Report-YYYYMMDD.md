#  OEB50 Science Communication Workshop Report


## Information on the workshop


- Where: Learning Lab 
- When: 3rd of October 2023
- Goal: The goal of this workshop was to help undergraduate student to get tips and notions for creating their final assigment: a Podcast

## Project of our station (Alexia)
(capstone event plan + materials + delivery + any others)
* The workshop was organized in four stations. The station that Alexa and I worked for was called "Make connection". The goal of this station was to teach the students to be confortable and informal on communicating a scientific idea. 
* Set-up of our station: 
    * 3 groups of pairs, each having 14 prompts about important discoveries in Biology
    * Each group have to chose 1 discovery and express "why is it the most important discovery" by using 1/2 ideas. They could communicate ideas related to personnal connection, political connection etc.. 
    * Then they have to express their ideas on a 30 seconds speech on the main stage with a microphone. 
* Material: 4 sets of 14 buttons, main stage, microphone, camera for setting the image of the green screen
* Delivery: The goal was clear to the students. The challenge in general was to make it non-formal and to teach the student that when they'll be behind their microphone for their podcast, they'll have to engage the listener and make the listener in the converstation. 
* Feeling: I felt that that student really got into their roles and had really good innovative ways to share their discoveries, like: use of picture, gesture, voice varying, as well as personal examples, numbers, and seting up backgroud. 
The main thing for MDF and students was to make it a confortable converstation. 
* Possible improvment: Adding a step in the procedure that could be "while you do your speech add an unexpected act; i.e getting your voice louder, bringing an object to show, moving around..."
