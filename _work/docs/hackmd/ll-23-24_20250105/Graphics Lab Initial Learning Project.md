# Graphics Lab Initial Learning Project

## Intro
- graphics lab deploys graphic design throughout everything we make! Learn adobe creative suite tools like photoshop, illustrator, indesign, keynote, and more.
- [Graphics Lab Lookbook](/s20t6_x1QkOo0Ur7UxIYAA)
- why graphicsLab? Many of the things we need to explain as teachers and as academics (and really just as humans in the world!) are best explained visually.  Sometimes the data that we are analyzing is itself visual (a Frida Kahlo painting, C. elegans anatomy); sometimes we find it useful to visualize something that is actually quite abstract in order to render it more concrete to students (a process, a hierarchy, a dataset).
- we will be doing a ton of workshops that deploy the moves of graphic designers, and we will also be launching into even more support of high-level visual communication projects across a wide array of academic domains this year, expanding the types of support we provide for graduate students and faculty especially.

## The Initial Learning Project
- You will put together a branding package for your favorite course or department -learning how to make not just one, but a bunch of linked type things.
    - The package components:
        - syllabus
        - slides template
        - assignment 
        - physical notebook/exambook/workbook/interactive zine/artbook
        - certificate/diploma/superlative
        - logo
        - course event poster 
        - print-based packaging for kit
    - the tools you will learn: photoshop, illustrator, indesign, keynote, the really serious paper cutter, utility knives, the saddle stapler, aftereffects
    - you will build out your branding package, sharing each component as you work to get feedback and iteratively improve your design
  
### Some Steps to Get Started:

1. [visual identity system](/Le4LnqHoQFqCO0_rGbs3TQ)
    - be sure to grab any materials for "background research " including:
        - syllabus
        - course assignments
        - readings
        - any existing graphical elements used in the course or department or conetnration materials (is there a course or department webiste that has design elements at play already?)
2. begin
