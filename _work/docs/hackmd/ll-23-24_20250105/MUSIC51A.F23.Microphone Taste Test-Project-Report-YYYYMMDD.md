## Report text with embedded media
Music 51A is the music department's introductory music theory course. This semester, the course is introducing an assignment that asks the students to perform theoretical analysis of music texture using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). After consultation with the professor, we realized the first step in getting the students ready to perform this sort of analysis would be familiarizing themselves with the DAW of their choosing. In order to do so, we helped design scaffolded assignments which in turn required scaffolded support, the first of which being an assignment that asks students to record an accompaniment to a melody written by the Professor. In order to prepare students for this work of recording into a DAW while playing their own instruments, we worked together with John Pax at the music department's SoundLAB to put together a workshop on Microphones. 

Next steps including continuing to meet with course staff to plan further workshops related to the final DAW analysis assignment. 

###  WORKSHOP STRUCTURE
The workshop taught students polar patterns and allowed them to understand the basic acoustic physics of microphones. We focused on the following:

1. Omnidirectional (Omni):

* Captures sound from all directions equally.
* Example microphones: Audio-Technica AT2020, Neumann KM 184.
2. Cardioid:

* Picks up sound mainly from the front and rejects sound from the rear.
* Provides good isolation of the desired sound source, making it great for reducing background noise and feedback.
* Example microphones: Shure SM58, AKG C214.
3. Supercardioid: 
* More focused on the front with a narrower rear pickup compared to cardioid.
* Offers excellent isolation of the desired sound source while still minimizing off-axis sound.
* Example microphones: Sennheiser e865, Audio-Technica AT875R.
4. Bidirectional (Figure-8):

* Captures sound from the front and rear but rejects sound from the sides.
* Useful for capturing sound from two opposite directions or for interviews between two individuals.
* Example microphones: Audio-Technica AT4050, AKG Perception 420.
