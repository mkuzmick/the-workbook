# Podcasting Steps & Tips

Recording quality audio for a remote podcast requires careful planning and the right equipment and software. 

First, here are some different structures you can keep in mind as you plan your podcast. 

Then, we've included step-by-step instructions and some recommended gear to help you achieve the best results:

--------

## **Step 1: Planning**:
### Ideation stage
* Every podcast tells a story of some kind: Whether it's establishing some kind of a mystery that the podcast will resolve or posing a question that warrants considerable attention and unpacking, intentionally designed podcasts lead the listener through a narrative comprising a range of sounds, voices, and perspectives.
    * Think about the questions or the mystery that your podcast will attempt to resolve
    * what do you want your listeners to know by the end of the episode?
    * what insights do you you want to share, or what responses from your audience do you want to provoke?
    * make some initial notes that will help you design your podcast as you select guests, music beds, and other important features of your podcast.
* Because podcasts are rich and engaging stories, it's important to plan your podcast episode thoroughly, building a narrative arc that structures your audio story
    * You can try writing out an audio storyboard for your podcast, noting the order, for instance, in which you might ask particular questions
    * or the types of sounds (music, effects, people speaking) and the order in which you anticipate using them
* One of the most popular storytelling devices that podcasts deploy is the interview, where guests and a host discuss a topic at length. 
    * a key way to prepare for this type of podcast is to share the topic and maybe even some broad questions that you'll discuss during the recording
    * taking this step of sending topics and even questions beforehand will help to avoid filler uhms, ahs, and thinking pauses that would need to be edited out later
    * it can also help folks prepare interesting anecdotes that they'd like to share, as a way of making their perspective on a given topic more concrete and relatable
### Structure Possibilities
Okay, so let's think about some of the different structures that common podcasts can take and how we might deploy certain structural elements in our podcast assignment.

Given the guidelines of your assignment, you'll likely utilize the structures incorporated into a more scripted podcast like This American Life, Radio Lab, Serial, or 99% Invisible. However it's worth noting, and perhaps mapping out the terrain so to speak, of the various structures of podcast that one might encounter:

some basic structures:
* **the scripted podcast.** these are written, revised, and rehearsed in advance of recording. Some models include
* [This American Life](https:///www.thisamericanlife.org/), [Radio Lab](https://radiolab.org/podcast/fellowship-tree-rings), [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one/6/the-case-against-adnan-syed), or [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/).
* **the improvised podcast.** much more spontaneous and conversational, unstructured and only perhaps rehearsed lightly. These almost verge into the form of a radio show. Some models include [The Joe Rogan Experience](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk), or [Armchair Expert](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/robert-sapolsky)
* **the monologic podcast.** simply, where a single host delivers the content, but it can still include the use of "primary source material" that they analyze and comment on. Some models include [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one/6/the-case-against-adnan-syed), and [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily).
* **the dialogic podcast.** Some models include [Armchair Expert](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/robert-sapolsky), [Radio Lab](https://radiolab.org/podcast/fellowship-tree-rings), and [Stuff You Should Know](https://omny.fm/shows/stuff-you-should-know-1/sysk-selects-how-guide-dogs-work).

a menu of source audio elements to incorporate:
* previously recorded **interviews** between the host(s) and their guest to prvide a lens of expertise or unique perspective on the content.
* **archive audio** or quoted clips from relevant sources, such as historical interviews or news casts.
* **sound effects**, **audio elements**, or **environmental sound** to emphasize key moments or provide authenticity to the moment in reference.
* **music bed** to set the tone and provide emphasis or punctuation to the content
* **silence**-so important to strategically use pauses or silence to also provide emphasis or to engage your listener in a moment of reflection or even anticipation.


approaches to "in the studio" audio, aka voice over aka narration:
* **narrative storytelling**, like This American Life that follows a typical tension to resolution story structure and guides the listener through the content.
* **dramatized scene** or a reenactment to provide context or to enhance the argument.
* **studio interview** or panel discussion

Hopefully this list of structures, source audio elements, and approaches on studio recordings will help you decide what to include in your own podcast assignment! Rememeber that you are not limited in choices, and many of the best podcasts are actually a mix of these.  For example, while you will, again given the scope of this assignment, draw more upon the scripted structure you can for sure think about ways to incoroporate a few moments of improvisation and ad lib to keep the cadence and tone of your speech engaging and conversational for the audience. 

## **Step 2: Gather Equipment**

### **Microphones:** **USB vs. XLR**
- **USB** microphones are convenient as they are plug-and-play, making them a solid choice for beginners.
- 	**XLR** microphones are often superior in terms of audio quality and can sometimes be cost-effective. However, they require an audio interface, which can add to the overall cost.

**Recommended USB Microphone:** [Blue Yeti USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Creators-Condenser-Microphone-988-000100/dp/B00N1YPXW2/ref=asc_df_B00N1YPXW2/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309707619534&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12375264689150081700&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001999&hvtargid=pla-361504918229&psc=1) or the [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=14IXS6ZNQECD6&keywords=shure%2Bmv7&qid=1695150081&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=sure%2BMV7%2Cmi%2C114&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
**Recommended XLR Microphone:** [RØDE PodMic](https://www.amazon.com/Versatile-Microphone-Connectivity-Podcasting-Music-Making/dp/B07MSCRCVK/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UP0Y87S3BR93&keywords=rode%2Bpodmic%2Busb&qid=1695149924&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=rode%2Bpod%2Cmi%2C107&sr=1-2&th=1) or the [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=14IXS6ZNQECD6&keywords=shure%2Bmv7&qid=1695150081&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=sure%2BMV7%2Cmi%2C114&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
**Recommended Audio Interfaces:** [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B0C5JRTS3Y/ref=sr_1_4?crid=29C16VBN74JA1&keywords=focusrite%2Bscarlett%2B2i2&qid=1695148951&s=musical-instruments&sprefix=focusrite%2Cmi%2C174&sr=1-4&th=1) or the [PreSonus AudioBox USB](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-AudioBox-USB-25th-Anniversary/dp/B08D8R6VFC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1).

### **Headphones:** 

When recording audio it is important to use headphones to monitor the way you sound. Use closed-back, over-ear headphones or in ear buds to monitor your audio during recording. This prevents sound leakage and interference. (Sound leakage refers to the audio coming out of your headphones and going back into your mic.)

## **Step 3: Set Up Your Space**

### **Handling Noise:**

- Choose a quiet room with minimal background noise. 
- If your computer fans are creating unwanted noise, try quitting unnecessary applications and webpages. 
- If you are conducting your interview using audio only, you may want to make a tent out of a blanket to record yourself under. While this may sound silly, it will really help to reduce echoes and improve sound quality.

---

### **Sound Check:**

- **Microphone Placement:** Position your microphone at mouth level and a few inches away from your mouth. Angle it slightly downward to minimize plosives (P and B sounds).

- **Mic Check:** Record a short test clip to check the microphone and audio levels. Adjust your microphone position and input levels if necessary.
- **Headphones Check:** Listen through your headphones for any background noise, interference, or issues with your microphone placement.

### **If You Are Using...**

#### Zoom Platform:
Zoom is a great option for recording remote podcasts, primarily for its familiarity. Inviting guests to a video call and starting the recording process is straightforward and user-friendly.

[Click here for a guide on how to record audio with Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings) (the recorded audio will be a .M4A file).

If you are on Zoom's free version and are hosting more than one guest in your online meeting, your recording can only last 40 minutes. You can bypass this by setting a timer and starting a new meeting. 

#### Digital Audio Workstation:
A DAW, like GarageBand or Logic Pro, is another great option for recording podcasts. While you will not be able to record guests remotely with it, a DAW will be essential if you need to join indivudual audio files together into one final mix.
After completing your recording, export that audio as either an .MP3 or .WAV.
    
Take a look at the supplied links below for more details on how to record using these DAWs:

- [Logic Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixZZMp7Nx80)
- [Audacity](https://riverside.fm/blog/audacity-for-podcasting#anchor4)
- [Audition](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/creating-podcasts.html)


#### Phone:

If the remote party cannot invest in equipment, they can record themselves using their phone's built-in recording app at the beginning of the interview.

- Ensure they are in a quiet, disturbance-free environment, as phone microphones won’t capture their voice as effectively as dedicated recording microphones would.
- The remote participant can then share their recording with you for further editing and integration into the podcast.

Google Drive, WeTransfer and/or AirDrop are solutions for sharing recordings. This way, you can bring it into a DAW of choice and combine all your audio assets into one final mix.

Take a look at the supplied links below for more details on how to record using these devices:

## Exporting and Publishing

Once you feel satisfied with your edit, its time to export the finished product. Podcasting has exploded in popularity in recent years, leaving you a plethora of social media/entertainment websites to publish to. When exporting your podcast, its always best to export it in a audio format widely accepted by most podcasting platforms. This includes formats such as .MP3, .WAV, and .M4A. 

### Publishing the Podcast

Some free website hosts that serve as solid platforms for hosting your podcast include:

- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) (Yes, YouTube indeed is a viable option for a podcast! Even if you do not plan on recording video alongside audio, you can simply use a still image for the duration of the podcast)

If you wish to pursure a larger website host, consider options such as:
- [Spotify for Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)
- [Apple Podcasts](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/login?targetUrl=%2F&authResult=FAILED)
- [iHeart Radio](https://podcasters.iheart.com/)

These hosts have more features to help with analytics and tracking, but may require an application submission, prerequisites and/or a subscription payment plan to use.
