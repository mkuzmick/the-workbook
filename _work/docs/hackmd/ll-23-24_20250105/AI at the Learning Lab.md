# AI at the Learning Lab

As one of many initiatives at Harvard University, the Learning Lab has been exploring AI's utility in various disciplines and developing possible applications of generative AI in courses at the College.

## GAICAS

The Learning Lab has hired a group of Generative AI Course Assistants to help Harvard College courses integrate AI. GAICAs are developing custom tutor bots that students in a course can interact with and that are trained on that course's content. Leveraging the Learning Lab's unique studio capacities, GAICAs are exploring emergent multimodal tools, from the image-generation and altering tools offered by Adobe, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to the newer OpenAI APIs that work with speech and images.

### Slavic 191: Silent Film

To explore the medium of film through the practice of making *and* analyzing it, students in Slavic 191: Silent Film came to the Learning Lab for an interactive workshop that deployed different elements of silent film. Students examined stills from different silent films they had watched in the course, creating their own intertitles on large black pieces of paper to describe and analyze the shot composition, framing, camera angles, and lighting of different scenes. At the same time, the speech to text Open AI API Whisper was used to take what students were saying outloud and generate digital intertitles on the spot that had the students' insights on them. 

### TDM 98 Junior Tutorial

In TDM 98 Junior Tutorial, students created their own custom chatbots in an experimental Slack channel and design an improvised drama.

### CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship

In CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship, students developed pitch videos for their entrepreneurial projects. They began with a business model canvas and received feedback from Hunt Lambert, which was then used to train an OpenAI bot. This bot provided additional, nuanced feedback on their pitches.

### CompLit 200: Computing Fantasy: Imagination, Invention, Radical Pedagogy (Munari / Rodari / Calvino)

Students will use basic Python notebooks connected to an Open AI API to generate folktales. This activity aligns with the course goal of interrogating the relationship between computing and story generation.

### EMR 162: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Race and Artificial Intelligence

Students will come to the Learning Lab to get an "under the hood" experience of working with generative AI and examining how these tools actually work.

### EMR 163: Asian American Graphic Narratives

Students will come to the Learning Lab for an interactive workshop that integrates AI into the comic book production process. 

### ENG 189VG: Video Game Storytelling

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F06JZFEP9D1/benham_sdgif.gif?pub_secret=e1a16e6e86)

Students will learn about possible ways to integrate AI into the video game production process, such as making visual assets or designing characters.

### GOV94OL: Artificial Intelligence: Sociolegal Dilemmas and Policy Design

Students experimented with using Python notebooks connected to Open AI's API to generate images and data visualizations for data storytelling.

## Department Support

### Art, Film, and Visual Studies AI Glossary

Media & Design Fellow Julia Sharpe is creating an AI glossary for AFVS faculty that will provide an overview of the range of tools that can be used in the image production process. 

## Harvard University Initiatives

### Harvard Initiative on Learning and Teaching Annual Conference: Teaching in the Age of AI
Christine D'Auria (Assistant Director of the Learning Lab) and Media & Design Fellows Anna Ivanov (Slavic) and Siriana Lundgren (Music) participated in a panel on Student Perspectives on Generative AI, as part of the Harvard Initiative on Learning and Teaching annual conference.
