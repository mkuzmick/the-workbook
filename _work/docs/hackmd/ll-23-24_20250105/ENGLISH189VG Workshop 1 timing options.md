# ENGLISH189VG Workshop 1 timing options

If we want to do the same thing as last year (1 hour and 15 minutes per slot with a 30-minute overlap, and up to 20 students per slot),


1.  1:30 PM - 2:45 PM
2.  2:00 PM - 3:15 PM
3.  2:30 PM - 3:45 PM
4.  3:00 PM - 4:15 PM
5.  3:30 PM - 4:45 PM
6.  4:00 PM - 5:15 PM
7.  4:30 PM - 5:45 PM


OR 

1.  4:30 PM - 5:45 PM
2.  5:00 PM - 6:15 PM
3.  5:30 PM - 6:45 PM
4.  6:00 PM - 7:15 PM
5.  6:30 PM - 7:45 PM
6.  7:00 PM - 8:15 PM
7.  7:30 PM - 8:45 PM


different ideas -
* we want a maximum of 40 students here at any given moment
* 130 students
* each person rotates out in 75 minutes
* 5 stations at 15 minutes a station


15 minute slots that each take 8 names
* we should be exploring tools that do things like this (finding different scheduling tools - ask. mw)
* [dd mock up the spreadsheet - figure out when the first group would begin, when the last would end, if it's 8 people per slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n-per40dSBV7QE9BbdlyF5PFc8japMjMGcw60jqdHAk/edit#gid=1255275774)


if we did 10 people every 15 minutes, we're getting 40 people per hour. 2-6:30-ish 
if we did 8 people per group, it would be a little longer...

## messy notes
things to think about
* how many experiences should students have
    * how many sations are mandatory and how are many are optional
* staffing

to dos
* finding basic resources on overviews of the game development process, and the game industry
    * these are great to have available for folks to check out, this will help us design the thing

chris - 3d stuff

think about integrating processed media - on the green screen they get to be inside a video game? connect to AI/stable diffusion? 

unity or unreal thing with making yourself as a video game character

having a couple of cool moonshot ideas connected to JS course or other course

we can also find some readings to associate with the stations
* venues from the schell book as connected to game controllers (moving forward or leanig back, etc.)


### mk slacks
* the vision is a series of stations where they encounter all of the elements of the game design process/system as outlined, for instance, in Unity's documentation on video game design
* so, for instance  
    -   a station on modeling
    -   a station on texturing
    -   a station on inspector-based manipulation of a Unity scene
    -   a station on code-base manipulation of a Unity scene
    -   at least one station devoted to AI (maybe for the 3d end or maybe for realistic NPC dialogue generation say)
    -   arts and crafts stations on story structure/trees/forking-systems
    -   a station devoted to input devices
- all the assets
    - sound effects
    - music
    - 3d models of characters
    - rigging for characters
    - animations for characters
    - other 3d assets
    - textures and materials
    - forking/tree/looping/conditional story structures
    - database backends for stories
    - database backends for tracking user moves
    - coding (in Unity, or for web)
    - 2d assets
    - paper prototyping
    - ai
        - for texturing
        - for npc character generation
        - for character-look generation
        - for story generation
    - input devices
        - grab all the game controllers we find and have them out there
            - phone
            - ipad
            - computer
            - occulus
            -
