# CE10 Storytelling and Public Speaking Workshop at the Learning Lab

We're so excited to have you in for a workshop on Wednesday, October 25, 9-11:45am!

## Asks
Please -
* take a look at the resources & models below before our session together.
* bring in the most updated version of your business model canvas.


### Resources & Models
* watch [this iconic pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndnmtz8-S5I). Notice how the visual and the oral elements work together, without one distracting from the other, but rather supporting each other. Note this idea of a "visual home base" demonstrated here. We may get you to try to come up with your own visual home base during the workshop.
* take a look at some of these [pitch decks](https://pitch.com/blog/15-great-pitch-decks-from-successful-startups). What patterns do find emerging among them? What do they have in common? What is (or sometimes, isn't) "working" for you? Was there one that stood out to you more than the others? We may ask you to try to articualte why it stood out to you when you come in.
* watch this [talk on communicating your ideas through storytelling structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk). It will give you some great framing and preparation for what we will be workshopping togetheron the 25th.
