#### Visual Summary:

- alluvial plot animation that includes following a single case within a more abstract 
- slides with quotes
- photos: subtle shift from desaturated, harsh crushed blacks at beginning to more saturated in the end
- The visual structure might be: 
    - prisons -> data -> uplifting photos of humans.
#### Topic Summary:

Her research involves interviews and questionairres over time to see how being born during a motherâ€™s incarceration impact's a child's development. 

#### Prompts:
* ideas for alluvial animation
* ideas for font pairings for quotes

#### Visual Summary
- She has a bunch of nice visuals already but we are waiting on permissions for them. We will try to get a data set from her that we can work with.
- vignette of the community of astronomers, from the technical aspects (robots catching light) to outreach
- links:
    - [DESI cosmic web planetarium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYKUb05mnPk)
    - <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYKUb05mnPk?si=e83Hu4S4OTqh_Ojc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Topic Summary
As part of a huge collaboration of scientists, she is making a map of the unvierse based on this evolving web-like structure made of dark matter, dark energy, and galaxies. 

#### next steps
- MK + JK will meet with her

Prompts:
- RSD ideas
- IA ideas
- collaboration vignette

#### Visual Summary

- maybe film in clean room
- laser visuals (either cohesive keynote work or a slick animation...or maybe a combo of both using the new keynote 3D asset update)


#### Topic Summary

He develops super tiny energy efficient devices for carrying quantum information. On a  nanoscale, he works to improve the  technology for quantum information. He made a device that trapped certain exictons (electron + electron hole) and produced a laser which acts a qubit (the quantum information carrier). Now he's working on fabricating the hardware structures to control these qubits.  


#### next steps:

Prompts:
* [HH Visual: Dylan - Laser](/59xHDxPrRCeliYPrg84QDg)
* ways of visualizing lasers between anodes and cathodes 
* boxes, cubes, and 3D schematics ideas
### Heidi

-   [Heidi's Pinterest](https://pin.it/26qPrHzml)

Prompts:
* ways of visualizing the structure of PFAS
* Ideas for showing part of a chemical structure degrading or decaying

#### Visual Summary
- Primarily Keynote animations with photos and text.
- we filmed her taking the test this week 
- Uchida-Kraepelin test portion printed maybe

#### Topic Summary
Her research centers on a test that was developed by someone in Japan and someone in Germany int he early 1900s. It is all about adding pairs of numbers in rows to a timer, and then looking at the line that is made when you connect the points you got to in each row. Apparently this measures someone's intelligence, but also their "true self" because it is designed to get you to be in a state balanced between bored and attentive. So she will present us with this ostensibly meaningless thing, let us dwell on it for a bit, and then reveal all of the amazing stuff hidden beneath this thing.





#### next steps:
- get a rough edit and stills from her 20240207 filming of taking the test on Wed. 
- JK work with her on Friday worktime on keynote moves: img-to-text, text animation
### Mauro

- [Mauro's Pinterest](https://pin.it/1NrYBD0Rw)
#### Visual Summary
- primarily keynote work
- more full screen & structured views of poem
- try a ken burns move on the painting

#### Topic Summary
He examines how artists & writers speak to the loss of human rights of refugees, specifically around WWII Latin America.

#### next steps:
- JK work with him on Friday worktime on keynote: structure of photos, ken burns of painting


### Noah

-   [Noah's Pinterest](https://pin.it/3iez8iMLF)
#### Visual Summary
- potential physical thing 
- we will film the thing that he takes on stage
#### Topic Summary
They are designing "tessagami" strucutures based on origami and specifically a scissor mechaism that lets you take flat surfaces and create 3 dimensional forms with them
#### next steps:
- work on the blender learning prompt for the scissor mechanism
