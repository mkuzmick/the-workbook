# documentation prompt
This term, we're going to go all-in on documenting our learning, looking toward a final end of year event where we tell the story of what we did at the LL and why we did it. There are two central components of this project: documenting as you go and exhibiting your learning process so that it's legible and meaningful to others. 

## documenting as you go

Document your progress each time you work on it, even if that's a couple times a week. The more documentation, the better!

### key terms
* documenting
* charting
* collecting
* compiling
* listing
* assembling
* indexing

### what documentation is
Documenting and charting your process as you go is a consistent, present-oriented practice. In this sense, documentation means regularly capturing your learning process:
* taking images, screen captures, sound recordings/voice memos, of your progress each time you work
    * can you use non-textual means to capture the environment in which you were working (including your computer screen!)
    * what did you *do*
    * what did you look at
    * you could think about using AI here to help you generate visual, audio, etc. assets that relate to your learning process
* writing up notes and reflections on what you worked on during that chunk of time
    * include step-by-step descriptions when it makes sense
    * note challenges and things that went well
    * note what is next
    * note how much time it took 
    * you could also use AI tools here (say, to turn audio into text using OpenAI's whisper API)
* maybe making tags or doing some form of preliminary curating/listing/sorting that helps you think about each step in the process as part of a larger whole 


You can use ```#ll-show-your-work``` and hackMD to keep a record of your process. Think of hackMD as a project journal that you reflect in every time you work on this project.

## exhibiting your learning process
At the end of the term, we'll create galleries that tell the story of our process and the final project.

### key terms
* curating
* cataloguing
* exhibiting
* anthologizing
* storytelling

### metacognition + curation
Reflecting on your process entails curating key touchstones of your learning from your documentation. This practice involves both looking backward---to make sense of what you did---and forward, as your curation enables future/would-be learners to learn from you.

Take all of those documented moments and curate them into a meaningful story about what you learned and, more importantly, **how you learned it**. 

This could involve:
* recording a final reflection video in the LL studio
* using AI to help you with the curation process, prompting it to help you categorize your different documentation materials into meaningful chunks 
* writing a longer-form story about your project, like the sort of metacognitive essay you might assign to students
