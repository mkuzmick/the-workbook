# ll-event-lab-taster-script-20230814
## taster ideas
- Fake Final Event! What is this-- Academic Performance as a Rock and Roll Show: 200-500 words of academic content as a rock star. 
    - one large scale manipulation to the studio
    - Green screen 
    - PA system
    - Music bed (loops, learning how music/improvisation affects academic improv)
    - Code
- so a number of discrete learning experiences (2-3 minutes each) that build up to the larger scale final capstone event that Siriana will perform at

## Welcome to Event Lab
### Introdution
Today, we'll be putting on your first event in the Learning Lab. Don't worry, before we get there, we're going to learn the basics, but by the end of our time together, we'll learn how to run the systems of our magical little lab. 

The format we'll be using is one that will become familiar to you over time-- we're following the trajectory of a workshop that coalesces into a major performance. Here's our theme for the day: 

An Academic Presentation of a 200 word paragraph as a Cinematic Rock Show

In our taster, we'll be learning just three of the major mechanics EventLab uses to put on our workshops. But it can also show you just how much can be done with these three mechanics. 

## Event Outline
### Opening Discussion (5 min)
- What is the "event" of teaching and learning?
    - What are the actual physical elements involved in this space? 
    - What are the additional mechanics that the LL can offer for teaching and learning? 
- What makes a good event? 
    - How does an event engage the senses? 
    - how does an event engage the emotions? 

- What can we do to put on an event in the LL? 
    - Code 
    - Movement (of space and of ourselves)
    - Tangible takeaways
    - ATEM

- How can we turn something like Chris's Video Essay into a live event? 
    - Music Bed Layer
    - Performance Layer
    - Visual Layer

### Station 1: Put images on the Green Screen (10 min)
- Pulling from images in the Western Acoutrements Google Drive, edit together a sequence of photos and clips to use behind the speaker.(would this take too long?) 
    - let's do both printed and digital images to show them that both are possible, and potentially to talk a bit about the pros and cons of each.

### Station 2: Learn how to run Audio Loops (10 min)
- learn how to press play on an audio loop. 
- practice choosing the right loop for the mood and sensing shifts in performances. Use a practice text (academic or otherwise) for participants to read to help understand this feeling.
    - Q=do we need a text by now? will Siriana be improvising?
    - or should MK be improvising on Events
        - like a series of quotable quotes on events

### Station 3: Presence (10 min)
- Breathing exercises 
- Then a rousing game of "Portrait" 
    - Divide students into groups of 3 or 4 and give them "poses" to re-enact on stage as a small portrait group. We'll then take a snapshot. 
        - Portrait of Royalty from the 16th Century Getting Angry with their Portrait Artist 
        - Family Beach Vacation Gone Wrong 
        - Three Overenergetic Children being Unsuccesfully Wrangled for the Yearly Family Photo
        - Undergraduates coming to the learning lab for the first time
        - Learning How to Use Blender for the First Time

### Final Performance (5 min)
- After we've run through all the stations, we will rehearse and then perform! 

### Concluding Discussion (5 min)
What are the mechanics we used in the LL today? 
- Which do you envision using in a future workshop? How will you use it? 
- What made the mechanics we explored today effective/ineffective?



## mk questions for siriana:

could we split the group for the first two steps? with one focusing on sight and one on sound?

- marlon does loops and gets people to share some of their ideas about events, teaching and learning from the opening discussion
- while siriana teaches them to switch and greenscreen, and they create both foreground and background elements for the performer on stage? (i.e. background elements = the "set" or environment; foreground elements = more frequently the data or argument the speaker is discussing). We could continue to make events the theme here. Like visual brainstorming of what an event of learning should/could be, what its elements might be

it's cool if everyone is on one topic, because that way accidental connections will be meaningful rather than random. But we split in two and rotate them maybe?
