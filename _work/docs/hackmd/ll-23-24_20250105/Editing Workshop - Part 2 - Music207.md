## The Nuts and Bolts

Once you have footage in the editor, you can finally start doing the core functions of editing. This is done dominently in the Sequence pane -- this is the timeline in which you'll assemble your edit. 

Start with double clicking your footage in your Project pane, this will show in the Source window -- this will always show your original footage. 

Play your footage back, and when you find the START of a clip you'd like to start assembling with, press "I" on your keyboard, this will set your In Point. Next, play the video and when you reach the point you want your clip to stop, hit "O" on your keyboard. This will set your Out Point. 

Finally, to start adding these to your timeline, press your "comma" key. This will Insert your clip into your timline. It's important to note that it will end up wherever your timeline

## Color Correction

Often times cameras don't interpret color the way we'd hope they would. This can be addressed to some extent in camera, using the White Balance functions, but many cameras these days required you to correct or grade in post-production. 

It's pretty self explanatory, but corrections address active issues, while grades amplify footage you're already happy with. Often times editors will want to increase the contrast, boost certain colors, or even remove color spectrums to help design your work. 

At the very least, it's good to know how to adjust video that isn't quite balanced. Most editors have an option to shift your footage along the warm/cold spectrum. In Premiere, this is found within the **Color** workspace, in the **Basic Correction** pane. 

## Keyframing Animations

Keyframing is a method of adjusting variables over time. This can be anything Opacity to Volume, Position, Scale, Rotation, etc. With almost any effect you have control over in Premiere, it allows you to animate them. This is the basics of animations, motion graphics and audio mastering. 

For simple, frequently accessed variables, you can find these on the clips in your timeline, itself. If it's not showing up, select the **Wrench** icon in the **Sequence** and choose "Show Video Keyframes". These white lines that show up in your timeline are representative of the Opacity, if on a video clip, and Volume, if on an audio clip. 

Alternatively, if you open the Effect Control pane, you can select the "Stopwatch" next to the variables you find there. The confusing part is that the Stopwatch is toggle -- so you have to select it to set your first keyframe, but you have to select the Dot to the left of it for any keyframes past the first one -- and you always need at least 2 keyframes to make any changes. 

## Exporting

When you finish up your video -- or just want to host it on a platform for other folks to take a look at it! You'll be exporting it to a file, that you can then upload to Youtube/Vimeo/Drive/etc. 

There is a Quick Export option, that's incredibly quick and simple to use. I recommend to Match Source - Adaptive High Bitrate, which is a good, all-purpose, format. The world of codecs, though are massively various, complex, and in many cases, somewhat esoteric. If you're curious about diving into it, there is a link attached below.
