# MUSIC29.F23.Multimedia Essay Workshop-planning time

## messy notes
[most recent consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U3MDbkTCzcbGPzPo0Cm8hH6irnR9TfD-1a1CxNQ8t6Y/edit)

after they go through a number of stations, the groups would do a live pitch of their project+ rationale. and what we see on screen is a live video essay-ish (someone playing music, someone speaking, doing things under the overhead, etc)

station ideas
* music zone, with logic and microphones set up (throwing in quick tips on microphones)
* main table station about content structure and word/visualization of what they're doing
    * key words
    * core visuals
    * spatial representation
* animation station to recreate something from the video that was unpacked 
* DAW station
* using physical props or art supplies (like yarn) to demonstrate something meaningful about the music. prompt is to show us something visually and spatially about the music
* chris's music visualization in blender - analytical
    * potentially digital tools station where they get a range of ways - colorblocks in canva and spectograms and all the way up to vr/ar things. this could be one of those things. just an overview of how you can think about putting visualizations of music together
    * they should play around with making at the station

mk said it could be phases instead of just stations - everyone could work on X, and then X, and then put things together

bring in more instruments for that day. music zone, visuals zone, speaking zone

the goal is for them to develop a pitch
visualization tools - table + graphics station


their final presentation has to include a musical component, a graphical element, and someone talking. going from station to station to try to check those boxes



| Time | Action |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| 00:05     |  Icebreaker: Music Album    | 
| 00:15     |  Unpacking 1-2 video essays    | 
| 00:05     |  Explanation of Prompt + Stations    | 
| 01:00     |  Stations    |  
| 00:5     |  work time for finalizing pitches    | 
| 00:30     |  Pitches    | 


flow
* maybe icebreaker
* start out by unpacking 1-2 video essays (15-20 minutes) - CHRIS will choose and do this part
* prompt- go from station to station to be able to put together the pieces that puts together their pitch
* stations: 2 big stations
    * sight (visualizing music) - CHRIS sets this up
        * main table prototyping and graphical elements
        * digital visuals
        * very quick playing around with the cameras 
    * sound - JK
        * pitch/voice
        * DAWs + PA + Instruments
(half an hour per team in each big station, 15 minutes in each mini station.)
* a little work time to finalize their pitches + get materials
* then they perform their pitches (2 minute pitches)


mk wants a checklist or callsheet - by showtime, they need to know what their physical visuals are, digital visualizations, what they're saying, who's saying what, if there will be music accompaniement, etc.
* jk think about this


dd will put timeline in a workshop doc and sending to chris.
print up some key frames of the video models chris chooses
