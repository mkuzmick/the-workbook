As you'll read on our [website](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab), the Bok Centerâ€™s **Learning Lab** is an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. We meet with faculty to consult with them about their objectives, then we design and prototype new assignments, activities and resources for their courses. The designing and testing is performed by our staff of 
- 7 full-time employees
- 14 Media and Design Fellows (graduate students who work 10 hours per week to support teaching innovations in their home departments using the resources of the Learning Lab)
- 20 Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (LLUFs) who function as "play-testers" as we prototype (giving us feedback and new ideas), and then when the assignments and activities get launched during the term they frequently function as peer tutors and instructors for students enrolled in the courses we support
- 5 Media Production Assistants 

Most of the projects we support encourage students to learn and present their ideas in new media: video essay assignments, podcasts, infographics, oral presentations, and more. But students are not merely learning *to* create in these media; they are learning *through* filming, podcasting, 3d-modeling, and so on. These new media are, like academic writing, important forms through which students can grapple with a course's material and, crucially, they are tools for *building and making* things with the data and theories and concepts and histories they are learning.

You can also read more about us in a [book chapter we wrote](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/news/new-bok-center-publication-learning-lab) that documents the launch of the Learning Lab and says a bit more about our process.

You can find many images of our 50 Church St Studio on [our Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boklearninglab/albums/72157688059831350). But you are also welcome to stop by--just email learninglab@fas.harvard.edu if you are ever in town.



## Harvard Horizons

Each year the Learning Lab supports a group of 8 PhD students selected by Harvard's Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as they develop the skills and visual assets required to deliver 5-8 minute presentations on their research.

## Examples of student work

Many of the courses we support involve capstone media assignments such as videos, podcasts, 3D virtual museums, posters and performances. Here are some examples of student work from students who have given us permission to share their work.
