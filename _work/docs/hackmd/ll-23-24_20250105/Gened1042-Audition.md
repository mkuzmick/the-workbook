#### To import audio...
- Create a new Multitrack session by selecting 'Multitrack' on the top left corner
- Select: File > Import > File (CMD + I)
	- OR Simple double click in the "Files" Pane
- Drag & drop your audio asset from the Files browser onto an empty track inside the timeline

#### To split audio regions...
- Move the playhead to where you want to create a split
	- Press 'CMD + K'
		- Remember to select the audio region you want to split
- Alternatively, 'R' will turn your cursor into the Razor tool, allowing you to cut wherever you click. 
	- Press 'V' to return to your selection tool

#### To create automation lines...
- Inside the Editor panel of a track, click the small arrow to the left of 'Read'; a light yellow line will appear underneath your audio
	- Click the light yellow line to add an automation point (blue diamond shape) on it. Repeat to add more.
	- Drag one up or down to create a fade in/out
- Or, the Hard-Mode version is to change that "Read" to "Write", and adjust your volume as you play it back. 
	- This will record all of the adjustments as keyframes.
