# 2024-end-of-year-LL-event-initial-notes

* [last year's planning book for reference](https://hackmd.io/@ll-22-23/BkNHAS-4n/%2F4aaygw9HR2OxXqV-dd8_PQ)

## cd initial notes
may event 
* mdfs invite friends
* interested people from their depts
* event craft - me, dd, jk; what chunk would faculty come for, fellows hour, faculty hour, happy hour; when would new mdfs come; when LLUFs/undergrads would leave (happy hour)
* we’ll invite the whole bok center
* think about invitation list with dd - ask MDFs to source people 
* mw make invitation that MDFs can share with friends and their depts, we can share with faculty 
* narrative around the event: end of the year celebration/reception that will also involve show and tells about some of the work we did this year
* it’s not like you have to come for two hours, you can stop by for a few minutes, grab a drink and snack
* fair/expo/etc. 
* possible flow 
    * 3 pm: all fellows
    * 4 pm: Bok center, faculty, new MDFs
    * 5 pm: happy hour

## dd and cd notes
* maybe 3-5pm for the full event, with drinks and snacks the whole time. showcase/science-fair style
* whoever wants to stay for karaoke, etc. does that starting at 5/we kind of shift to games or something

### to ask
* mk - do we really need a private/fellows only time? 
* mk/jk - how early should other fellows start preparing for this? (mdfs have already started talking about this!)
* tb/lm about undergrads around when alc is out
* tb/lm for bok friends list that the holiday card has been sent to, as a starting place for invitees
* mw to prototype a few invitation ideas
* cd ask mdfs to think of faculty and friends they'd want to invite


## more things to think about from mk
* schedule moments when pulling focus 
* there is a level of micro orchestration that should happen if we are going to have moments when people come
* thinking through performance-y pull focus things we want
* how many are constantly manned (presentation station, vs. being an attendee)
* 4 corners of the space on 4 big themes? 

## more notes
* getting end of year interviews
* really focus on showing things that clients have asked for / have benefited clients (as opposed to learning projects)
* fellows program can be represented
* celebration of what the LL fellows have done this year - that's the narrative. celebration of an internal community, you're welcome as a member of this community.

## areas of focus
* ai/code
    * 3d/stable diffusion/chris
    * slavic silent film + ballet/anna

    * siriana - lead us in an activity on the hour? or she's kind of our emcee the whole time?

## pulling focus
* on the hour
    * each corner does a quick demo - 1 person so they could be there at different times
* siriana does a little spiel on the hour each time
