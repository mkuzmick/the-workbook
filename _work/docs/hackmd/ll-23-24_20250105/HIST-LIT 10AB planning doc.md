    * or [this vox one about xmas trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AUAPRvNrgk) for an "object in its context approach" with found footage, images, etc.
* think about different shot types
    * write down a bunch of cards
    * have them think about when you'd deploy a particular shot length, how you'd cope with light in space, framing, etc. 
* with arts supplies, media (using greenscreen), props, print outs of objects
    * design a 2-minute presentation about your object
    * think about the story element
    * and the visuals
    * tension to resolution
    * x because of y
    * excitement!
    * what do you want us to learn (maybe it's 3 things, maybe it's one thing but shown across a handful of objects as object case studies, etc.)
* presentations
* quick editing tips in 
    * canva
    * maybe fcpx? premiere?
