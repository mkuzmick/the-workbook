# eventLab Event Processing Workflow

## background
*How do we set the workshop leaders up for success? we want to develop more patterns around our usual 'nice to haves'*

## Feature Requests
* Intro to a workshop - really quickly getting that as a handout, and then a printed version that looks good for students to leave with even
* Post workshop debrief+reflection recording to doc
* constant transcripts throughout, moved and stored to folder dedicated to workshop?
* clearer audio for all speakers


## mk notes

- for live recording, engineer multiviews without frames or overlays
- 

## Messy notes
* dynamic mics so we're getting more voices (and maybe some differentiated mics that are explicitly NOT recorded)
* initial products that we want to churn out every time
* mk and dd run through projects and tasks and get transcript to action doc with tasks or something out of that recording
* single core image or mechanic that we force people to commit to - and if that's clear, that can way more freedom to go crazy.
    * think about how we construct the technoloigcal infrastructure of complex events, as a way to think about event processing
* continue to refine the workshop planning meetings being recorded to getting AI's help making a plan
    * structuring the meeting/conversation
    * prompting the AI - the perfect things to ask to get the plan
* perfect things to ask after a workshop to get the project report
