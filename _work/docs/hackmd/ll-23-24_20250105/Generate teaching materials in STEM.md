            prompt used: "teaching material for a class, a diagram of early marine life"

## description
Instructors can use AI tools like chatGPT to help them develop preliminary ideas about course content (such as course topics), the organization of course modules, and ideas about the types of materials that students could engage with throughout the course. It could also be used to generate ideas about class-specific activities, especially if one prompts the AI to respond to the recent topics covered in the course and to structure an activity around those topics.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4.
    *  We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

3. Ask chatGPT to help you prepare a 75 minute active-learning class about a topic of your choosing (we'll do dynamic equilibrium as our example). Make sure you specify that you'd like chatGPT to map out the chunks of time you should spend on each topic.
4. Ask a follow up question like: In that 10-minute segment on ____, what three points should I be sure I hit?
5. Ask another follow-up question: What are activities I could do that would help students understand this topic?
