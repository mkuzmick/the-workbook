            prompt used: "Visualize code and pinpoint syntax errors, providing tips for debugging and troubleshooting."
            
## description
GAI: Students can use an AI tool to assist with debugging computer code, a process that involves identifying and fixing errors or 'bugs' in a program. The AI tool can be programmed to understand a variety of programming languages, from Python to JavaScript, and can provide real-time feedback and troubleshooting tips to students as they work through their coding tasks.

For instance, if a student is working on a Python coding project and encounters an error, they can input their code into the AI tool. The AI can then scan the code, identify syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors, and highlight these for the student. The AI can also provide explanations for these errors, helping the student understand why the error occurred and how to fix it.

In addition to identifying errors, the AI tool can also suggest improvements to the code. It can point out areas where the code could be made more efficient, or where best practices are not being followed. This can help students not only to fix their code, but also to improve their coding skills and develop good coding habits.

Furthermore, the AI tool can be used to reinforce learning. Once a student has debugged their code, the AI can generate additional, similar coding tasks with intentional errors, challenging the student to apply their debugging skills.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for debugging code, it is important to ensure that students are not overly reliant on it. Debugging is a skill that requires critical thinking and problem-solving, and it is important for students to develop these skills themselves. Therefore, educators may want to set guidelines for when and how the AI tool should be used, to ensure that it is enhancing, not hindering, the learning process.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
