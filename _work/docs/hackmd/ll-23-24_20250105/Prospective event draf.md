BCC: student emails
Subject line: Invitation from the Learning Lab

Hello,

We hope this email finds you well. We're writing to invite you to a special pop-up event on Monday, November 27th, 5-7pm with the Learning Lab's director, Marlon, and assistant director, Jordan, who runs the Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows Program.

This will be an opportunity to learn skills in some of the tools we work with, and for us to get to know you and your interests a bit more before we begin reviewing applications in December for our Spring 2024 LLUF cohort. 

Please let us know if you plan to attend and if you have any dietary restrictions, as we'll be providing food.

We're looking forward to hearing from you!

All best,
Dani
