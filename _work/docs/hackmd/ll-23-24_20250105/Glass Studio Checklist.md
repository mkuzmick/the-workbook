# Glass Studio Checklist
- [ ] Collect supplies or materials left in the room and put them in their correct place/jar
- [ ] Leave things like plants/bean bags/decor objects, but keep everything organized
- [ ] remove any rolly chairs or stools from the room and place them in a space where they are used more often
- [ ] Leave camera and light setups as they are, but loose or misplaced equipment can be put on the table(s) in STORAGE ROOM 2 if there is no active shoot/setup  
- [ ] Make sure there are magnets and markers for the dry erase board in that room
- [ ] Use cleaner and paper towels to wipe down the window facing the open space
