## dates for sophie for footage collecting
we want to make sure:
1.  that we have proxies for each and every angle from these days?
2.  load them up on a 2TB drive if they will fit?

(check these dates+all day recordings from relevant days)
(less crucial to copy proxy from student recording dates)

### slavic191
SLAVIC 191: Silent Film  
In SLAVIC 191: Silent Film, students utilized OpenAI's Whisper API for live transcriptions during their live video essays. This integration offered a novel approach to analyzing silent films, like "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." The AI-generated silent film-style title cards, created in response to students' interpretations, enriched their learning experience, providing a deeper insight into the nuances of silent film production and analysis.

* To explore the medium of film through the practice of making _and_ analyzing it, students in Slavic 191: Silent Film came to the Learning Lab for an interactive workshop that deployed different elements of silent film. Students examined stills from different silent films they had watched in the course, creating their own intertitles on large black pieces of paper to describe and analyze the shot composition, framing, camera angles, and lighting of different scenes. At the same time, the speech to text Open AI API Whisper was used to take what students were saying outloud and generate digital intertitles on the spot that had the students’ insights on them. At another station, students explored camera work, blocking, and acting, thinking about the capabilities of cameras and how camera positioning and framing shape the film’s narrative or convey an actor’s subjectivity. A third station used a green screen and cameras to project ink-drawn film sets made by students in the style of German expressionist films like Dr. Caligari. Students then devised scenes to enact in front of their film set. Through this workshop, students gained significant fist-hand experience working with the form, learning about the relationship between form and content through the act of making a silent film.

### FRSEMR36G

Students in The Creative Work of Translating look at different types of translation, as well as the different ways that translation happens. During the week when students were examining translation across media, they came to the Learning Lab for a workshop about using different media to translate–from text to the voice, from the voice to the body, from text and voice to image, from moving to still image. Students rotated through stations that allowed them to practice these types of translations. By the end of the sesion, students had made their own translations of the same texts, culminating in a collaborative, layered translation, with students’ voices, musical compositions, gestures, and images integrating into a group translation of the text. Students also had the opporunity to try out some ideas for their final projects and to get feedback on those ideas.

### CE10
CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship  
In CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship, students developed pitch videos for their entrepreneurial projects. They began with a business model canvas and received feedback from Hunt Lambert, which was then used to train an OpenAI bot. This bot provided additional, nuanced feedback on their pitches, offering a unique interactive learning experience. Despite some challenges in fine-tuning the AI, this approach added significant value to the students' entrepreneurial understanding and project development.

### tdm98
TDM 98 Junior Tutorial
In TDM 98 Junior Tutorial, students were introduced to the innovative world of AI and generative AI. They had the opportunity to code their own bots and create an improvised drama within a dedicated experimental Slack channel. This activity not only taught them about AI design and engineering but also provided a unique perspective on how skills from non-coding disciplines can be applicable in cutting-edge technological fields. The hands-on experience with AI in this tutorial led to unexpected learning outcomes and creative discoveries.
