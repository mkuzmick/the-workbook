## Reality Lab Intro activity (polygons make up the world)

### 1. Shapes (CHRIS) (15ish min)
- Hand out paper shapes/blocks
- Ask participants to look at their shapes and think what they could make. Look around the room, here are some examples (chess pieces, fidgets, person, etc.)or find your own! 
    - Get up and move around (maybe in pairs)
    - Its not about looking exactly like it. Just uncovering its "essence"

- Share out any people are proud of/excited about

### 2. BLENDER (and more shapes) (SOPHIE?) (10 min explain, 20 min practice.)
- Blender file on each computer (in Slack)
    - already shapes in or teach how to make shapes?
- Quick intro on how to move around in Blender (Pan, Grab, Rotate, Scale) (10 min or less)
- Using these shapes, try to recreate what you made out of blocks.
    - Want a challenge? Make this figure (its all spheres and cyllinders)
    - **Sophie build on screen and Chris circle to help.**
