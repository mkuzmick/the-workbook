## Preliminary MK/MW Notes


* MW: 
    * Jōsh has a great background in philosophy and ontology, but is also generally strong in CS. I think he should dock with the COMPLIT200 course, and help gonzalo and Josefina quickly finish our laundry list of simple "singles," and then help brainstorm for specialized single functions of the course specifically to help us create fairytale-generating "maachines." 
        * I can absolutely imagine him doing a PhD with Schnapp one day, so I think he is highly motivated.
