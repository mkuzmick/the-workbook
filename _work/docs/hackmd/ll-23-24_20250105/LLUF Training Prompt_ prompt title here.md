# LLUF Training: Event Processing (Samara)

## Background

As the term winds down, we'll be teaching fellows and staff to perform the tasks they'll be performing next term (if they don't already know how to do them--if they DO know how to do them then they can help us produce instructions and training for others).

### Elements & Tools

Let's try to itemize the toolset Samara would like to learn here, then we can learn at least one of these things on each shift:

- Switchers, Recorders, System
    - ATEM Constellation 8K Switcher
    - ATEM 4ME Switcher
    - Hyperdecks and Computers and Drives for recording
    - Basics of the signal flow
    - Small Studio recording
- Software & Post
    - OBS
    - ATEM Software Control and Setup App
    - Videohub Software Control and Setup App
    - Live-still-and-gif workflow
- Physical Objects
    - buttons
    - boxes
    - cards


We can delete any of these that aren't relevant.


### Deliverable
