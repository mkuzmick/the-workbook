title: What do you notice?

---


1. What do you notice?
    - What are its formal elements? 
    - How do they work together? How to they prioritize thenselves? Are they ever inconflict?
        - Voice (both Vo and character)
        - Music (how is it different beginning and end)
        - Image (both actively being discussed and not)
            - Why is not every image audibly discussed? What work do these other clips do?

2. How might we think of these rhetorically?
    -  How are they making their argument?
