# 20240208 english189vg station brainstorming
## messy notes
things to think about
* how many experiences should students have
    * how many sations are mandatory and how are many are optional
* staffing

to dos
* finding basic resources on overviews of the game development process, and the game industry
    * these are great to have available for folks to check out, this will help us design the thing

chris - 3d stuff

think about integrating processed media - on the green screen they get to be inside a video game? connect to AI/stable diffusion? 

unity or unreal thing with making yourself as a video game character

having a couple of cool moonshot ideas connected to JS course or other course

we can also find some readings to associate with the stations
* venues from the schell book as connected to game controllers (moving forward or leanig back, etc.)


### mk slacks
* the vision is a series of stations where they encounter all of the elements of the game design process/system as outlined, for instance, in Unity's documentation on video game design
* so, for instance  
    -   a station on modeling
    -   a station on texturing
    -   a station on inspector-based manipulation of a Unity scene
    -   a station on code-base manipulation of a Unity scene
    -   at least one station devoted to AI (maybe for the 3d end or maybe for realistic NPC dialogue generation say)
    -   arts and crafts stations on story structure/trees/forking-systems
    -   a station devoted to input devices
- all the assets
    - sound effects
    - music
    - 3d models of characters
    - rigging for characters
    - animations for characters
    - other 3d assets
    - textures and materials
    - forking/tree/looping/conditional story structures
    - database backends for stories
    - database backends for tracking user moves
    - coding (in Unity, or for web)
    - 2d assets
    - paper prototyping
    - ai
        - for texturing
        - for npc character generation
        - for character-look generation
        - for story generation
    - input devices
        - grab all the game controllers we find and have them out there
            - phone
            - ipad
            - computer
            - occulus
            -
