# email drafts

Hi all,

Thanks so much for coming to the Learning Lab this week for the GENED 1078 Creative Projects Workshop! We were so happy to have you. 

We wanted to send along [this resource](https://hackmd.io/3ugmF3oJQdyoXtplISDMCQ?view) we created for you all (you might have already received a copy of this from Bes).


If you'd like more support from us on your projects, we'd love to help. Here are some options for next steps:
- if you would like to set up a one-on-one consultation with one of our team to talk through the project, you can write back with some times that work for you to this email address
- if you think your project would benefit from time in one of our recording studios, you can likewise write back to set up a time for that (at least a week before the project's due date, as it will take us 24 hours to get you back your footage)
- if, once you have pinned down the form your project will take, you'd like some more info on how to achieve your goals, you can send us some references that match what you'd like to achieve, and we can write back with information on how to create media of the sort that you have found in these models.

All best,
Dani
