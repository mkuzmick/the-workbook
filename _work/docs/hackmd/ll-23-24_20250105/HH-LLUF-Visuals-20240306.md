# HH-LLUF-Visuals-20240306

## the basic workflow

1. generate using dall-e or midjourney
    * dall-e can be generated using [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oWihPK1bVbijGKL0RL42Qztoh1BuH1x3) and will automatically be uploaded to airtable
        * find the template in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TsNLq4SyzjvmY2DwjyyW2aZj6XKQhARP)
        * duplicate the template and add your name to it, and then use that colab.
    * midjourney images should manually be added to [this Images table in airtable](https://airtable.com/appszoCOuMekB7MzP/tbladJGoTrAqqeCwc/viwiRBePaQMpM6BPV?blocks=hide)
3. edit in Ps
4. add edited image to [this EditedImages table in airtable](https://airtable.com/appszoCOuMekB7MzP/tblF2Hoa2UPDKi2Zs/viw5ycPBzfaDv9Eyu?blocks=hide) (and link it to the record of the AI image you edited!)

## the visual assets we need:

**we are really looking for more typical, commercial stock photo looking things. getting things to look as plain as possible (as opposed to the classic AI, cutesy aesthetic) - so try to prompt styles that get at THIS**

### PFAS products (2 Parts!)

#### Part 1: 3 PFAS PRODUCTS
**prompt**: the raincoat, takeout container, and non-stick pan should be in a similar visual language (right now they don't seem like they are parts in a collection, but more just what we could find quickly)
**context**: 0:27-0:40 in Heidi's run through.

#### Part 2: MORE PFAS PRODUCTS!
**prompt**: for the part where we return we just want a ton more of these products that have PFAS. If you  google "products that have PFAS" you'll find lots of examples...but again, we just want our assets to be of similar visual language so let's make a bunch ourselves so we can have better control over the aesthetics!!
**context**: 2:12-2:28 in Heidi's run through.

#### LLUFs working on this:
- add your name here ;)

### Prison with Metal Table
**prompt**: we want to replace the current photo with a similar one.
**context**: 0:00-0:06 in Bethany's run through

#### LLUFs working on this:

### Hospital Bed
**prompt**: we want to replace the current photo with a similar one.
**context**: 0:25-0:29 in Bethany's run through
