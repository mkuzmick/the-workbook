For COMPLIT200, we are moving beyond "singles" and into "machines." The first and main machine we will make is below, matching the style of [these "fairytales"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vCqCoXAuXA0e5QBoMAbgaSXY8Y7fhT2p) from the course readings.

## Little [Color] Riding Hood Generator

* there are three minimum specs your generator must meet:
    * it must produce, in some fashion:
        1. **input=color (pantone)**
            * marlon prefers pantone colors 
                * this could be as simple as inputing a color (yellow) or move to more complex processes (transforming yellow to a random pantone shade in that larger color category; taking an image an matching the most common pixel to a panton color; etc)
        2. **title=little [color] riding hood**
            * the title MUST adhere to this formula
                * this class (and folklore) is all about formulas
        3. **fairytale content**
            * using your defined **color** and corresponding **title**, you must generate: 
                * a story that reflects the [munari texts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vCqCoXAuXA0e5QBoMAbgaSXY8Y7fhT2p)
                    * for your first proof of concept, this can be as little as five paragraphs
                        * eventually, we would want the length/format to copy the munari 
                * paired with images that reflect the [munari artwork](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vCqCoXAuXA0e5QBoMAbgaSXY8Y7fhT2p)
                    * eventually, we may expand the style, but practice prompting for this style
                * these two items will rely heavily on prompt-engineering, while you can pull much of the architecture from previously-made singles.

* if we have time/energy, we may expand beyond this basic structure and add:
    * more functionality
        * for example, formatting the text and images, then auto-exporting it into a pdf
        * auto printing this pdf 
    * mutlimodal conversions 
        * turning the text into audio, narrated by assistants or even Munari himself 
        * creating animations
        * integrating the studio 
            * live paper prototyping/coloring into the generator
    * presentation
        * once we print, we may arranging all little [color] riding hood into a color spectrum 
        * or find innovative ways to print/present the creations 
    * other ideas
        * this is where you are invited to deeply engage with the course materials/AIs/studio and invent/ptich new functions!


These generators will be presented to the course head, Jeffrey Schnapp, and may form the backbone of future workshops with the course. GAICAs working on this will not only build the generators, but will also be expected to be able to teach students how to work with their "machines" and build their own. You should feel comfortable iterating and building many different versions of these generators. However, start with a structure that meets the "three minimum specs" above.

## Action Items: 

* Josefina (jb) will build a generator using OpenAI APIs
    * the deadline for a first MVP (minimal viable product) is Monday, March 4th
    * post all your colabs in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cjrd1itBKE8GbZiTBSGPlAPb5FVQe-J5).
* Gonzalo (gp) will build a generator using Gemini APIs
    * the deadline for a first MVP (minimal viable product) is Monday, March 4th
    * post all your colabs in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vlmkhgas-9iJ7QZpxRxQF2aLtWnkter8)
