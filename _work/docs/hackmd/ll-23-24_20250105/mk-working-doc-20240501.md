# mk-working-doc-20240501


## quick ai presentation


### structure

- showing off some of the work we saw students doing with Generative AI this year
    - students enrolled in courses where faculty are experimenting with GAI
    - also the student fellows who work at the Bok Center to support these courses
    - so apologies for the alphabet soup of abbreviations and acronyms
        - MDF
        - LLUF
        - GAICA
- chatbots
    - hunt lambert bot
    - poet and critic bot
    - tdm character bots
    - emergent fun
- multimodal things
    - stable diffusion with controlnet for video games
    - for intro activity
    - for ballet
    - for live storytelling and augmentation
    - from the table to X
- reflecting on culture, ethics, identity
    - revised_prompts
    - recursive image generation


### get

photos of opposites


### examples:

First: apologies for the alphabet soup of acronyms, but just since I'm going to use them a lot 

- mdfs with the visual essay machine
- mdf afvs Julia creating a colab where students can use the vision API to analyze their work, clusters of works, etc.
- TDM course with slackbot characters in dialogue
- cl200 with function calling
- image manipulations
    - ballet dancers
    - pose analysis
    - 
- emr analysis of the ethics of AI
    - recursive image production and description
- log-every-minute-bot and other single-purpose tools?


### classifying

so we've seen students using Generative AI in these ways:
- as a reflection of cultural assumptions to interrogate (EMR)
    - where are statistically likely patterns of language and cultural associations useful in the teaching and learning process
- as a way of  
- to create 
- through learning the GAI tools, prototyping ways of creating with them
    - and, relatedly, learning THROUGH creating with them



### maybe?
- node callbacks vs dialogues
- rather than replacing ideas, documenting, organizing, augmenting
- 

### help from DD

- just cite course and prof name
- list faculty names (full names)
- 

## image dev

duotone (to match block prints)
