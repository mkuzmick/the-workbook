### Notes from the Instructor
Hi Dani,

Apologies for the slow reply! My students are very excited to return to the Learning Lab! I can send a few bullet points since it’s a bit of a repeat of last year. What we’ve done in the past that’s worked well 

1.  Brief (10-15min) presentation/ breakdown of different audio-visual, informative ‘media’ types (podcast, instagram reel, TikTok). I can send some examples along if that’s helpful!    
2.  Split students into groups to work at different “stations” to try out different formats. In the past I believe there’s been a Canva station, a podcast station, a video station, etc. We’ve usually had students start to brainstorm their final products and create a short thing to show for it (a design for the thumbnail, a quick post…). I’m hoping to have groups pre-set so they can work with their final partners.           
3.  If time, report back at end. 

I’m attaching the capstone assignment sheet here, too, if it’s helpful! But basically, a mini-intro to a bunch of options has worked well and produced great work! If there’s still a need to meet, let me know, otherwise, we should be all set!   
  

Thanks, as always, for your help & see you soon!

Hi AJ, 

This is perfect, thanks so much! If there’s any examples you’d definitely like us to show, let us know, but otherwise we have examples that we gathered last year! 

One last question – will it be 5 groups of 3 per section? 

All best, 

Dani

Hi Dani,  
  
 
For this project I usually do groups of 4 and one group of 3. So: each class will likely have 3 groups of 4 and 1 group of 3.  
  
If I have a chance to look at some examples, I’ll pass them on. Otherwise, we can use the old ones!
