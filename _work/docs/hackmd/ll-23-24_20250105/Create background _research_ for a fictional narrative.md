            prompt used: "Ask the AI to visualize and generate a short story based on a scenario, such as writing a letter."
            
## description
GAI: Students can use an AI tool to create background "research" for a fictional narrative, such as a short story or a novel. The AI tool can be prompted to generate a variety of fictional documents that add depth and realism to the narrative.

For example, if the protagonist of the story discovers a cache of letters from a long-lost relative, the AI can be prompted to "write a letter from a husband to a wife in 1952 explaining why the husband has left town." The AI can generate a realistic and emotionally resonant letter, using language and references appropriate for the time period.

Similarly, if the story involves an imaginary music festival, the AI can be prompted to "write a newspaper account of a music festival featuring [performers] held in [location] on [date]." The AI can create a vivid and detailed account of the festival, describing the performances, the audience reactions, and the overall atmosphere.

These AI-generated documents can serve as valuable tools for character development, world-building, and plot advancement. They can provide the students with a tangible connection to their fictional world, sparking their imagination and inspiring their writing.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for creative writing, it should not replace the students' own creativity and imagination. The AI-generated documents should be used as a starting point, to be further developed and refined by the students. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other creative writing techniques and strategies.

1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
