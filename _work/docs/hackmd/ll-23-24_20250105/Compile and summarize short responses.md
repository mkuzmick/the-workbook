            prompt used: "Summarize a series of short student responses to a quiz into a concise, coherent analysis. "


## description
AI tools can be used to gain insight on student questions, comments, opinions, etc., effectively serving as a polling tool. For instance, in a large lecture course where students are populating a shared Google doc with questions throughout a lecture, a tool like chatGPT can be asked to survey those student questions and tell the instructor which questions are the most common. 

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4 32K, since you'll input a significant amount of text (and GPT 3, 3.5, and 4 have word limits in the Harvard AI Sandbox).

3. First, type your questions and/or your prompt for the AI. Remember: 
    * If you only hit Enter or Return, this will automatically submit your prompt. 
    * You can also add three ticks (''') to indicate a paragraph break if you prefer.

4. For this activity, ask chatGPT to 
    * tell you the top five most common questions students are submitting
    * tell you what possible topics your upcoming lecture might address given which questions are the most frequent

## TRANSCRIPT OF ACTIVITY EXAMPLE: 
* USER: 
    * I have 200 student questions I need you to analyze. Could you please:
        * tell me the top five most common questions students are submitting
        * tell me what possible topics your upcoming lecture might address given which questions are the most frequent
        * any other trends of interest
    * [polling data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSBeSNBJDrePjLLuNI-Oag0r6Yts7FcPmhPv1y_3Bz8/edit)
        
* AI: 
    * After analyzing the student questions, here are the top five most common questions:
        * Can you explain the concept of multicellularity in simpler terms?
        * What are the main factors that triggered algae to evolve from unicellular to multicellular organisms?
        * Can you elaborate on the significance of algae in the context of evolution?
        * How does multicellularity contribute to the biodiversity we see today?
        * What are some practical applications of studying the evolution of multicellularity in algae?


    * Given these questions, your upcoming lecture might address the following topics:
        * The concept of multicellularity: This includes a simple explanation of multicellularity, the differences between multicellular and unicellular organisms, and the significance of multicellularity in biodiversity.
        * The evolution of multicellularity in algae: You could discuss the factors that triggered this evolution, how algae's multicellularity compares to that of other organisms, and the stages in this evolution.
        * The implications of multicellularity: This could cover the challenges and advantages of multicellularity, how it affects an organism's lifespan and behavior, and its role in natural selection and evolution.
        * The practical applications and significance of studying multicellularity: This might involve discussing how the study of multicellularity in algae contributes to various fields like evolutionary biology, cellular biology, and biochemistry, and its practical applications.

    * Other trends of interest include a focus on the role of multicellularity in the survival and proliferation of species, the impact of the environment on the evolution of multicellularity, and the relationship between multicellularity and the complexity of an organism's structure and functions. There's also a recurring interest in the study of algae as a key to understanding multicellularity and evolution.
