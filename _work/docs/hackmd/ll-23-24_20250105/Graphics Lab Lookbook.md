## conceptual illustrations
**Waddington's landscape (Waddington, *The Strategy of Genes*, 1957)**
A classic example from biological sciences of a visual representation of a complex concept.  It was designed to explain the connection between developmental and evolutionary dynamics. The ball represents the current state of a developing biological system. The ball rolls downhill along valleys that determine the systemâ€™s possible trajectories. The branching points in these valleys represent each developmental decision (e.g., becoming a skin cell or a blood cell). The steepness of the slopes of the valleys that are keeping the ball on track represent the robust nature of development. Underneath the surface of the landscape, pegs are connected to it by a network of ropes, which pull and alter the topography above. The pegs represent genes and the ropes their influence on the developmental system.

**Hourglass model for vertebrate development (Duboule 1994, *Development Supplement*)**
This visualization was designed to help explain the observation that when studying the development of different vertebrate species, their embryos are most similar during mid-embryogenesis (called the "phylotypic stage". This model suggests that the highest level of developmental constraints occur during mid-embryogenesis, while the lowered constraints earlier and later in development allow for more variation across species.
