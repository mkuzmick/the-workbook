# aiLab and contentLab check in 20230818

## messy notes
* we have these 5 main labs, but then we have kind of secret-ish labs that are more internally focused, about working in the LL and are more experimental. MW and kevin are connected to these.
    * welcomeLab
    * contentLab
    * aiLab
### re: ai
* one puzzle, how is aiLab it's own thing when it's involved in ALL labs. how is ai doing it extra
* we will be able to come up with some testing ideas for llufs
* contentLab is DEFINITELY going to be using ai
* in the back of our mind should be- *what does it mean to be an expert in this domain*
    * expertise like Sabrina's
    * prompt engineering
* marlon loves the idea of using other APIs and doing some really high end challenging and technical things
    * finetuning a model with marlon's slacks (that could be level of coding we could do)
### more in general
* contentLab is where we generate content. coolest/most interesting stuff can go over social channels, but the lab is about pulling everything together for anyone who has to tell any story about what we do
## next steps
* we'll meet independently about contentLab and welcomeLab
* mw and kevin trying to tackle [a doc that's about the diff modes or levels of AI or machine learning](https://hackmd.io/1IB6CdbZTDW5IQOktb8rRA?edit)
    * if it exists, let's just link to it
    * then we can think for the LL, where sit in the hierarchy of expertise
