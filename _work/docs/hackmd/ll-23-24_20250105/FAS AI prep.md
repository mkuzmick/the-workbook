## cd notes
We offered trainings to faculty across the divisions. 

The fact that departments gave us this hour of their time to help faculty get this experience of working with the sandbox was extremely valuable. Many faculty had not had the time yet to experiment with the Sandbox, and these trainings aimed to give everyone a baseline - and it set aside the time for this baseline to get established. 

And we actually had made asynchronous resources that could have just been distributed to faculty, but we actually found that getting everyone together in person allowed us to have nuanced conversations, announce uncertainties and questions, try new things, push what we know about AI—and what we know about teaching and learning—further.


Overview of the training itself
* prompt engineering
* use cases
* tons of time for discussion/reaction/questions/concerns
* pointing faculty to other resources at the university 

faculty insights:
* AI as a thought partner while drafting
    * getting ideas about next steps to take in research
    * possible topics to explore (broad)
* AI as brainstorming during translation
* AI as helping with feedback on graduate student abstracts
* AI as sorting student questions into categories live (NOT as as way to replace crucial instructor feedback but to give on-the-spot feedback that would be impossible otherwise)
* AI as helping make non-human readable datasets legible to students at earlier stages in the field
