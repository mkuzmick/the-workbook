# cd j-term gallery proof of concept
* project goal: 
    * a gallery proof-of-concept, using mdf projects, as a prototype for any form of curation + display of work (student work, fellows work, LL work, etc.)
    * being able to do this quickly and polished enough that it's a legit service we can offer
    * understanding the structure of the code enough to be able to teach it if that's something we want to do
* who would do this
    * mdfs as a service they offer to courses they work with
    * LL staff as service we provide to courses
    * LL staff as a way to curate projects for reporting to clients, University
    * xtine as way to do reporting about mdf program
    * dd, mw interact with gallery as as a way to print
* what aspects would they do
    * mdfs could be given a template at the start of the year and learn how to tweak css
        * same for LL staff? everyone know basics of css modules + and maybe actually building the app more from ground up?
    * mdfs do rigorous documentation geared toward final gallery like this
        * and ongoing documentation itself gets displayed in gallery for mdf meetings (xtine does this with help of some mdfs?)
        * both for their projects
        * and of student work in the courses they support
    * connect it to codeLab for those who are excited to actually build it from scratch (or explore low-code options like Wix, etc.)
* how relevant to mdfs
    * addresses crucial part of students' work with multimodal forms - curates those projects into something special, something that tells the story of the work that happened
    * documentation they do as mdfs what enables the gallery of mdf projects to exist
    * similarly, they'd need students to undertake documentation in way that lends itself to media-rich, narratively-/thematically rich gallery
* sessions to do with mdfs that support this
    * documenting student work using different media
    * databasing to learn
    * interviewing (students about their work)?
    * finding the story in the project?
    * basic css?
