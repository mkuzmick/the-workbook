# Photographing in a Museum

There are tons of challenges around photographing in a museum, from whether or not its even allowed to figuring out how to accurately represent the art as it was intended, there are loads of considerations to keep in mind.

## Avoiding Keystoning

To start, if you're able to shoot in your museum of choice, knowing whether or not it is behind glass will make a significant determination. 

If it is NOT behind glass, you have quite a bit of freedom to accurately capture your object. Cameras have a number of ways they distort objects. First, how wide your lens is will effect how the image distorts at the edges. Wide lenses, especially on your phone are great at capturing *more*, but they tend to stretch and distort at the sides. Your "normal" lens will reduce the majority of this distortion. 

Next, as cameras are capturing 3D objects and turning them into a 2D form(yes, even 2D art forms are 3D!), being aware of how your camera interprets the world around you will go a long way to prevent distortions like **keystoning**
* Start by holding your phone perfectly parallel to your object. If it's hanging on a wall, your phone should be straight up and down, on a table, it should be perfectly flat. 
* Next, align your phone to the center of your subject, so that it's exactly the same distance left to right as well as top to bottom. 
* Start taking photos!

## Avoiding Glare

Next, if your subject is behind glass, this will introduce some possible considerations. Try following the above instructions to start, if you find that there is a glare showing up from the lights on the subject, then you'll have to start getting creative.

**Angle of reflection is also angle of incidence** This means that best place for your camera is also going to likely be the best place for your glare to show up. You can adjust this by shifting the axis your camera is on. 

Try first to pull back from the object, increasing your distance and zooming in. If this fails to fix your problem(this may work better with smaller objects than larger). Then you will have to think about shifting your angle and giving in to keystoning. Or you could photograph it with the glare, and add additional detail photographs to help fill in the missing details.
