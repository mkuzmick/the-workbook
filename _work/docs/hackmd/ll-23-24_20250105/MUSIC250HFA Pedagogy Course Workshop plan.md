### messy notes 20231020
* we can have the whole time, so there should be an activity part of it
    * certainly a micro presentation, like an informal intro or something
* mk said we often do a tour of tools, clip of adam neely, 12 tone. 
* think about how to build the students' skills up to that, for scaffolding, potentially brainstorming about building the pieces of basic competencies etc.
    * 20 photos of the same object or a visual pattern
* 2 of the students are teaching intro to music theory and 2 aren't teaching at all
* CB can do the unpacking of a visual essay + normal podcast since those are 2 most common formats

#### flow-
first hour
* MK does a SUPER quick tour of the tools
* Intro - get in pairs, brainstorm about what's interesting in this zone
* then they share their intro over the overhead giving us a few key things
* then deep dive into a few things - CB breaks down a video essay (phone booth or avengers one) and podcast (serial)
second hour- how are students actually going to do this
* how do we get students to do the thing conversation -
    * how would you build the things we've identified
    * how to grade/respond to the things
    * some tools they can use, including AI tools in Music
* activity - find some model they think is cool, and pitch an idea and how you would scaffold that, including tools you might use, and potentially some things you'd think about while grading

LL to dos
* AI tools
    * we'll ask madeleine if she's found some
    * put together a small list of things that are relevant
* print tips on grading podcasts handout
* loading up serial and the video essays
