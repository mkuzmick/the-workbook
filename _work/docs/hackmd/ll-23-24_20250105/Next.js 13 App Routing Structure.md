# Next.js 13 App Routing Structure

Next.js 13 introduces a revamped app routing structure that provides a more intuitive way to organize your project directory and define routes for your application. This guide will walk you through the key concepts of the new routing structure and how to set it up effectively.

## Project Directory Structure

When setting up your project directory in Next.js 13, you'll follow a specific structure to define your app's routes and components. Let's break down the main components of this structure:

### `/src/app` Folder

The `/src/app` folder serves as the **homepage** of your app. The `page.tsx` file within this folder exports the React component that will be displayed on the homepage of your app. This corresponds to the root URL of your app, e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/`.

### Subfolders in `/src/app`

Any folder you create within the `/src/app` folder will become a unique **path** that you can access in your app. For instance:

- Creating a folder `/src/app/quiz1` will create a path `https://yourdomain.com/quiz1`.
- Placing a `page.tsx` file inside this folder will define the React component displayed at that path.

### Pages and API Routes

Inside each subfolder of `/src/app`, you can place various files that define the behavior of your app's routes:

- `page.tsx`: This file defines a **page component** that will be rendered at the corresponding path. For example, a `page.tsx` file in `/src/app/quiz1` will be the content displayed at `https://yourdomain.com/quiz1`.

- `route.tsx` or `route.js`: These files define **API routes**. An API route handles server-side logic and can be accessed at the corresponding path. For instance, a `route.tsx` file in `/src/app/quizsubmission` can handle interactions like form submissions and data processing.

### Organizing Components and Utilities

While the `/src/app` folder contains your main page components and API routes, you can further organize your project as follows:

- **Components**: Create a separate folder, e.g., `/src/components`, to store modular components like `Button`, `Card`, etc. These components can be used across different pages within your app.

- **Utilities**: For utility functions or modules, such as data fetching, create a folder like `/src/utilities`. Here, you can place files like `getAirtableData.js` that handle specific tasks without cluttering your page components.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Folder-Based Routing**: In Next.js 13, folders serve as the primary means of defining routes. The URL structure is based on the hierarchy of folders within the `/src/app` folder.

2. **`page.tsx` and `route.tsx`**: Use `page.tsx` files to define the content displayed at a particular route, and `route.tsx` files for handling server-side logic and API routes.

3. **Component and Utility Organization**: Keep modular components in the `/src/components` folder and utility functions in the `/src/utilities` folder to maintain a clean project structure.

Remember, the revamped routing structure provides more flexibility and clarity for managing your Next.js 13 app. Mapping out your app's structure on paper can help you visualize the routes and logic before implementing them.
