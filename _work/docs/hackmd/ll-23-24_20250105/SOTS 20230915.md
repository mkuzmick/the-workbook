# SOTS 20230915

## tasks
* we need to be able to delegate small tasks to people
    * think about 10 sample tasks 
        * make sure we know what projects they'd be linked to
        * know how to handle available for and assigned to
    * challenge - don't know that many tasks should be assigned to many many people, because then no one is really responsible for it
* we might want views that show us only things with deadline, or without working docs
* first we work on getting the database to have these things and that we can show them to people
    * eventually we could print out tasks and they can be placed in a "done" jar and then DD and MW can update in airtable
    * mk says eventually we really want this happening in slack though
## projects
* also project review and make sure fields are what we want
    * title
    * slug field
    * decide what we want the Id to be
* consulting relationship is ongoing so not done
* student consultations and office hours are also ongoing
    * dd can add "in progress" so we can sometimes filter out "ongoing"

## get markdown buttons 
* get markdown for single action checklist
    * what are some groupings of actions might we want
        * by person
        * by project
        * by role (assigned to - this means responsible for getting it done)
        * by role (available for)
        * by skills
        * (absolutely anyone will be handled by dani and madeleine) - should also print these
* dani will keep assigned to, responsible for, and available for.
    * the priority would be "Responsible For", "Assigned To" can happen if we want
    * mk said there could be a script where responsible for and assigned to get filled out the same. and then responsible for person could then change the "assign to" later

## addition systems things
* additional things from the media team (MK)
    * need file names
    * and need to track them as files
* we want to see what it looks like when we print out at project report
    * project report run from data that is in airtable
    * ideally we can click 20 projects and get summaries of those
        * we'd want this in show your work, but we do want to have the ability in projects base to print out a recipe card
    * mk said while we're working on things we want to be able to print out works in progress etc.
    * out of the project base, we want everything we're going to do for every project. like a recipe card
    * for everything we're doing - that will be in show your work
