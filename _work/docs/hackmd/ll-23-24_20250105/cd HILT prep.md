## key quotes
* from crimson: 
    * "While generative AI offers students the chance to increase their productivity and creativity, when used less conscientiously, it provides students an avenue to circumvent the skill-building nature of their assignments."
* from crimson on fas guidelines:
    * "The FAS guidance instructs faculty not to enter student work into AI systems, and Stubbs noted that third-party AI platforms own both users’ prompts and computer-generated responses."
    * "The AI policies that were present in course syllabi varied widely, with some courses entirely restricting tools like ChatGPT and others permitting their — appropriately acknowledged — use entirely. Many courses detail unacceptable uses of AI, such as answering homework questions, explaining concepts, or writing code, while others wholly forbid AI use except for specific course assignments."

## opening remarks
* thank you so much for joining us to hear from harvard college and harvard graduate students about generative AI and how its shaping their academic and professional lives
    * this is one of the most significant intellectual, ethical, and social topics of our moment
    * and we're very grateful to HILT for providing a forum for this discussion
    * and to all of the offices across the university who inaugurated the process of centering students in these discussions
    * we're excited to hear from our panelists, who have generously given their time and insights to our benefit!
* christine intro
* liz intro
* christine: what is generative AI?
    * generative AI tools create responses (textual, visual, mathematical, code, etc.) to user prompts
    * they survey existing data to generate these responses, predicting the probablity that, say, one term or phrase will appear/exist in relation to another (this is how LLMs like chatGPT produce content)
    * many different digital tools are beginning to integrate AI capacities, including the Adobe suite which students at Harvard College have access to (Photoshop is rolling out a generative fill feature, for instance)
    * as many of us already know, generative A.I. can be incredibly powerful, but it can also "hallucinate" and reproduce biases (including those contained in the datasets it trains on)
* we'll begin our roundtable by asking our panelists to variously reflect on their experiences with generative AI
* then we'll open it up to Q&A to our audience
    * all questions are welcomed and encouraged! we all have varying experiences with generative AI
* we'd like to ask our speakers to please introduce themselves the first time they speak
    * please share your name
    * your pronouns, if you would like to
    * your concentration or graduate program
