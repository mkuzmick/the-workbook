![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F06HBE43MQC/img_7592.jpg?pub_secret=eeabecef31)

## camera movement
* pan
    * panning across or up and down the artwork
* tilt

## composition
* depth of field - shallow versus large
* cu, mcu, wide 
    * when to capture process at these distances
* 

## lighting
* hard vs soft 
* diffusing the light
* two lights at 45 degree angles to artwork
    * how to reduce glare
* lights halfway between camera and artwork if capturing in mcu range
* exposure
    * blown out to complete white = overexposed (depending on desired effect)

## moves
* turning pages
    * hands visible
    * from an angle 
* close up of artist holding artwork, gesturing as they describe and analyze it
    * over the shoulder shots
* montage of many artworks
* panning up and down and across the object
* if artist documents their own work, an image of them doing that
    * an image of them showing the images they've taken of their artwork?! :) 
* wide shot of multiple objects
    * then cut to detail of single object in that array
    * panning across object in CU detail view
* shots of workspace, notes, thinking, the materials of the studio
* sketch to object
* CU or MCU of artist's face while working
    * cut to hand/object of artist's gaze (eg., if they're working on a sketch, cut to the sketch)

## the visual story, bruce block
* contrast and affinity
    * greater the contrast = visual intensity increases
    * greater the affinity = visual intensity decreases
* perspective
    * one-point: top and bottom of plane meet in vanishing point
    * two-point: two vanishing points
    * the eye is drawn to vanishing points

## questions
* installation view something we'd want students to consider how to capture?
* when does documentation become something that students would do themselves
    * ie., that would venture into their artistic practice
* will they be interviewed at any point? do we talk about talking to camera?
