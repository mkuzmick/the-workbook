# mk-system-planning-20231105

## today

- audio out of hyperdecks into focusrite then logic for transcription and audio isolation?
- 
- connect both multiviews
- run both to decklink in mac pro
- keep me1 going to decklink for audio
- map to amxs: ME1-4, top 4 cams
- run amxs me1 to decklink for additional angle + additional audio
- so decklink gets
    - ME1 from a8k
    - ME1 from amxs
    - ME1-4 (or 1-2, or 2-3; plus 2 extra cams)
    - top 4 cams
- run alt into a studio
- think about running back to hub or in to a4k or a8k direct
- add dynamic mics to control room (maybe record on the studio) for commentary
- actually have special a8k outputs for amxs---that's the spot to do it because we aren't using them all (for 4 slots)---4 slots need audio
- machines
    - mac air 15
    - studio for small studio
    - more studio displays
    - if iMac update then iMacs
- other gear
    - music equipment
    - hyperdecks
    - 
- make bot with Conrad
-

    - make sure all audio is here

    - Mac Studio x2 one for each
- audio hits Mac Pro through interface
- studios just get a stereo mix appropriate to what they're doing
