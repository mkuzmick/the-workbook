# ENGLISH189VG-Faculty Consultation-writing

## Writing Task Description and Notes

### Context
V asked for feedback on syllabus [found in project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/170uFPy61js8vXq_G3MqiMTdalCtOzk60)
> Dear all,
> 
> I'm off tomorrow to London for a long weekend, to deliver a lecture, so I thought I'd write this up quickly -- the syllabus doc, with changes. If I've missed anything, please do say. One thing would be to check that (I've now fixed the dates) the Lab can really offer workshops on the mentioned days, and all the other stuff I've said you can do too (it sounds like a lot of work)!
> 
> 
> Michael, I don't envision a big planning meeting before our first class, so do book your January travel and, as long as it doesn't actually clash with class, we can work around it?
>   
> 
> all best, Vid

so MK will review syllabus and draft text for DD to send back in the email.

### Deliverables
draft of text for email

## Text Drafting
re: office hours support "We have open office hours towards the end of the term during final project crunch time. Throughout the whole term, weâ€™re available for consultations by appointment, tutorials, and resources."
