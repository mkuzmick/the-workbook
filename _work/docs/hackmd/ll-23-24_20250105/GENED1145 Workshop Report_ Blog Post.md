## An Active Dive into Layering and Compositing: The Learning Lab's GENED 1145 Workshop

GENED 1145 Global Japanese Cinema, under the expert guidance of Professor Alexander Zahlten, became an even richer learning experience with the Learning Lab's specialized workshop. We took students on a journey through layering, compositing, and the art of the video essay.

At our **Visual Arguments** station, we equipped students to craft compelling visual arguments using an array of film stills and art supplies. This immersive activity prepared them to understand and analyze films and laid the groundwork for their future forays into digital toolkits.

Moving to the **Overlays in Cinema** station, we led students in dissecting the art and science of cinema layering. From exploring VFX intricacies to hands-on experiments recreating scenes from iconic films, we transformed theory into tangible understanding.

And at the **Digital Tools Overview** station, we introduced students to pivotal software platforms. From Canva's simplicity to the depths of After Effects, we showcased techniques like matting and keying, empowering students to creatively reimagine film excerpts.

Reflecting on this workshop, it’s evident that the blend of hands-on activities and insightful discussions we facilitated enriched students’ understanding. With these newfound skills, we're eager to see how they shape their explorations in Global Japanese Cinema.
