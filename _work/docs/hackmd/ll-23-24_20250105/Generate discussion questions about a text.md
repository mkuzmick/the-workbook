            prompt used: "a diagram of discussion questions for a university course."
            
## description

Students can use AI tools like chatGPT to generate discussion questions about a text. By uploading the text to GPT or a similar text generation tool, students prompt the AI to give them questions about the text that they could answer as they read and analyze it. Students could also potentially bring these questions with them to discussion sections or use them to prepare for upcoming lectures. They could also prompt the AI to help them consider alternative/competing arguments to those presented in the text or to unpack assumptions embedded in the text.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
3. For this activity, you will also use the "upload file" function
    * NOTE: with chatGPT 32K, you can also copy and paste the text directly into the chat. However, the file upload will be more efficient.

3. For this activity
    * Ask a question that captures your discussion goals and asks for any additioonal information you would find helpful. An example prompt can be found below.

## Transcript of activity example:

* USER:
    * Read the attached text. Based on this text, generate a list of insightful and thought-provoking discussion questions suitable for a university-level archaeology course. These questions should:
        1. Encourage critical analysis of the main themes and arguments presented in the text.
        2. Prompt consideration of the broader implications and relevance of these themes in the field of archaeology.
        3. Involve comparison and contrast with other archaeological findings, theories, or methods, where appropriate.
        4. Stimulate debate and discussion on ethical, methodological, or theoretical aspects related to the text.
        5. Include at least one question that requires synthesizing information from the text with external knowledge or readings.
    * Additionally, provide a brief explanation for each question on why it is relevant and how it contributes to a deeper understanding of the topic.
* AI: 
    * **Question**: How does the author challenge the conventional understanding of the "kiva" in Anasazi archaeology? Why does he argue that the concept of the "kiva" was established before the development of a systematic field of Southwestern archaeology?
        * Explanation: This question encourages students to critically analyze the author's main argument that the concept of the "kiva" was established before the development of a systematic field of Southwestern archaeology. It prompts them to consider the implications of this argument for our understanding of Anasazi archaeology and the role of historical and political factors in shaping archaeological interpretations.
    * **Question**: What are the implications of the author's argument that Pueblo I proto-kivas, Pueblo II kivas, and Pueblo III kivas were probably domestic pit structures, rather than ceremonial structures? How does this challenge traditional interpretations of Anasazi architecture and society?
        * Explanation: This question prompts students to consider the broader implications of the author's argument for our understanding of Anasazi architecture and society. It encourages them to critically evaluate traditional interpretations and consider alternative perspectives.
    * **Question**: How does the author's argument about the pit house-to-pueblo transition challenge or align with other theories or findings in the field of archaeology?
        * Explanation: This question encourages students to compare and contrast the author's argument with other theories or findings in the field of archaeology. It prompts them to consider the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and the importance of considering multiple perspectives.
    * **Question**: What are the ethical implications of the early anthropologists' use of the term "kiva" and their interpretation of Pueblo architecture in light of their political concerns for the Pueblos?
        * Explanation: This question stimulates debate and discussion on the ethical aspects of archaeological interpretation. It encourages students to consider the impact of political and social factors on the interpretation of archaeological evidence.
    * **Question**: How does the author's argument about the idea of the "kiva" relate to broader debates in archaeology about the interpretation of archaeological evidence and the influence of contemporary social and political contexts on these interpretations?
        * Explanation: This question requires students to synthesize information from the text with external knowledge or readings. It encourages them to consider the broader theoretical and methodological debates in archaeology and the relevance of these debates for understanding the interpretation of archaeological evidence.
