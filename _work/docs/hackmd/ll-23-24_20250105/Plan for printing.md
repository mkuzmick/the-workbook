# ENGLISH184CF Schedule
| Time | Action |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| 5 min     |  Place students into pairs; each pair picks out one of the following themes listed on the syllabus: gender, age, religion, desire, species, mode of transport, time of day (these will be on large cards)    | 
| 5 min     | Leaders will announce that students will be asked to make two maps of Cambridge, MA related to that theme. Before they begin mapping, students will be asked to quickly brainstorm many different ways of showing distinction/comparison/etc around the theme and write all of the possibilities they can come up with on small notecards. | 
| 10 min     |  Students will reflect on how doable each of these options are (e.g., is the data available?), how profound the insight is, whether the elements "speak to each other," and get feedback from Lara and Learning Lab staff, who will be floating around the room. Through this process, pairs will narrow down to one feasbile and meaningful concept for their two maps. | 
| 5 min     | Pairs are randomly assigned a station to make a quick prototype of the base map: 2 x stations where they use a projector; 2 x stations with pre-printed maps from Google Maps; 2 x stations with arts supplies ONLY; 2 x stations with computers/digital maps
| 20 min     | Students have time to make a prototype of their map interventions. They are asked to come up with a key and other visual strategies in order to translate their data and argument into effective visual rhetoric (for example--arts supplies; students can ask us to print out icons; legos and other 3D markers)
15 min     | Each pair is asked to state their theme and explain how their two maps relate to each other in 30 seconds. They present this one other pair; the group of four votes one of the two sets of maps to be shared with more of the class. This continues until there are two map presentations to the entire class. Lara or Anita conclude the session feedback on the core idea of the assignment--how do the two maps speak to each other and form an argument in dialogue?|
