## [meeting 3/1](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CJIMHN1nunkMhykhz6SK0dWAMqub_aB-) 


GAICA: **Gabe**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-wZeU4fMoZGhZwFh9Spw2ag_xp6rA0IX/view?usp=drive_link): The question that this music class is sort of asking is, "can machines understand musical form?" And I think that's a really interesting question, and I think it is a very interesting problem to solve. And when I think about it sort of in the context of the Learning Lab, I think it's a really, I mean, I think this is a great place for people to experiment with questions like that. And I certainly think that like sort of delving into the, into this AI space, the generative AI space, I think really placing an emphasis on you know, "how can we how can we build things that don't replace, but instead sort of lift up others in a way that is useful and productive and saves people time? To do the jobs that they already do?" I think that and not just for my project, but for, you know, any project.

GAICA: **Indra**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTP8ejle8NXwTb0HPB0BI3LBcMqGSjjw/view?usp=drive_link): Because I think it's something that has only recently been introduced. It's something that, likem looks like threat to education or for certain jobs. And I am a firm belief-- I'm a firm believer that I think integrating AI with certain jobs can-- what you say--  help us lift up society and help us advance faster.

And I think sort of like the work that we're doing here, you know, integrating with classes such as comparative literature, is the perfect way to show everybody that we don't really need to see it as a threat, but rather like something that elevates us to a different level that perhaps we couldn't achieve without these kind of technologies.

GAICA: **Gonzalo**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ibxUCoU1AjxR8b8KYf4sdd3w3p1MUKRk/view?usp=drive_link): For me, this this job feels like an ideal job that I didn't have on campus because personally, I love building stuff. I love coding, just, I don't know, it's my way of of getting creative, and having fun. And I always learn new things. We all do that. But when you have a lot of classes and responsibilities, it's hard to find a time to actually work on your hobbies and stuff like this in your free time. And this job gives me an opportunity to focus that time. And, you know, have that moment where I can code and be creative and learn new things. You know, also, I think that we've got we've reached a point, in history where we have a lot of technology, readily available to do anything. We have all the puzzle pieces, and now, people like us need to think about how to put them together to build something cool and something new.

GAICA: **Jﾅ行h**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nRp_AyNO37b0XmI5Yg7UGeK3tAUCPYiB/view?usp=drive_link): So my background is that I'm coming from a double concentration in CS and social studies. So I've always been super interested in how humanities and CS kind of interact. So that's kind of the vibe that I came into, like what I was interested in. And then I met Madeleine a couple weeks ago at a Intellectual Vitality night, where we were discussing the role of LLMs in humanities education. So can things like large language models or generative AI be incorporated into humanities education and be successfully used? I wish I had an answer. I wish someone had an answer. But meanwhile, while we try to get there, I think the best thing we can do is see what type of implementations from CS can be implemented in humanities courses. So I'm excited to work on COMPLIT200, because the professor is trying to lead an effort to integrate generative AI and large language models into his class, namely, the idea that folktales and fairy tales and these types of mythical stories can also be captured using generative AI and thinking like, how can we exercise and bridge the gap of human creativity and machine creativity, and kind of have them coalesce into one piece?

GAICA: **Gabe**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gl5U-Tbfgag_XnqB1jNu4OGiBcpRrzjv/view?usp=drive_link): Yeah. Just very briefly, I'm working on, a sequence to sequence transformer model that, will basically train on sequences of musical melodies and output scores based on that. And so I'm doing I'm building this sort of, like, you call it an internal tool. I think that's like more or less what it is like. It's like a tool that could, be used to sort of ask and potentially answer difficult questions about like, "can machines understand musical form?" And I'm building this for MUSIC225 taught by Alex Redding. So a little bit different of like an application, but like still definitely in like the generative AI range. And I think it's less about, you know, calling APIs. It's more like trying to work with the inputs and outputs of this sort of, well known model to see if I can sort of get it to do what I want it to do.

GAICA: **Jﾅ行h**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMtAn_oZp-KzZASDu1_J29Ajsrz3miYN/view?usp=drive_link): I originally wanted to get involved with the project because I think there needs to be think tank style spaces where people just talk about like, "what does it look like to actually put this technology in the classroom? Like, what does it do for the student?" I mean, we talked about it a lot a couple weeks ago. Like, you know, we had a big dive in on, like the rhetorical essay. It's like a type of, you know, like assessment of a human's ability to think like, well, will that still be viable in 20 to 25 years based on the technology that we come up with? And, you know, we had a lot of discussion. And I won't get into the nitty gritty, but I'm excited for this first project because I feel like it's a step in the direction of this is a humanities class. It's comparative literature. And now there's like a literal coded bot that can help you create the story and images. And, you know, I don't I don't know if that's what the end project will look like, but I think it's a step in the right direction of that same core question, which is: "education, all this tech; [together] what does it look like?""

GAICA: **Indra**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1TDal2Q05RqfhHKCf00IMoO5H3Dual4/view?usp=drive_link): I started coding, in college, so it's very exciting to have more of a, yeah, "practice" experience that also can benefit people, because I feel like sometimes in classes it's very theoretical-- which is really cool too-- but I think, coding is only complete when you can do both. And it's very rewarding to see, to be working on a project that benefits you and benefits everybody. And it's also really fun. And I think also like hearing from everyone, everybody's so excited to be working on this projects.

[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qWOrhL-hBgIExjOzGDe2CNBd8YXcJN2/view?usp=drive_link):
I think the way I see development going in, what I'm most interested in is user interaction. So if this is meant to be given to students, and the idea is that I, as a comparative literature student, will use this. My biggest concern is like, am I restricting the creativity of the individual in the code that I create?

## [meeting 2/16](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YOsOy1W0_QBkupyXUWkPJakdVOhdImTC)


GAICA: **Gabe**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H7n6TnQOgdL0o75u5_7UxdrFBQ8ynWYs/view?usp=drive_link): It's funny, I took, because I'm a music secondary. I took MUSIC1. **And my TF was Chris Bennett, who works here at the Learning Lab and is a fantastic TF, great section, great section leader.** And for our final we had, like, listening. It was like a listening quiz and we had to like, memorize like 50 like pieces. And we had to be able to identify them. And so instead of like, just like clicking on one and like trying to, like, close my computer and like, remember it, I actually wrote like a Python script to just, like, quiz myself. And I just made a YouTube playlist and I would like, pull up the, the web page for me. **And I sent it to Chris. I was like, you can send this to students if you want to use it. And so that's how he knew I was a computer science major and was interested in music as well. And so he reached out to me and just emailed me. He was like, hey, do you want to work on a music computer science tech project with Learning Lab? And I was like, that sounds awesome.**

GAICA: **Josefina**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1psoY72_c5aV9XStpGkFhUZKXl3-pjNaR/view?usp=drive_link): I'm super excited about the potential of using AI to solve medical problems. And I saw that-- or I feel like -- working as a GAICA on like, these smaller projects is a way to, I don't know, get engaged with coding and AI in a way that is outside of the classroom... Like, it's like creating your own, like baby.

GAICA: **Gonzalo**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1urPo8ZpRZjdehWTM28KEENkzlab1Airu/view?usp=drive_link): I'm making like these code blocks, using the, using Google Colab so that students can use it as if it was like scratch and integrate it to a much bigger product. And the code blocks are mainly about using the APIs. So I've been working with the OpenAI API, so I mainly go through the documentation, I read it, I extract it, I make the code work, and I make it like executable with like parameters in a form that students can just type in a prompt or anything and just click and run the code easily.

GAICA: **Gabe**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1buvrfgDSum-092KSnbpYacxd12t8b3Xt/view?usp=drive_link): I think what's really interesting is, you know, AI's been around for a long time. It's not like AI is like a new thing. In terms of, like, the history of technology. And even if we're talking about generative generative AI, it's still not necessarily like the newest thing out there, but it's just this one very, very specific type of generative AI that we're talking about that's just exploded, right?

GAICA: **Gonzalo**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyG81V76tdxP8wfXEkOQWRozNsk2tI0a/view?usp=drive_link): My name is Gonzalo. I'm a sophomore. Also studying computer science. I'm in Cabot House. I'm originally from Argentina. And I started working on stuff here, like, around last year. There was a friend of mine was working here. And I did a bunch of coding jobs like, react pages and slack bots. And I used a lot the OpenAI API. And so this semester, when I came here, they told me about this new GAICA job, and I thought it sounded very exciting, so I accepted the position.

GAICA: **Gabe**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6JXc-qezySTtI2kdena_EolQ9EaqfaF/view?usp=drive_link): So I'm working with, Music 225, taught by Alex Redding, who's in the music department here at Harvard. He's very nice guy. I've met him before. And, the course is all about musical form, so asking questions about, you know, what is musical form and what sort of different shapes and sizes and colors does that take on? And particularly classical music is the focus of that course. So what I've been asked-- and sort of have suggested-- that I do was sort of extend a project that I was working on over the past few months, which is working on a generative model to generate musical notes. So it's basically taking the idea of a transformer model which generates sequence of words like GPT or any other LLM. And instead of generating word by word, it generates note by note.

GAICA: **Josefina**
[TRANSCRIPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIrNgoMuxRjgMchnr3hLg-DtU9aB52ab/view?usp=drive_link): My name is Josephina Biernacki. I'm from Norway, a sophomore studying bioengineering, and I live in Winthrop House. And within bioengineering, I'm very interested in the applications of AI in health care medicine. And I would love to learn more about like ML, outside of class, because I have such limited amount of time for I have a lot of concentration requirements. So I feel like, being able to work on this outside of class is very attractive to me.
