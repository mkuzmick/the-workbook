constraints

nodal thing
everything thing we do can be an input and an output - there can be a lot of recursive loops
if they can get a card and have to do at least 3 steps


## siriana and chris
blender part 
stable diffusion and make images
upload images to spatial
virtual gallery that you can walk through

(chris can also talk about the other things he's done with blender)

## kevin/cd
foucault
emr recursive things
learning as a map, not a string

## emily+alexa (+other sci mdfs?) with jk!
* emily and alexa working on video montages (neuro101 presentations, chalk talk planning, )
    * mk suggested quotes from teaching and learning
    * practice and retrieval with different modes and content, helps etc.
* mk requested some biorender images from mcb197
* emily asked what the initial prompt should be 
    * "your work"?
    * emily said maybe specific is more helpful
    * mk said better to have scientific concepts that almost everyone understands (earth goes around the sun, etc.)
    * levels of challenges
        * paper translations for the scientists
        * how you'd coach them towards not clipart that's representing a pattern or conceptual relationship

## messy notes

sci comm station at main table, or we build something like the main table by the TV by control room

maybe music studio for podcasting

music studio or small studio for VR zone
get 2 llufs that siriana can teach to help with the spatial thing
maybe siriana is at the stage


we should start thinking about how to name the stations


scicomm to chris to spatial?
foucault game show at the table?


anna could do stable diffusion ballet stuff?

art supplies table - half crafting to learn, half crafting to teach?
* learning through science comm vs. learning to communicate science
