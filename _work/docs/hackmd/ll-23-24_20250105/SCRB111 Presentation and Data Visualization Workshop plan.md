### messy notes from mk-jk-dd-er check-in 20230913
* one option - tournament throwdown for main part - divide paper into sections. tournament style in groups, present to each other in groups.
* jessica really wants to keep the ice breaker, group formation thing (how an overhead camera works, how to manipulate that area, use as a stage)
    * mk - taking a static visualization and you're turning it into a story. making it temporal, building it up. that's awesome - they can do it on lower stakers things first (like with the quadrant ice breaker thing)
* they could use overhead for their final presentation. (and they could get feedback from chatgpt on how to make their presentation better)
* jk said it's all overhead camea - jessica doesn't really care about the medium/close shot of the presenter
* audience is still broad, general group
* cool for emily to pull together research from cogsci about why this is important and why it demonstrates deep knowledge 
* find a way of getting students to grasp that memorization is not the way in the intro activity maybe - know the concepts, know the storyboard, go from point to point, etc.
* in the beginning do a paper deconstruction thing.
    * mk suggests memory vs understanding thing central to the activity
    * doing that by figure in the sciences is a good way of getting started
    * emily said doing figures makes sense - mostly use the gehrke reading.
