## Next Steps
- Get ll.media.2023 up to date
- Then push all of history to Glacier Deep Archive
	- check what the cost would be to push from S3 vs Synology
- Build semi-automated process for generating proxy and pushing it up to Synology10
	- then ultimately push this up to S3 Flexible Glacier
- Clear excess from Synologys

### Considerations
- Do we want all our proxy on Synology10?
	- Current proxy folder is 3.24TB
		- Synology10 has 14TB available left 
		- Old Syn9 proxy copies are 18.16TB
	- 2019_01 through 2020_03
	- then 2021_11 through 2023
	- NOT totally up to date, even if the month folder is there
