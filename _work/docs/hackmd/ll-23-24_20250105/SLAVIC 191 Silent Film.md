To explore the medium of film through the practice of making _and_ analyzing it, students in Slavic 191: Silent Film came to the Learning Lab for an interactive workshop that deployed different elements of silent film. Students examined stills from different silent films they had watched in the course, creating their own intertitles on large black pieces of paper to describe and analyze the shot composition, framing, camera angles, and lighting of different scenes. At the same time, the speech to text Open AI API Whisper was used to take what students were saying outloud and generate digital intertitles on the spot that had the students’ insights on them. At another station, students explored camera work, blocking, and acting, thinking about the capabilities of cameras and how camera positioning and framing shape the film’s narrative or convey an actor’s subjectivity. A third station used a green screen and cameras to project ink-drawn film sets made by students in the style of German expressionist films like Dr. Caligari. Students then devised scenes to enact in front of their film set. Through this workshop, students gained significant fist-hand experience working with the form, learning about the relationship between form and content through the act of making a silent film.
