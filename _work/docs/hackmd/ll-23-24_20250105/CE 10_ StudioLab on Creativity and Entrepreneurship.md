# CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship
In CE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship, students developed pitch videos for their entrepreneurial projects. They began with a business model canvas and received feedback from Hunt Lambert, which was then used to train an OpenAI bot. This bot provided additional, nuanced feedback on their pitches, offering a unique interactive learning experience. Despite some challenges in fine-tuning the AI, this approach added significant value to the students' entrepreneurial understanding and project development.
