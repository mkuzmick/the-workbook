# SOC-STD68RA Workshop 2 plan

## key info
- Where: LL Main Studio, 50 Church St.
- When: Wednesday, Nov. 8th, 2023

## plan

The objective of this workshop is to provide some strucutred augmentation to the students' project process. There will be 3 main activities which will prompt students to reflect on thier projects, build skills and get directed support in the form they are working in, and identify key next steps in thier process.



### activites/tests
#### **TAKING STOCK**
   Students will have some time to review where we left off 
#### **HACKATHON**
   Station zones for students to learn and work, and we will have a few staff rotating through and answering questions, helping students overcome technical hurdles:


There will be 3 zones during the hackathon:
    
1. **capture zone**
Video recording will be limited in scope during the hackathon, with option to book a recording time in our small studio. 
We will give tips for audio recording as well!
  2. **digital editing zone**
This will be for students to use our computers or their own computers for video editing, graphic design, simple web development, and interactive games.
3. **physical construction zone**
This will include resources and meterials for zine construction, button making, artist books, and developing paper-based visuals.

Additionally, we can offer a pop up consultation zone on the best form and tool given their project scope, their technical skill level, and the Learning Lab resources. 
        
#### **SHARING OUT & NEXT STEPS**
  Students will present in 1 minute:
    1. the progress you made today during the hackathon
        2. next steps 
        
   We can try to get transcripts of these presentations to share back to them for reflection and feedback
