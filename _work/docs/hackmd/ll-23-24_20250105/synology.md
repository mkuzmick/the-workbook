# getting footage from workshops on synology

## what is synology?!
When the LL team refers to "synology," we're talking about the servers that hold all of the footage we get from workshops and other events we hold in our space (as well as the shoots we do elsewhere).

This footage is an absolute goldmine of awesome moments of teaching and learning using the media and technical capacities of the LL.

We need your help to find these moments in this footage, by scrubbing through it and then taking selects and stills that we can use in our reports about all of the amazing things that our fellows and staff do!

This is a guide to getting on synology - the means of getting that footage!

## getting on synology
* get on any LL desktop connected to ethernet
* open Finder
* click on Synology_10
    * usually it's connected already but if it isn't, you can log with the LL credentials (see any LL staff to get help with this part!)
* 10_01
    * in this folder, you can go into the fellows folder (and LLUF or MDF, depending on who you are)
    * make a folder for yourself
    * store in here your stills and exports
    * but NOT massive amounts of footage, because that will crash our servers
* in the _proxy folder
    * this is where all of the proxy footage from workshops can be found, organized by year and date
    * this is where you should pull your footage from since it's a more manageable size!
    * click and drag them onto your drive
* before putting things on a drive
    * it's a good idea to just open stuff you might want in QuickTime and scrub through it to figure out if it's what you actually want
    * good things: great shots of folks learning, cool stuff under the overhead, etc.
* if you're using an LL drive
    * make sure to make a new folder with your name 
    * and probably within that folder, a folder with the project name, date, etc.
