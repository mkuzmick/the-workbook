## OVERVIEW 

Welcome to the Learning Lab! The LL is many things, but the larger "machine" of the lab-- when taken as a whole-- is an AI-augmented design studio. Workshops in the studio involve an exploration of non-traditional communicative practices, encompassing a wide array of expressive forms from data visualization and filmmaking to coding and puppetry. Through these practices, the Lab underscores the significance of multimodal forms in the academic landscape, challenging conventional modes of knowledge production and dissemination.

Students engaged with the LL utilize the material and conceptual tools offered to navigate and construct their multimodal assignments. This participatory process not only reimagines the spatial dynamics of learning but also foregrounds the transformative potential of integrating diverse modes of academic work. 


### Timeline 
   
Each workshop will host two out of the three groups, which will be cycled from week to week. Irrespective of the eventual chronology of the workshop dates, each group will follow this timeline for their visits: 

* FIRST WORKSHOP (April 1st):
    * this workshop will function as an introduction to the LL space, people, and available tools. 
    * in terms of group work, this will be a planning meeting for future workshops and execution of the envisaged folktale collection.
* SECOND WORKSHOP (TBD):
    * plans and introductions made, the second workshop will be production-focused. 
* ADDITIONAL WORKTIME (TBD):
    * depending on group and individual needs, the LL is prepared to provide additonal worktime or hackathons for each of the three groups.

Here are all the workshop dates. "Attendees" will continually updated:
