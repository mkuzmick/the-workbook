## Project

### Topic of the video: 
- What do we see with telescopes? 
- Why do we have telescope on Earth and in Space? 

### 1st cut 

#### Talk
- Observed light
"Because light takes time to travel from one place to another, we see objects not as they are now but as they were at the time when they released the light that has traveled across the universe to us. Astronomers can therefore look farther back through time by studying progressively more-distant objects."
