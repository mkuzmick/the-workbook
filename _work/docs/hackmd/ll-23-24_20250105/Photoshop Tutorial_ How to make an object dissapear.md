And will be working with making different objects of the image dissapear


## Option 1: Select and fill tool


#### Through the Lasso Tool
1. Select the tool on the left hand side bar (third tool starting from the top), or use the shortcut "L" to use the tool
2. Draw a selection around the object that you want to make dissapear:

3. Select fill selection on the pop-up menu, and pick the color that you want to fill the selection with (*You can use the drop tool to use a color already existing in your image*). Alternatively, click generative fill and type whatever you want AI to fill your picture with. You can leave the prompt blank if you just want to fill the space with its surroundings.

4. Try different options and undo whatever you want through command+Z. Once done, press de-select to get the final result:

## Option 2: Through the object selection tool

1. Select the tool on the side bar (right under the lasso tool) or through the shortcut "W"
2. Select the object that you want to make vanish
3. Leave the prompt of the generate tool blank if you want to fill the space with whatever is on the background or type in any creative prompt to fill it in any way. For example:

## Option 3: Through content aware fill

*Note: This works best when the object is distinct from all other objects in the image and it has a different color than the background*
