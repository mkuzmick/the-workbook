# MW TO-DO


## one-off lifts/hyrbrid 

### airtable
* ideally in the majority of the tables in the bases listed above, can you clean up views? we ideally want - 

section: _READ_ONLY
-    MAIN
-    THE_MENU
-    PRINT
-    TODAY

section: WORKING_VIEWS or something else that makes sense, like "FOR_ADMIN_WORK"
* whatever else people want/what makes sense
* Helping with Airtable data entry/formula field creation
    * SLUGS
        * All underscores kebab case
        * help us come up with a good way of doing that for every table in every main base we’re using
        * Maybe planning out in hackMD and show to dani/mk for review (some you might propose would just be to manually write, some might be formula fields but they don’t necessarily have to be. Chatgpt can help with airtable formulas)


### LLUFs 
* add confirmed llufs to 
    * lluf slack user group
    * ll-llufs-23-24 slack channel
    * 
* populate in September w/ LLUFs: 
    * ll-central-hub (Members)
    * ll-event-base-23-24 (Attendees)
    * ll-projects-23-24 (Users)
    * ll-do-your-work-23-24 (Workers)
    * ll-show-your-work-23-24 (Users)
    * add them to the new slack channel for LLUFs
    * add them to user group 

### design 

* Bok website edits
* Office hours brainstorming and help.learninglab.xyz
    * Show Madeleine hover, and disconnect the help page from the canva
    * MW brainstorm what we want for a help interface
        * One form with multiple branching options?
        * Multiple forms?



## ongoing tasks 

* Daily admin help for dd+mw
    * Events
        * Adding events that happened but weren’t scheduled (DD+MW)
        * Confirming what happened and didn’t (DD+MW)
        * Separating GoogleCalAttendees into staff and clients 
        * Tagging events
        * Any events that are created with new attendees - add to attendees table

    * Projects
        * Tagging projects (DD)
        * Adding /TO correspondence logs (MW)
        * Adding /TO project folders (MW)
    * Tasks

* As needed, keep adding to tag tables
    * Tools, forms, etc.
    * add tags to those that are empty, add ongoing





# TO ASK DD/MK: 

## adding courses
* adding courses we're supporting to bok courses **including enrollment data
* linking course records to the metaprojects and projects  tables in the Projects 23-24 base

## populate in ll-central-hub
* tool images (talk to mk first)

## printing

* print all summer tasks not done or canceled
    * this is so mk/dd/mw can go over in person what we want to add to the new task base. [tasks here](https://airtable.com/appOZgrtA6p39x0mD/tblw2qHSWFA5VavYW/viwR6IvRqkLrIDB7S?blocks=hide)





# WORK ON HORIZON (but not yet)


## EMAIL TO DO 

* exemplary student project reach out 


## SYSTEMS TO DO 

### hackmd (HOLD OFF FOR NOW)
* this is a large but important task!
* we want to delete most our hackMD workspaces, but first move the hackMDs that we need to keep publicly accessible to a new hackmd team (name TBD)
    * mostly workshop docs and resources docs, and other things that look like they may have been shared

### steps
* mk confirms that all hackMDs have been backed up and added to github
* mk+dd tell staff to ONLY type in AY23-24 teams moving forward
* madeleine signs into hackMD with studio and starts moving over and deleting

### still to figure out
* how does this interact with the Documents table in ll-show-your-work, and where does that fit into this workflow

### notes
* mw could probably start with the smaller hackMD workspaces (but wait till confirmed its backed up)
