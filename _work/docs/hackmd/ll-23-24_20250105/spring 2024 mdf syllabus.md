# spring 2024 mdf syllabus

## meeting 1: intro to documentation and curation
* goals:
    * grasp fundamentals of documentation and curation to understand its significance as instructors
    * get everyone up to speed on spring projects
    * connect those projects to working groups
* activity: CD
    * jigsaw + document them learning about documentation????
    * I cut up the article and give each group a chunk
* reading: 
    * Chapter 9: Unpacking the Practice of Documentation
    * [when/why/how to give feedback - formative vs summative assessment](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/grading-and-responding-student-work)

## [meeting 2: a continuum of collections](/OPhIylNTQHaE5vxKs2z1SA)
* goals:
    * develop ways to keep track of objects (whether objects studied or documented artifacts from student learning)
    * develop schema for a database that they can add to over the course of the term (getting them thinking about eventual curation)
        * could be instances of things related to teaching/learning database that everyone contributes to?
    * learn about tools that are used to store documentation as it is created 
    * given your project and the data you're working with, what are your options for documenting
* activity: MK + DD + CD
    * MK + DD lead MDFs in building an airtable base that uses relational logic
* references:
    * [database foundations](https://www.lynda.com/SQL-tutorials/Programming-Foundations-Databases/784293-2.html)
    * [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)

## [meeting 3: the content of documentation: scaffolding activities](https://hackmd.io/EnTXQFplS7GMXTbkfmgqrQ)
* goals:
    * develop multimodal scaffolding activities that allow you to assess students learning
    * consider ways to engage students in generative learning
    * use databases to track scaffolding activities/things that students do
* activity: CD + JK?
    * each group will be assigned one of the eight generative learning strategies outlined by Fiorella and Mayer
    * each group will choose a multimodal form (explainer video, video essay, podcast, virtual gallery, graphical abstract, scientific poster)
    * each group will design a scaffolding activity that would promote generative learning in a course they're working with as an MDF
        * and that integrates SOME multimodal move
        * maybe using your phone to practice getting voiceover
        * or having students illustrate something
        * etc.
    * and that gets students to undertake a meaningful act of making in a multimodal form (in a way that helps them take a step toward a final capstone project like a video essay or podcast)
    * the LLUFs will test these!
* reading:
    * [LL scaffolding activity examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYaWtZzoIFAsBVjFDp8EbJRABTgBX9JPseMeq3IbCxs/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Eight Ways to Promote Generative Learning, Logan Fiorella and Richard E. Mayer

## [meeting 4: multimodal documentation show + tell](/pWe-qAPFRWytJgaGu4MDeQ)
* goals:
    * design ways to document student learning that draw on different modes (visual, aural, linguistic, textual, etc.)
* activity: CD and anyone else who's excited about this
    * show + tell with LLUF tested multimodal documentation

## meeting 5: celebrating (your) work
* goals:
    * develop ways to celebrate work (in this case, their mdf work but it's a model for thinking about celebrating student work)
    * develop skills in using media for storytelling
* [activity](https://hackmd.io/ZKqcA-p4TkGrhJywA6-3Ig)

## [meeting 6: storytelling about your mdf work](/co8DNsc5QHewyaie48LBqQ)
* goals:
    * get transcripts for end of year reports
    * get video artifact to share with each MDF as token of their learning
* activity: CD
    * on-camera interviews with each MDF
    * prep for your showcase, do a run-through of what you'll do at the showcase to tell the story of your mdf work
    * zero in on game plan/an idea for a mechanic to tell that story
    * focus on story part of what you really want to get across from your year as MDF

## meeting 7: curating things made and the process of making them: the showcase
* goals:
    * learn how to activate the LL space
    * prep for end of year LL showcase
* activity: JK
    * something to prep for showcase
    * thinking about how to actually use the space and plan their exhibit/space
