# Digital Recording Toolkit for HIST-LIT 93 AB

## Tips on Recording Audio

* Think carefully about your surroundings
* Obviously, other sounds around you are going to be picked up, but also think hard about what surfaces are around you. Hard, flat surfaces are going to reflect sound directly back at your microphone. 
* Soft, absorbent surfaces like pillows and blankets will have the reverse effect, preventing those reflections. 
* Both wind, and strangely enough, your own breath can be picked up, surprisingly loudly – the same is true for movement, so spend a moment to be physically aware of how you’re recording. 
* Keep an ear out for sounds you might normally block out, refrigerators, A/C units, and even some lights can be surprisingly loud.

* It’s surprisingly challenging to “edit things out”, it’s far simpler to make sure you’re recording exactly what you’d like. Never be afraid to ask an interviewee to repeat their answer to get cleaner audio.
