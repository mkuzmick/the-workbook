# event-lab-week-0

to do:
- design ILP
    - should involve teaching an LL move (like one of the functional-and-not-just-aesthetic things you can do in a medium, mapping that on to rigorous intellectual moves of academic disciplines)
- design and practice "trailer" for ILP
- define LL basics for eventLab (but also for everyone)



## when - the required stuff
* Monday: launch (9am start)
    * what are the requirements for returning MDFs?
    * what are the MDF basics we should identify, practice and communicate?
    * what is the prompt for the week?
* Tuesday/Wednesday: work, but come in for an interview
* Thursday, August 17: run through and wrap party (9am-5pm)
    * 9: coffee
    * 10, 11, 1, 2, 3: 5 lab tasters
    * 4: happy hr and reflect

## what do we want them to do
* lab planning
    * working closely with LL staff to compile docs needed for initial learning projects
* help making LL menu of options for incoming MDFs?
    * get list of all the studio mechanics we could imagine wanting new mdfs to know about as they start to design things for their depts
* doing stuff in the studio/developing mechanics and workshop ideas
    * developing new mechanics for 2023/2024
    * jessi lead us through a few things if she's here?
