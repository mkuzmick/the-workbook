## messy notes
* keep adding project plans and tasks etc.
* then the next step is getting it to be useful for people
    * Printing out on paper - checklists of single action items, 

What do we want to do to all the of the task data to make sure records are as complete as we want them to be?
-    Marlon will add things in tasks - we want to make sure we have views that shows us we need to add a project plan to it
-    And a view where things are not assigned to specific folks
-    maybe other views?
