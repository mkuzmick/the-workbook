# GAICA "cards" + media 


## GAICA cards 

**GAICAs:** Indra Islas-Luz
**Project Name:** Overhead CV Model

In this project, an AI model was developed to process overhead videos of a table, recognizing and cataloging features such as card color and orientation using Camera Vision. This model was initially trained on recorded footage and successfully extended to handle live video streams.  Recent advancements have seen the incorporation of hand signals, such as pointing, to trigger lights, colors, and animations, enhancing the interactive elements of this technology. This project serves as a prototype demonstrating how AI can be integrated into physical spaces to enhance classrooms, workshops, and lectures in real-time with novel and humanistic applications. This tangible integration of AI not only augments educational and professional settings but also promises a broader transformation in how we interact with our physical world.

**Technology Stack:** OpenCV, YOLOv7 (with Pytorch and Tensorflow), LabelImg, Scikit Learn, MediaPipe, Numpy
