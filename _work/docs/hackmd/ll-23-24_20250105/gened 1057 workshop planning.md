# gened 1057 workshop planning

## notes
1. visuals station is basically as before---marking up poem, visually translating the poem, crossing the boundaries of the poem, etc. Everyone can make things all at once and then display with combo of small studio and main table
2. audio station involves BOTH some people reading the poem aloud over the PA AND some people translating this into music or accompanying it with music (with 10 people it will be WAY easier to keep people busy with multiple audio stations: 2-3 readers, 2-3 logic people, 2-3 instrument people)
3. at the reflections station (in classroom) students practice developing the artist's statement by
    * first, by just figuring out what it might mean to cross the borders and boundaries of a poem (what are those? why would they do this?)
    * second, how would this border crossing highlight their understanding of the course themes?
    * what medium or media might they choose? why?
    * then, after 7-10 minutes on that, we turn on the audio on the big TV that is playing the activities in the other room, and they try to provide an on-the-spot rationale/artist's statement
