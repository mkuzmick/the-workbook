As you'll read on our [website](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab), the Bok Centerâ€™s **Learning Lab** is an intergenerational team and a studio space built to support creative approaches to teaching and learning. We meet with faculty to consult with them about their objectives, then we design and prototype new assignments, activities and resources for their courses.

Most of the projects we support encourage students to learn and present their ideas in new media: video essay assignments, podcasts, infographics, oral presentations, and more. But students are not merely learning *to* create in these media; they are learning *through* filming, podcasting, 3d-modeling, and so on. These new media are, like academic writing, important forms through which students can grapple with a course's material and, crucially, they are tools for *building and making* things with the data and theories and concepts and histories they are learning.
