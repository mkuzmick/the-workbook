            prompt used: "Ask ChatGPT to generate visual representations of 100 books in JSON format with titles, authors, and birth years.."
            
## description
GAI: 
Educators can use an AI tool like ChatGPT to generate sample or synthetic data structured with a specified schema for student use in class. This can be particularly useful in courses that involve data manipulation or analysis, such as computer science, data science, or digital humanities.

For example, an educator might ask the AI to generate sample JSON data for 100 books that can be used in a book annotation app. The educator can specify the structure of the data, such as: {title: ""To the Lighthouse"", author: {firstName: ""Virginia"", lastName: ""Woolf"", yearOfBirth: 1882}}. The AI can then generate a dataset that follows this structure, filling in the fields with synthetic data.

This AI-generated dataset can serve as a valuable resource for teaching and learning. Students can use the dataset to practice data manipulation techniques, such as parsing JSON data, querying data, or visualizing data. They can also use the dataset to test or debug their code, ensuring that it works correctly with different types of data.

In addition to generating data, the AI tool can also provide guidance and support as students work with the data. It can explain the structure of the data, provide tips for manipulating the data, or help troubleshoot any issues that arise.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for generating and working with synthetic data, it is important to ensure that students also have opportunities to work with real-world data. Working with real data can present unique challenges and complexities that are not present in synthetic data, and it is important for students to develop the skills to handle these challenges. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other learning activities and strategies.


We used synthetic data in this [this use-case](https://hackmd.io/hrXrYFOKTkq1_YceXz8gSA?edit), if you would like to see another example.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
