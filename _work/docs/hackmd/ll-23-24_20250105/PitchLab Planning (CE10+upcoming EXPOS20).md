## Messy Notes
### CE10
8 teams, 30 students
3 minute pitches

phases
* Story and structure with paper prototyping
    * argument of the pitch, how to structure the argument or story that a pitch is
* Creating the assets 
    * visual component with Canvas (but not a technical component)
* performance

JK in the past
* they've done a phased workshop, instead of stations.
    * step 1 - they think abot the structure and story of their pitch. talk through a few different ways of structure that structure
        * tension to resolution
        * why this, why now, why us
    * groups choose one and then work from there
    * they make a paper prototype of their team page "why us" using graphic design principles

mk new ideas etc.
* moving from their piece of paper to something sequential, so they can practice out that sequence
* can't be a pure arc, because folks need to move through vocal warm ups etc.

siriana -
* how you perform different aspects would require different types of ernest performance. tie/arry modules of performance toward the structure of the pitch
    * mk said yes. the less technical feedback they need from siriana, the more they can get feedback from their partners

jk
* could be a good candidate for tournament style share out at the end
    * mk said we could film a few winners and show them large over the PA
    * they could practice pitching to each other's phones

learning how to develop stories out of the business canvas. maybe we can have some moves or mechanics that they can identify and deploy and different moments (instead of just one template they follow)
* appeal to personal experience - could be employed at many different points of the pitch
* drawing a random card etc. - chop up their business canvas and think about how to turn this into a compelling pitch. trying a bunch of different ways
    * give them all colored cards
    * then a different color of variable cards for LL staff to hand out to get them to think about and have to do other things
    * teams could have variable cards to give others teams too!
* opening gambit of playing theatre games with the class
    * "did you get it?"
    * "here's a pen"
* there should be time to reflect - the instructors should pop in to validate the peers' judgement and also give more textured commentary and ask questions etc.
    * mk might have to come out, and maybe another person.
    * who are you going to pick, and why etc.

canva/cards would be functioning as a storyboard
* staff can add if they want to swap out cards for visuals they already know they want to use

could potentially add music

we need to be able to record their laptop if they have slides

mainly valuable to see canva templates - we can print out canva strips

flow
* come in and sit in the four zones, with their groups
* need a big open space in the middle for theatre games

mk's final thoughts-
* before they get to the vocal warmups, they really know why they're doing them
* potentially an ice breaker is cutting up their business canvas models
* for the groups, they need to have some plan and understanding about who is doing what
    * they all choose cards and have to go in that order. and then could shuffle the order or cards?
    * so developing the pieces of it and THEN doing the vocal warmups and improv-y stuff
* when demo-ing, it is cool to cut up with a knife the business model canvas

### AI possibilities
* we should record and get transcripts
* we could try to get feedback on the fly that is trained on hunt's feedback. does this new pitch cope with the advice he gave them
* live processing maybe make them canva slides??

#### prep
* printing all the business canvas (if they are in the normal card format that can be cut up, maybe printing on color?)
* dynamic mics everywhere
