## key points

- key thing is just getting cameras rolling and sent to screens for TDM, then wheeling in or switching to overheads for OEB. We don't need to record OEB, but can.
- that said, jk and arianna will decide whether they even need breakout rooms or if overheads in the main studio, small studio and classroom are enough (in which case nothing needs to happen after )
- if MW can start up Stable Diffusion, we want WAY WAY WAY more transformations of nicely-cropped eclipses
- then with other LLUFs we want more to be comfy with block-printing AI-generated elements


## tdm

- glass studio
    - record internally to c200 
    - and show that feed on the tv
- music studio
    - record internally to c200
    - and show that feed on the tv
- fireplace room
    - record internally to the c200
    - and show on tv
- small studio
    - record to drive (not all day, just for tdm student practice)
- classroom
    - record to hyperdeck as 4K pgm1 (or 8k pgm1 is fine too)

## oeb 60

- once tdm is recording we can prepare to roll the overhead rigs in to their locations for oeb60 (and if any rooms for oeb60 aren't in use we can do that then)
- jk and arianna will decide they are going to use the breakout rooms or the main space
    - if main space, roll a couple of the overhead rigs in there and connect to the rolling tv and 60" vizio on the wall
    - if using the breakout rooms, roll the overheads in between sessions and connect to tvs
    - no need to record
    - fireplace room, classroom, main studio and small studio allow for both overhead and medium shot of presenter if that's important (let's not worry about switching in the other two zones [the ones with rolling overhead rigs])


plan
* phase 1 - gather your materials
* phase 2 - practice with table as stage
* phase 3 - get comfortable on camera

### mk LLUF suggestions

- elisa: continue work on creating her image transformer/tiler as a class with less hardcoding and getter/setter methods for config/settings
- talulah & dan: help with TDM and OEB events
    - learn camera basics and keep an eye on focus and exposure in satellite rooms
    - help jk and arianna set up
- arba and allure:
    - block printing if interested? (carve versions of gai-assisted student work)
- andrei:
    - continue finding 3d tools and sharing in work 3d
- pelumi:
    -  block printing of ai-produced folk tales and eclipses
- Anya, Amelie, Samara, Julia:
    - see if JK wants to employ them in the MDF meeting for any designLab-like activities related to the showcase (we want LLUFs involved)
    - otherwise blockprinting of AI elements is great
