# Stop Motion Animation Resource

### How does stop motion animation work? 
Stop motion animation is definitely a labor of love. Most movies and videos are 24 frames per second meaning 24 pictures play consecutively in one second to appear that they're moving. Video cameras are nice enough to do that for us but with stop motion each frame is a photograph taken. This means to animate 1 minute of stop motion you'd have to take 1440 pictures! And that is without any mistakes! 

If you do not want to take 1440 for each minute of animation consider doing a lower frame rate. The motion will not be as smooth but will still look like its moving. Doing 12 frames a second rather than 24 will then only require 720 pictures rather than 1440 pictures, this is a common practice among animators.

### What tools do stop motion animators use? 
Stop motion animators will use an animating software to help keep from making mistakes. Mistakes can include: your hand being in the shot, the lighting changing, moving the puppet too far, etc. It is definitely easy to make a mistake while taking hundreds of pictures. The reason these softwares help is because of *onion skinning*. Onion skinning is the effect that allows you to see your previous frames superimposed over top of your current frame before you take the next shot. This makes it easier to go back and fix errors when they happen.

### Stop Motion Animation Applications

* Many stop motion animators use [Dragon Frame](https://www.dragonframe.com/downloads/). 
    * Dragon Frame is more advanced and has other tools that stop motion studio does not have.
* An alternative that works with iphones is [stop motion studio](https://www.cateater.com/). 



### Tips/Tricks to do stop motion studio without a giant studio! 

If you can't use these applications and you have a phone with a camera then it is still possible!

You can take a video of moving your puppet to do the motion you want and pull out the desired frames! You can do this by screenshotting the frames you want to use in your animation. Just make sure to pause and move your hands away after moving the puppet for each desired frame when filming. 

After getting all your desired images you can bring them into a video editor and make sure the duration of each image is correct. When setting this up make sure your timeline in your video editor is set to play at 24 frames per second as it is possible to change that. Each editor may call the time line something different. For example premiere calls it a "sequence".

After adding all the photos and exporting your video, you should have your stop motion animation!
