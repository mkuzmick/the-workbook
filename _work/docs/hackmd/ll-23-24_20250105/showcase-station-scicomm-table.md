# showcase-station-scicomm-table
## activities
- blockprinting
    - maybe with the theme of continuums....
        - clip art to handdrawn to hand carved and printed
        - the idea of duplicates, copies, multiples but also originals and the process of it? 
        - it's also just great for celebrating and making swag
- research concept on a card + 1 minute talk (HH style)
    - or draw a card 
    - scientific concepts that almost everyone understands (earth goes around the sun, etc.)
- then maybe from still to moving, from spatial to temporal and get into explainer videos with a few "paper characters" and a "set"...could activate the puppet corner maybe (as a metaphor at least in that when you bring these art materials in and out of camera frame to what you are saying it is like doing a live puppet show--that we move more toward this "do-it-live" model rather than a ton of segmented video clips that need to be carefully edited together--that this is getting at the key learning objectives of the course)
- unpack a model - graphical abstracts?
- duarte slideology layouts 
- graphic design in cards only
- paper to prototype to model (dylan?)
- scientific paper to poster
- dejargonify an academic phrase, couple of sentences, paragraph 
    - plus the 1 card visual??
    - with music?! 
    - can we interact with siriana and the people on stage somehow??
