* PNG to Film Strips
    * Use pages to quickly format the PNGs into film strips. 
        * to do this, create a table in pages. Then, format to the correct size and number of columns. Lastly, format the table object to move freely around the page (eliminating margins for printing)
        * simply "drag and drop" your PNGs in your preferred order into the individual cells of the table.
