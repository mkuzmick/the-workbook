# Neuro 101 eventLab brainstorming

## the ask
Emily and Christine are running a workshop for Neuro 101 about scientific presentations and posters/graphic design. Emily and Christine have a plan in place (detailed below) but were wondering if eventLab folks have ideas for ways to incorporate more of an emphasis on the performance/live nature of presentations that we could try out in this workshop.

The activity structure as of now:
* students at four tables assigned either intro, methods, results, or discussion from the paper for this week's reading
* brainstorming structure of abstract concepts
    * underline terms within the text that point towards the "move" the authors are trying to express (e.g., "compared to" or "lead to")
    * use slideology chapter to think about how ideas can be organized in space in graphics to communicate the relationships among the ideas being presented
    * use the structure selected when building the paper prototype
* paper prototyping
    * paper frame at each table acts as boundary around the slide
    * students create a visual interpretation of thee data/text in article using craft materials
    * students present on stage
