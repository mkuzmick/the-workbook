        * stuff is appearing as you're saying so if there's disconnect and what's appearing your audience is going to struggle and also you are doing to struggle as a presenter! 
        * you need to be a window not a wall-talk to your audience not the board

### activities
* Activity 1: topic you're not comfortable with
    * talk for 2 minutes on a paper with another student
    * randomly assigned topic (abstracts that Alexa/Emily bring in)- going to have to try to teach something you're not that familiar with in 2 minutes 
    * two rounds
        * first time talking only (elevator pitch for paper)
        * second time with a visual: hone in on idea of a home-base visual 
    * after each round feedback from partner
* transition to topic you're comfortable with
    * Leading up to a building a home-base visual, repeat with your own thesis topic
