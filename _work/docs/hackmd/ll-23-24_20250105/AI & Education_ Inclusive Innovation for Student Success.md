## 20231114 notes 

* framing: 
    * storytelling is amusingly at the heart of this intro-- calls to fiction and physicality in refernce to the space. 
    * AI as an equalizer: 
        * references to equity and the importance of equal access
            * again, rather amusing coming from a group of corporations 
    * AI "as magic"

                * this is what triggered the creation of Khan Academy. An essential element was student being able to learn "on demand."
    * AI 
        * AI was released without guard rails, which scared many people. Cause headlones around cheating and the "death of education"
        * He thinks that AI can be leveaged for the good of education-- just an improvement on his initial model of on-demand education, which was highly successful. 
            * they released "Khanmigo," which is powered with a chatGPT 4 API, but trained and prompted specifically for education. It doesn't "give" the answer, but helps students "get" the answer. An "ethical coach."
                * they have also created simulaions of literary characters (similar to character.ai) so students can interact eith education. They've also pushed the models to not just act in accordance with the character they are based on, but they have also prompted the models to "continue" the conversation with followup questions. 
                    * SOON to launch: writing suggestions-- a writing co-pilot. 
                * Khanmigo can also be adjusted by educators-- they can set how much or how little khanmigo assists students. 
                    * this support can actually remove cheating from academics through catching plagiarism or advising students to find more reliable sources. 
                        * potential question: how are they limiting hallucinations within their bots. Is the temperature set extremely low? does this, however, limit novel and interesting responses from the bots?

    * her lab's goal: responsibly advance socially and emotionally intelligent AI that can naturally intercact and collaborate to benefit people. 
        * this is particularly important due to the importance of early childhood education in overall human development. this is even more important due to equity concerns made worse after Covid.

                * question: but how many of these issues aren't directly related to a poor early education, but the large social framework that creates that. if AI makes economic issues that contribute to these scoial issues worse, will AI not simply be a bandaid to a circular issue it perpetuates?

I am asking questions to Cynthia Breazeal and Sal Kahn at a talk titled "AI & Education: Inclusive Innovation for Student Success". Here are their bios and notes from their talk. Please draft five academic and insightful questions that bring together the points from their talk, as well as a general theme on AI in education. 

Sal Khan bio: Salman "Sal" Amin Khan is an American educator and the founder of Khan Academy, a free online non-profit educational platform with which he has produced over 6,500 video lessons teaching a wide spectrum of academic subjects, originally focusing on mathematics and science.

Cynthia Breazeal bio: Cynthia Breazeal is an American robotics scientist and entrepreneur. She is a former chief scientist and chief experience officer of Jibo, a company she co-founded in 2012 that developed personal assistant robots. Currently, she is a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT and the director of the Personal Robots group at the Media Lab.[1] Her most recent work has focused on the theme of living everyday life in the presence of AI, and gradually gaining insight into the long-term impacts of social robots.

For both, but especially responding to Sal's Khanmigo. Our speakers have emphasized AI's use-case as an ethical coach that helps students "get" the answer rather than "giving" it to them. How do you ensure that this AI system maintains its ethical boundaries and accuracy while also promoting independent thinking and creativity among students? Pedagogigically, do you intend to avoid teaching students to simply think like a large language model? More technically, how do you up the "temperature" of a model in creative contexts without it becoming susceptible to prompt injections and hallucinations?
