# LL_SYSTEM.F23.Do Your Work-Amin-YYYYMMDD

## Admin Task Description and Notes
* keep track of observations + feature requests + things to potentially change as we go through the do your work system

## LIST
### to fix
* metaproject tags aren't working on templates
* 

### to think through
* slacks belows
    * **dani** [@marlon](https://bokcenter.slack.com/team/U0HTZUUP4) [@madeleine](https://bokcenter.slack.com/team/U04Q49VR7UH) i've been adding a lot of tasks into project plans (!!!). one quick observation that i'm noticing is a potential eventual need (![:grimacing:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f62c@2x.png) ) for metaproject books (or maybe that's just airtable?) - because i think we are separating projects that often have good+contextually important info that is relevant to the other projects for the same metaproject. ( for example, i just created a new writing task for the scrb111 multimedia project design, but previously i had made that task as part of the faculty consultation, because it came from the faculty meeting and it was part of the follow up, and then i had made it part of the workshop 1 because the email we sent would effect workshop 1. but im just realizing the consultation doc and the project design doc prob would be useful to have in the same book where someone is planning the workshop)
        * obv not saying we need to address right now, just wanted to share thoughts. i'll add to a hackMD though of things/ideas/etc. that come up as we really start using this system more and more
    * ![](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0HTW3H0V-U0HTZUUP4-8be2144be77f-48) **marlon**
        * yes--this makes a ton of sense
        * @daniduke currently all tables that link to the WorkingDocs table could generate books, but we may want to add a "CustomBooks" template ultimately? or just utility buttons that let me copy all the markdown for "all my docs" or "all this tag's docs" so that it's easier for me to create a book?
        * happy to work on this together too
        * remember that the project-plan-books are not "the real thing"--they're just one view of the thing (or things in this case)
        * and we can construct many many more views
        * but let's try to think about what the defining characteristics of those "groups-of-things" might be, because that will help us know where to put the "make-this" buttons
        * like I said to Christine, it seems to me that maybe the first need might be a per-person-link that allows each person to get an updated book of THEIR open WorkingDocs organized by project or whatever
        * also @christine was asking about what codelab should be doing with airtable, and this is where we get into that territory. @daniduke and @madeleine and I will build the basic backbone, making sure that everything gets captured and stored, but then codeLab should work on figuring out some user-centric ways of displaying info and getting input
