### note 20231128

instead of a moment-bot, we're now thinking about an ensemble in this zone. For now...

- prototype of each API
    - vision
    - text-to-speech
    - speech-to-text
    - dall-e
    - assistants
    - threads
    - completions
- needs of eventLab
    - log-every-minute
    - minute-cards
    - story of the day

### to do 20231129

create the ensemble (or at least 1 per day):

- log-every-minute-bot
- vision-bot
- voice-over-bot
- day-in-review-bot
- week-in-review-bot
- hour-in-review-bot
- minute-in-review-bot
- evaluate-photos-bot
- annotate/unpack-mk-bot
- imagine-this-moment-bot
- timeline-bot
- moment-request-bot
- history-bot
- live-logger
