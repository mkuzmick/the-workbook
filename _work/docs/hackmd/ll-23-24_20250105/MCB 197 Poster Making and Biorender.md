# MCB 197 Graphical Abstract and Biorender Workshop
## Course
MCB197
Instructor: Dr. Amanda Whipple

## Event
Location: Learning Lab Main Studio
Time: March 821  3:00pm - 4:15pm
Number of students: 40 + 3 TFs 

## Purpose
The goal of this workshop is to get students primed on the use of Biorender by pitching two final project ideas as graphical abstracts. Ultimately, this will allow them to use Biorender to prepare a poster for their final projects.

## Activities 

* Introduce students to principles of graphic design
* Talk about the structure and purposes of a graphical asbtract 
* Biorender
    * Basic figure manipulation 
    * Web-based Poster Tool
    * Power Point Extension 
* Practice making a figure from a paper in class


## General tips

### Graphic design advice
* How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
* How do the **alignment** and  **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
* How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
* What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
* Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
* Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?

Biorender also has a poster-building interface as well as a add-on for PowerPoint. 

## Graphical Abstract Example
A graphical abstract is a visual representation of the main findings or key points of a research paper or scientific article. It is designed to provide a quick and concise overview of the study, allowing readers to grasp the main concepts without having to read the entire document. Graphical abstracts typically include visual elements such as images, diagrams, charts, and other graphics to convey information in a more engaging and accessible way.
