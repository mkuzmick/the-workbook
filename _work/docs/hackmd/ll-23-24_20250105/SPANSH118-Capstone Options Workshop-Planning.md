### messy notes
* we want to retain mapping for belle

    * map annotation zone with printed maps

different ways of representing different media. providing a rationale for what they did is what this is really about.

mk said it's fine for the sections to not be identical. (we could do a similar thing as we did for city fictions for the one in the LL space)


physical materials could be there 
* as a paper prototype for something you do digitally 
* OR something that you create physically that you then bring into digital


belle could potentially have ideas around-
* flow of people that have an identity across world and borders
* and also how borders shift over time

stylized ways of mapping - trees and hierachies and
