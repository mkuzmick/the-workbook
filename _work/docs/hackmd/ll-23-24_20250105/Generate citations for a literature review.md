            prompt used: "generating citations."
            
## description
GAI: Students can utilize an AI tool to generate citations for a literature review, particularly when exploring a specific topic. For example, the main arguments against architectural modernism. The AI tool can be programmed to search through a vast database of academic articles, books, and other scholarly materials, identifying key sources that discuss this topic.

For example, the AI might find a seminal article critiquing the impersonality and uniformity of modernist architecture, or a book that explores the environmental implications of modernist design principles. The AI can then generate a citation for each source, following the appropriate citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).

In addition to generating citations, the AI tool can provide a brief summary of each source, highlighting the main arguments and findings. This can help students quickly assess the relevance of each source to their literature review and decide which ones to read in more depth.

The AI tool can also help students organize their sources. It can group sources by theme or argument, create a chronological timeline of the development of the debate, or suggest a structure for the literature review based on the sources identified.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for conducting a literature review, it should not replace critical reading and analysis. Students should still read the sources themselves, evaluate their credibility, and formulate their own understanding of the arguments. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other research skills and strategies.


## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
