# Special Teams

After you attend your Fall Basic Training Launch, you can apply for any Special Teams you would like to join.

If accepted onto a team, you will set a recurring schedule determined by your availability and the teamâ€™s needs.

For example, welcomeLab probably needs one lluf to be stationed at the welcome hub Monday-Friday from 9-5, and occasionally outside of those hours for live events. The first lluf to apply and be accepted onto a team gets to set their schedule, and the next lluf can choose from the times left available that are open, and so on until the welcomeLab schedule is full. If the team is full/schedule is full then we can have a list of reserve llufs or subs to call in for special assignments.
