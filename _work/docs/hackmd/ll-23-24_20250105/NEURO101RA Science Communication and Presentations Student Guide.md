#  NEURO101RA Science Communication and Presentations Student Guide

## Workshop Recap

* We unpacked a [model presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fk1V5NqoD4&t=2s) and discussed the features that made it effective.
* We made paper prototypes of slides about one of the sections of this week's paper. We also thought about how elements of these paper slides might be animated to better illustrate complicated ideas or emphasize important points.
* We presented on stage with the paper slides projected behind us. Slide elements moved according to pre-planned choreography.


## General tips
### Presentation advice
* How can I craft my work into a **story**? Where should I incorporate tension to increase my audience's interest in the resolution?
* How can I develop **stage presence** to be more memorable and connect with the audience?
* Did I **practice** my presentation sufficiently ahead of time? What am I going to say? How will I time my visuals to align with the script?
### Graphic design advice
* How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
* How do the **alignment** and  **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
* How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
* What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
* Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
* Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?
