# SOTS 20230922
resources are HUGE and going to be a year long project probably. so we want to make sure we're doing small things that give us satisfaction
* game mechanics - experimental base, similar in structure to the ultimate resources base
    * another table in there called carly's students' images passages etc (english149sb)
* database + repository with code stuff
* think about the back and forth between those two places, etc.
