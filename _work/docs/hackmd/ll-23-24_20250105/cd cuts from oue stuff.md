**Lecture Plan**

**9:00 - 9:15**
- REMIND students that the whole essay is due next Thursday by 11:59 pm on canvas.
- Questions about submission

**9:15 - 9:45**
- Group work
  - In pairs, students will develop a working definition of "American Exceptionalism."
  - Use either Douglass' "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July" (1852) OR Sui Sin Far's "In the Land of the Free."
  - Come up with key quotations to illustrate "American Exceptionalism."
  - Will write these on board.

**9:45 - 10:15**
- Write definitions on board (above), then refer to them for discussion.
- Note which texts pairs used to define their definition.
- Map out relationships between these two texts on "American Exceptionalism."
- Points of convergence and divergence

---

**Observations/After Class Notes**

- There ended up being a lot of questions about exporting my documents to our classes' canvas & shared Google Drive folder.
  - Especially how long it would take to upload.

- We spent a significant amount of time discussing the Chinese Exclusion Act.
  - Students were also attentive to the authors we use. A memorable pen name was the British name (Edith Maud Eaton).
    - What did this mean historically?

- Well over half the class used "Douglass" – 60%.

- Students focused on the idea that both texts hold out for the possibility of an ideal "American," even as both texts are critical of the dominant social order.

* USER: 
    * Now, I would like to create a thick description of what happened during class. Using the notes you just transcribed above, create a structured document outlining what happened in class for students who were unable to attend. Please include sections such as “main ideas, main reading, takeaways, discussion, etc.” 	Please edit or add to these proposed sections as you see fit.

### **Class Summary: American Exceptionalism in Literature**

For students who were unable to attend, here's a structured overview of the class, detailing the main points, readings, discussions, and key takeaways.

---

### **1. Introduction and Reminders (9:00 - 9:15)**

**Main Ideas**:
- Upcoming Deadlines: Reminder about the essay due next Thursday by 11:59 pm on canvas.
  
**Discussion Points**:
- Several queries were raised about the process of exporting documents to our class's Canvas and shared Google Drive folder. Particular attention was given to the duration it would take to upload.

---

### **2. Group Work & Interactive Exercise (9:15 - 9:45)**

**Main Reading**:
- Douglass' "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July" (1852) OR 
- Sui Sin Far's "In the Land of the Free"

**Main Ideas**:
- Pairs of students worked collaboratively to develop a working definition of "American Exceptionalism."
- The goal was to extract key quotations from the reading material that epitomized "American Exceptionalism."

**Discussion Points**:
- Various definitions of "American Exceptionalism" were shared by the pairs, with quotations to back up their interpretations. These definitions and quotations were then written on the board.

---

### **3. Class Discussion & Analysis (9:45 - 10:15)**

**Main Ideas**:
- A thorough comparison between the definitions provided by different student pairs.
- Exploration of the relationships between the two main readings concerning their portrayal of "American Exceptionalism."

**Discussion Points**:
- A significant portion of the class was dedicated to the discussion of the Chinese Exclusion Act.
- A memorable pen name from one of the readings, "Edit Maud Eaton," piqued interest. There was curiosity about its historical significance and relevance.
- A noteworthy observation was that a majority of the class (60%) leaned more towards Douglass's piece for their references and explanations.
  
---

### **4. Key Takeaways**

- Both texts offer the idea of an aspirational "American," emphasizing the dichotomy of the American dream and the reality.
- The readings, while holding out the possibility of an ideal "American," were also critical of the prevailing social norms and order.
- The session underscored the importance of understanding the nuances and complexities surrounding "American Exceptionalism."

## summarize or ask questions

### description
Students can use a generative AI tool to produce quick summaries of a reading, as a form of reference material. Students can submit an open-source article and ask for a summary of the piece, specifying pertinent themes, concepts, and other content the student deems necessary or helpful. Using this summary, the student could prepare for class discussion by formulating questions on their own. 

Using a generative AI tool to produce summaries of course materials could be especially fruitful in course contexts in which students need a strong foundation in the key concepts and ideas in a particular discipline or field. This could include courses across the divisions as students learn what constitutes research methods, claims, and evidence in humanities, social scientific, and scientific disciplines.

### prompt for students

Imagine you are a student in an introductory moral philosophy course, learning about the foundational concepts in this field, as well as the critical debates among scholars about the concept of moral philosophy. Because it's an introductory course, it's important that you develop a strong grasp of the core theoretical concepts and critical terrain in this field before going on to develop your own claims and insights.

Using [Laura Valenti's open-source article "Rethinking moral claims,"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jopp.12306) prompt [chatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) to help you produce a thorough but concise summary of this article. Make sure that your prompt is specific enough to get the AI to provide you with:
* a parapharse of the article's thesis
* at least 3 examples of the evidence/sub-claims the author uses to support their thesis
* some of the author's key terms and how they're specifically deployed by the author (e.g., empowerment)

Once you have a summary, use chatGPT to then ask for a handful of questions about the article that you will bring with you to discussion section.

## Deepen understanding of a concept


### description

Using an AI tool to test their knowlege, students might use the conversational or tutor-like capacities of chatGPT to ask questions that can help them clarify and thus deepen their knowledge of a particular concept. Because chatGPT is inexhaustable in its ability to answer questions, students can use this tool as a means of gaining foundational insights, asking follow-up questions about unfamiliar terminology or critical debates, and even ask chatGPT to point them to possible topics which they could then research using more conventional academic methods and materials. 

## prompt for student

Imagine you are writing a research paper about Marx's concept of alienated labor for your social studies course. Specifically, you want to understand whether Marx's theory of alienated labor can help us understand the gendered divisions of labor that have historically defined the US labor force. 
Can you prompt the AI to help you come up with:
* the core texts by Marx that discuss the theory of alienated labor and where those texts emerge in the broader context of Marx's thought
* whether there are other theories about alienated labor (i.e., by other theorists) that you might need to account for in your research essay
* a thorough description of the gendered division of labor (i.e., what this concept means and what academics have written/said about it)
* 3 - 4 key concepts, with working definitions, that you will need to research for this paper
* the types of primary data you will need for this research essay and ideas about where you will find that data

Once you complete this exercise, write a short paragraph in your own words reflecting on whether this exercise taught you something about Marx's theory that you didn't know before. 

### walkthrough with screenshots

[add screenshots here from chatPDF and chatGPT, including your prompts]

### instructor tips
* Because this exercise encourages students to deepen their knowledge, they will likely need specific prompt/question ideas and parameters from the instructor *before* they go to chatGPT. This will help guide students toward that deeper understanding in a manner that aligns with assignment or course goals.
* Students should already have a pretty well-defined/specified topic in mind by the time they go to prompt the AI, to ensure that they are actually moving into the critical terrian of a subfield (rather than just producing summaries on broad topics).
* Students might workshop prompts together as a means of giving each other feedback on the types of questions that inform the research process (even when that research process starts with an AI tool, rather than traditional academic sources).

### discipline-specific use cases
As students develop baseline competency in a particular field, it can be useful for them to begin to develop proficiency in a particular topic or concept. This has conventionally been one of the goals of the academic essay, namely encouraging students to home in on a particular concept (say, from a theoretical text) and apply that concept to a work or small sampling of works. In a humanities context, this exercise typically intends to help students develop an original insight that is informed by the significant ideas that comprise the critical discourse in a particular domain. In the social sciences and sciences, it might be a means for students to analyze a given dataset and apply that understanding to solving a problem or answering a question.
