# TS260 Interviewing for Podcasts Workshop plan

## key info
- Where: Bok Center Learning Lab
- When: Tuesday, Oct 24, 6-8 PM

## plan

### people
* staff lead:
* activity leads: Lara Norgaard and Dr. Tom Wisniewski
* participants: TS 260 students (mandatory)
### goals

The work of a literary translator does not end with a finished manuscript or a contract with a publishing house. Translators, like authors, advocate for their work as active participants in a literary scene, which involves speaking in a range of public-facing settings. 

This workshop at the Bok Center Learning Lab is an opportunity for students to experiment with different modes of public communication about literary translation. How can you modulate the way you read your translation depending on if the setting is live or recorded? In what ways can you frame your author for an audience unfamiliar with the source literary tradition? What is your theoretical framework for selecting and translating literary works, and how will you use that framework to express an engaging, critical narrative about your trajectory as an emerging translator?

### activites/tests

Students will experiment with reading their work in live and recorded settings and interview each other in a professional podcasting studio. The class will then be introduced to the basics of podcast script-writing and shape their own interview transcripts into concise and effective narratives.

(Preparation prior to class: students will listen to/watch an episode of their choice from each of the following platforms: the Three Percent Podcast, BookBlast, and Translators Aloud. Students should reflect about what they found effective (or not so effective) about each of these public-facing communication styles, which vary in terms of medium, length, interview/hosting style, target audience, etc. Additionally, students will prepare for the interview portion of the workshop. They should be ready to both ask and answer questions about two general topics: (1) how they found their source text and chose to translate it into English, and (b) a puzzle in the source text and how they approached it in their translation. To prepare, students will brainstorm a list of more specific questions around each of the two topics so that they can lead an effective interview with their peers during the workshop, and everyone will come ready to speak on their feet about their own work. They will  bring their translations and source texts with excerpts and examples dog-eared for easy reference.)

### schedule

| Time | Action |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| 6:00     |  Introduction. Students are split into two groups of 3 or 4. We explain that students will experiment with different modalities for presenting their work as literary translators. Group 1 will experiment with a live "cafe-style" reading with rapid-fire Q/A from their peers and a video recording of their reading. Group 2 will interview each other in the podcasting booth. | 
| 6:10     |  Each member of Group 1 reads in the live "café" for 4-5 minutes. Then they read in the video booth for 4-5 minutes. Students take notes on how live presence and recorded video affect the experience of the reading. Members of Group 2 take turns interviewing each other for 8-9 min with either Lara or Tom in the small recording studio. Students not in the interview observe, taking note of what is going well and what could be improved. | 
| 6:45     |  Groups switch stations. Repeat activities from the earlier step. Learning Lab staff begin printing the transcripts from the interviews.   | 
| 7:20     |  Both groups gather and reflect. What were the most effective strategies for communicating about translation depending on the medium? What did students feel worked well, and where would they like to improve? In the meantime, Learning Lab staff finish printing transcripts|
| 7:30     |  Transcripts from the podcast-style interviews are distributed. Students are told that they have 20 min to craft a ~3 min podcast script from their 8-9 min interviews. They are told that an interviewer won't appear on the audio track as the host, so the sections they are free to write are the interview questions, a short introduction to frame the conversation, and credits at the end of the episode. Everything else should be cut with scissors from the transcript and pasted onto their script document. 
|7:50     |  Students share their final scripts in pairs or groups of three. They reflect on what was difficult, generative, or interesting about the script-writing process and discuss how they might approach recorded interviews differently after knowing what the script-writing process looks like.
