## The Intersection of Technical and Interpretive Skills in Video Essays: A Workshop Report
### Introduction

The workshop, focusing on the concepts of layering and compositing in video essays, aimed to bridge the gap between technical and interpretive skills in the context of anime and Japanese cinema. The workshop was designed to help students understand the intricate relationship between form and content in video essays, and how these elements could be manipulated for effective storytelling and argument-making.

### Workshop Structure

The workshop was divided into three stations, each with a unique focus:

1. Paper Prototyping: This station was designed to help students visualize their arguments using simple tools like paper, scissors, and knives. The aim was to encourage quick ideation and prototyping without the need for complex technical tools. The students were shown how to cut out characters from an environment and place them into different settings, thereby making different claims about the character and recomposing the shot.
2. Digital Tools: At this station, students were introduced to a range of digital tools used for layering and compositing, from simple ones like Canva and iMovie to more complex ones like After Effects, Blender, and Adobe Premiere. The objective was to familiarize students with the tools used by filmmakers and animators, and how these tools could be used to analyze, interpret, and make arguments about films.
3. Recreating a Shot: The final station provided students with a hands-on experience of constructing a piece of cinema that involves layering and compositing. Students were tasked with recreating a shot from the movie Godzilla, which involved manipulating multiple foreground, background, and middle ground elements.

### Rationale for the Workshop

The workshop was designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the technical and interpretive aspects of creating video essays. It aimed to help students appreciate the intricate relationship between form and content in video essays, and how these elements could be manipulated for effective storytelling and argument-making.
The workshop also aimed to encourage quick ideation and prototyping without the need for complex technical tools. This approach was based on the belief that when developing ideas, it is more beneficial to work in a medium that allows for quick and fluid iterations.
The use of digital tools was introduced to familiarize students with the tools used by filmmakers and animators, and how these tools could be used to analyze, interpret, and make arguments about films.
The final station provided a kinesthetic experience of constructing a piece of cinema, which is believed to provide a more profound understanding of the concepts of layering and compositing than merely analyzing or viewing a film.

### Connection to Video Essays

The workshop was designed to prepare students for the task of creating video essays. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the technical and interpretive aspects of creating video essays, the workshop aimed to equip students with the skills necessary to create compelling and insightful video essays.

### Conclusion

The workshop successfully demonstrated the intersection of technical and interpretive skills in the creation of video essays. It provided students with a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of layering and compositing, and how these elements could be manipulated for effective storytelling and argument-making. The workshop also highlighted the importance of quick ideation and prototyping, and the use of digital tools in the creation of video essays.
