## OVERVIEW

Welcome to the Learning Lab! Our studio, supplies, and people are here to support you as you work on your group projects for Comp Lit 200 this month.

Here are the key steps:

* FIRST WORKSHOP (TBD):
    * during this workshop will introduce you to the LL and the materials and people who are here to help you
    * you will be encouraged to work together as a group to develop your production plan (and, in particular, to determine whether you may need to use any resources we have or resources we can quickly source for you)
* SECOND WORKSHOP (TBD):
    * during your second visit (on either April 8 or April 15) we can have the space set up with the materials and tools required for you to work as a team on your project (i.e. computers with software and API keys installed, block printing supplies, cardstock, etc.) 
* ADDITIONAL WORKTIME (TBD):
    * if you would like to come back as a group to work together in the space or set up time to capture media in our studios, you can contact learninglab@fas.harvard.edu and we would be delighted to host you if we can schedule a time (note: we are holding Monday afternoons even after the first 3 workshops)
