# Bot "Report" Concept 

The essay, as a piece of technology, has been the default form of academic assessment for several hundred years (though others might argue that other, often oral, forms have existed for millenia). The rhythms and mechanisms of the essay are rote, familar, but not equipped to meet the task of holistically assessing the assignments of the future. 

Instead of attempting to preserve the essay, in its current format, can can forge ahead with new “machines” for transferring learning, thought, and work. 

If you were assigned to create an AI "bot," how would you communicate your process and and resulting creation? If you made a bot, how would you “turn that in?" How could this be assessed by your instructor and peers?

Enter, the “bot report.” 

--- 

This is a a design challenge for the multimodal presentation of an increasingly multimodal entity-- the "bot." This is a draft, and has many modular pieces that can be changed, scrapped, or added onto for specific use-cases. 


### 1. Digital Portfolios
**Objective**: To assess students' technical skills and creativity in creating their bot, while also documenting and curating their proccess for viewers [insert something here from marlon and christine's very long reading list on the importance of documentation and meta-documentation]. 

**Structure**:
- **Content**: Each portfolio should include (but is not limited to):
   - **Written Explanations**: Describing the bot's functionalities, design decisions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
       - This should also include WHY the student is pursuing a bot with this functionality. Why should it be a bot? Where does this improve human generation or manual operations?
  - **Code Snippets**: Highlighting key parts of the bot's code, with annotations explaining the logic and purpose.
  - **Screenshots/GIFs**: Visual documentation showing the bot in action, responding to commands, or interacting in Slack.
  - **Written Reflections**: A section where students discuss what they learned, potential improvements, and future possibilities for their bot.
- **Format**: Portfolios could be created as digital documents (like a hack.md or python notebook),interactive websites, or even a series of social media posts.
- **Presentation**: Students could present their portfolios in class or share them with the course community online for wider visibility.

### 2. Bot Interaction Logs
**Objective**: To evaluate the bot's performance and the student's ability to analyze and interpret interaction data.

**Structure**:
- **Submission of Logs**: Students submit logs that record interactions with their bot over a period. This could also be an appendix to their Digital Portfolio, demonstrating "optimal" use of the bot, according to their creator. 
    - This is similar to the process Christine and I went through while making AI use-cases for faculty, but presenting outputs from the bots below
    - This is especially important with AI bots, as, unlike almost all other human creations, the output between users is never exactly the same. 
        - This limits replicability, and also add more weight to the mechanism of prompting the bot, almost as much as building it. Therefore, logs are essential to demonstrate the intended use. 
            - However, students should also demonstrate that they experimented with prompting, and added code to help prevent everything from accidental misuse to intentional prompt-injecting. 
- **Analysis Report**: This could also, depending on the class, go into data-science territory, if students were required to accompany the logs with a report analyzing:
  - **Bot's Responses**: Evaluating the appropriateness and accuracy of the bot's responses.
  - **Error Handling**: How the bot handles incorrect or unexpected inputs.
  - **USER DATA**: Data on user use 
      - this is almost certainly out of the purview of student assessment, until API calls get far cheaper and ONLY if the bot was used enough to get a corpus of data. But maybe GPTs give you data on broader use? 


### 3. Peer Review and Feedback
**Objective**: To foster a collaborative learning environment and develop critical thinking and communication skills. And, well, peer review is an excellent motivator.

**Structure**:
- **Small Group Presentations**: Students present their digital portfolios to a small group of peers.
- **Feedback Sessions**: After each presentation, peers provide constructive feedback, focusing on aspects like functionality, creativity, usability, and documentation.
- **Peer Use**: Depending on the constraints of the class (namely, the API call budget), I would then encourage everyone to turn their slack bot on-- or share their colab link-- so peers can test out one another bots. 
    - This should range from good-faith use to prompt-injecting.

This is another idea, which would be really dependent on the types of bots and the skill of the people taking the course. 


### 4. Gamified Challenges
**Objective**: To test the bots' capabilities in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios, encouraging creative problem-solving. 

So, you made a bot AND you made a digital portfolio? Amazing. Duplicate that file and get ready to mess it all up. It's hack-a-thon time, baby. 

**Structure**:
- **Challenge Design**: Create a set of challenges or scenarios that bots must navigate. These could range from simple query responses to complex problem-solving tasks.
    -  Again, perhaps a hack-a-thon style format? This would probably constitute a final of some sort, as I can imagine this would be difficult and nervewracking. 
    -  This is also incredibly variable depending on the types of bots originally made for the class and the parameters set for their functionalities. 
- **Performance Metrics**: Set clear metrics for evaluation, such as response time, accuracy, and creativity of responses. Again, I imagine that this would be very similar to a hack-a-thon, so many structural conventions could be adpted from there.

## potential addition: 

* I could also include an example of a digital portfolio made in hack.md of one of my bots and slowly collect more examples. 
    * but we may not have time/utility to do this, so I'll wait before undertaking any further additions.
