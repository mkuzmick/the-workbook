Some concepts from Discipline and Punish

## instructions
1. Look at your concepts from Discipline and Punish. You're going to teach this term in its relationship to the overall argument of the book.
2. Consider how they relate to the overall argument of the book. How does your passage help us understand the shift from discipline to punishment that Foucault charts?
3. Look at your random object that another group assigned to you. 
4. Design a three-minute presentation that helps us understand your passage **in relation to the totality of the book**. Make sure to incorporate: your passage, the random object from another gorup, any concepts you've been assigned, and any other relevant passages and ideas from the text.
5. Sprinkle in generously analogies: historical, cultural, aesthetic, etc. These analogies are crucial tools to help your audience understand Foucault.
6. Make a key illustration that helps us understand what you want us to understand about Foucault.
7. Plan and create for 1 hour.
8. Serve!
