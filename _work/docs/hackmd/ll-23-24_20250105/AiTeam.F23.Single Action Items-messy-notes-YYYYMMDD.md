# AiTeam.F23.Single Action Items-messy-notes-YYYYMMDD

## messy notes


* CHRIS: 
    * The conversation is being framed as both a way to change the world, improve the world, allow insane academic power. However, also a highly disruptive tool. 
    * It will take academia ten years to deal with this (two years of students "going wild", two-three years for professors to figure out how to use it for students and themselves, five years for administrators to make policies around it)



* AMANDA: 
    * three key principles: 
        * imperative we maintain the integrity of the education we offer
            * we need to maintain "sweat equity"
            * helping faculty adopt assignments 
        * responsible and effective AI use in the classroom 
            * you can use AI to help students deepen and understanding of a concept 
                * used to change frameworks, generate questions 
                * Amanda mentions the CS50 chatbot
                    * a way to reinforce lower-level skills, while higher levels skills are left to the human element 
                        * *NOTE: odd lack of conversation on hallucinations*
        * third point? 
            * think of the transformation, the ability to think abotu this change across discipline. As Chris said re: the transformative power of this tech, this is a cultural transformation that can be seen as a corely liberal arts 


* CLAIRE: 
    * class of 2016, CS and psychology 
    * Enormous benefit and harm, with applications across, well-- *everything*. 
        * Partnership of AI, made by tech leaders at huge companies who recognize that AI issues would transcend instituions and sectors. 
            * They create guidance and policies 
            * How to evaluate tradeoffs
                * social and techical expertise in these tools. 
    * What's different about this? 
        * why is this different than computers? "Natural born cyborgs" This is an extension of that. 
            * However, we are not only learning about AI, but this is learning too. Even learning *more* (according to Karim). 
            * This is something that grows as our knowledge does (will we catch up?)
                * re an example: a media label (block chain) to certify content was proposed by tech workers, if you study psychology, you know that can have no or even the opposite effect. 
            * Governance: 
                * use-cases need to be the center of this, how to engage citizens in this governance (therfore, how to engage students)


* KARIM: 
    * HBS: digital data design institue at Harvard 
    * He has slides, he wrote "competing in the age of AI"
        * reflects on the model of "divisions," for instituions, and how that comes against AI
        * navigating thr jagged technological frontier: field experimental evidence BCG
            * AI combined with humans, how to leverage 
                * productvity jumped 25%, 40% higher quality, those below average performance improved by 43%. 
                * AI-collaboration models: 
                    * two wrokflows emerged "Centaurs" (task dvision between human and AI) and "Cyborgs" (integrated workflow with AI)
                    * so they became "better bullshitters"
                        * LOL at the consulting roast 
        * three approaches to AI: 
            * replacement, augmentation, transformation 
                * paralegals becoming as good as LAw school professors, nurses as good as physicians 


* ISAAC: 
    * med school professor, studied comp sci in the 80s. 
        * created. anew medical journal tracking the use of AI 

* QUESTIONS: 
    * lack of equity in terms of access 
        * chris stubbs: comparing a cat to a dog 
*race ad medicine:; 

epmowering those who didn't use tools before 

"handling a toddler a chainsaw"

the tool is also flawed-- it provides strong frameworks: 


the failure point: the people become some dependent on mahcines, we would fail. 


needs domain expertise 


nature versus science: the.

 keep stoking the public conversation 
 
 
 
 student bar fundamental responsibility for what they submit 
 
 
 
 SYNTHETIC DATA: as a way to get more data that is more honest, more equitable than the real data we are able to get
