### Notes from the Instructor

**SarahE**: @daniduke I wanted to check in about the two days my class will be in the learning lab. Last fall, I did a quick check in with you --but am hoping to have a similar agenda for this year’s sections. In Monday class there are 7 students for Mon Nov 6 and 9 students for Tues, Nov 7.  Last year, Marlon did some activities with the students in the space about preparing to present/using the green screen, and then each student stood up, gave a short 3 minute self-intro that was recorded. Will that work for this year as well?


**daniduke**: hi @SarahE can you refresh our memory about what they're presenting so we can remember which activities would be useful for them? do you want @marlon to give any tips on presenting or should he just explain how to use the green screen?  our notes from last year indicate you wanted us to focus on public speaking/on stage delivery, just let us know if that's still the case. Last year's session flow, from our meeting notes-  

-   MK introduction
-   Students introduce themselves and write their names on the card
-   MK talks about public speaking and visuals as creating more memorable experiences (and presenting as giving us a tour of a conceptual space, leading us from point to point to point, trying to get us excited about why they matter, NOT about memorizing, but responding in the moment)
-   Students then create 2-3 cards/visuals they want to tie into their introduction
-   Then they can present on stage with a microphone, and we film it.

**SarahE**: They are going to practice a 1.5 -3 minute self-introduction. The focus on NOT memorizing content is something we’ve been talking about a lot! We will have practiced introducing ourselves in different ways in a previous lesson. The above session flow should work great, though this year, one group is larger. I thought last year’s flow was terrific and the students love it, so I’m happy to do the same thing again. If it would be helpful for me to provide more details beyond the above notes you shared, let me know. The class is practicing fluency skills and confidence building, as well as comprehensibility strategies (both pronunciation and public speaking).
