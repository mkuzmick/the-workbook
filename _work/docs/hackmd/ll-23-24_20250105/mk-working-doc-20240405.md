### eclipse mechanics?

- upstairs?
- on-the-spot generation? (to get over the hump and just do something quick?) maybe see if a couple of people per group want to join us for a sprint?

#### gpt:

Certainly! Here are some examples of folk tales and myths from various cultures that involve solar eclipses:

- **Chinese Mythology**: The dragon or celestial dog, often called "Tian Gou," was believed to eat the sun during an eclipse, prompting people to make loud noises, such as banging pots and pans, to scare away the creature and restore light.

- **Vietnamese Mythology**: Similar to Chinese mythology, the Vietnamese believed that a giant frog was swallowing the sun during an eclipse.

- **Hindu Mythology**: The demon Rahu is said to be responsible for chasing the sun and moon, and occasionally catching and swallowing them, which results in an eclipse. The gods make the demon release them when they cut off Rahu's head, causing the eclipse to end.

- **Ancient Greek Mythology**: They interpreted eclipses as a sign of divine displeasure and often associated them with bad omens or angry gods who needed to be appeased.

- **Norse Mythology**: It was thought that the sky wolves, Sk√∂ll and Hati, who chase the sun and the moon, would occasionally catch them, causing an eclipse. People believed that the eclipse would end when the wolves were scared away.

- **Korean Mythology**: The mythical dogs "fire dogs," or "bul-gae" in Korean, try to steal the sun or moon but end up spitting them out because they're too hot, thus causing the eclipse.

- **Native American Mythology**:
   - The Pomo, an indigenous group of people from the northwestern United States, have a myth of a bear who walks through the sky and meets the sun. They get into a fight, leading to the sun becoming darkened (eclipse). After making peace, the bear would continue to walk and meet the moon, leading to a lunar eclipse.
   - The Ojibwe people would shoot flaming arrows into the sky to reignite the sun during an eclipse.

- **African Myths**:
   - The Batammaliba, from Togo and Benin, believed that an eclipse signaled a conflict between the sun and the moon and saw it as a time of coming together and resolving old feuds and anger.
   - In some parts of Africa, it was believed eclipses occurred when the sun and moon were fighting. The people could encourage reconciliation by settling their differences as well.

- **Ancient Babylonian Mythology**: The eclipse was seen as an omen, often interpreted by priests to predict the death of a king. Substitutes would be made to sit on the throne as decoys to protect the real king.

- **Ancient Mayan and Aztec Cultures**: They saw an eclipse as a bite being taken out of the moon or sun. In Aztec mythology, a solar eclipse was indicative of the gods' displeasure, requiring human sacrifices to appease them and restore the celestial order.

These are just a few tales and myths; many cultures have developed their own interpretations to explain the natural phenomenon of solar eclipses.
