- GenEd 1057 Workshop
- Herschbach Lecture
- CompLit 280x prep

## GenEd 1057 Workshop Prep

- [gened 1057 workshop planning](/Cl-OwAzkRqyZoSRmxoMuBQ) doc
- 3 stations
    - visuals => jk?
    - audio => mw and siriana?
    - reflections/rationales => cd + TF?
- audio
    - stage w/ PA
    - instruments & amps
    - logic into PA
    - spectrogram into the ATEM, integrated onscreen (ME2 stable?)
- visuals
    - poems
    - art supplies
    - knives and scissors and other tools for transgressing boundaries
    - ME1 as complex comp that can sometimes involve ME2, often just talent over table
- reflections
    - ME1 or grid coming in
    - on mute to start
    - then with audio
    - mix well

## CompLit 280x Prep

- array of web-based poem examples 
    - maybe a few that simultaneosuly span multiple mirroring timescales (in ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny fashion)
        - the trajectory of the 2 hour workshop that gets them from where they are now (colab) to where they want to go (cool web or printed version of their work)
        - which also mirrors their own potential skill growth over a term to 4 year length of time if they decide to keep going with their project
        - and the history of web dev itself, moving from the 90s index.html + styles.css era through AJAX to node/express and then react + next etc etc
    - (no need to actually say anything about this, but a secretly resonating harmonic system like this will pay off with mental models clicking into place, moments of insight, etc etc)
    - so maybe start with a single html file of just the text of the poem produced in colab with various relevant choices being made when parsing text and creating the markup.
    - like

    - then multple html files generated from an array of poems
    - then that leads you to think of the need for templating and/or components libraries
        - express + ejs, say as a way to do this
        - then react as the thing that's been the most popular over the last several years 
- printouts of a few of the above?
- MAYBE a bot (just to look at and gesture towards the idea that we COULD run a workshop or even just a one-on-one consult for anyone who wanted to build a quick slackbot)

## lluf work

### sd and block printing
- block printing and stable diffusion continue to be needs.
- for SD, we will now settle for 12 or even 8 steps from our overhead, cropped so that the sun is 1/3 the width of the frame, output as square 1024x1024
    - then generate at least 8 things for each of those 8 and save with a naming convention that MW and DD specify
    - then for bonus points create prints from 8
- 

### event prep

- help Christine and Jordan and Madeleine get ready for the Gen Ed workshop, practice setting things up and using the stations, etc
- Clarissa can also help during the event

### code

- maybe Joel in the afternoon can work a little on code for 280x (MK can say more if we want to do this)

### end of year prep

- llufs with extra time on their hands can start slacking their favorite media or ideas/thoughts of the year in their individual channels to prep for a final on-cam show and tell. 
    - it's fine to just resend slacks to that channel
    - it's fine to resend from img-2-md and other work channels
    - also fine to just type sentences
- there are also a couple of space-related things they could help out with
    - try to use some of the oddest and smallest leftover chunks of the stone fabric to construct a rainbow light above one of the shelves in the classroom (once we approve then we'll line the tops of the walls with this mechanic for the showcase)
        - there's a light you can use for this in the dark corner between the main studio door and the control room door
        - if you want to make another, the matching lights are leaning against the studio wall, and matching cables can be found hanging in the control room (ask MW or DD for help)

### buttons for p&p
