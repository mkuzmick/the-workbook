We'd like to have a detailed inventory of everything that is being stored and where it's being stored. So we're looking for the level of granularity of:
* fireplace room
    * main white shelves
        * from the bottom, shelf 1:
        * shelf 2:
        * shelf 3:
    * long and low cabinet
        * left drawer
        * right drawer
    * other shelves
        * from the bottom, shelf 1:
        * shelf 2:
        * shelf 3:
        * etc.

and with your help, you will list and describe all of the items being stored in each thing!
