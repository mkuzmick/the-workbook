# Transcription Resource for HIST-LIT 93 AB

There are loads of methods to automatically transcribe audio and video recordings. The most important thing to know is that AI transcription systems are far from perfect, and tend to have a scaling range of accuracies. The biggest take-away from this is that you should **always review your transcript before declaring it finished**. 

## Freely Available Transcription Tools

There's a number of options that you can access, especially as students here. 

* Zoom
	* This is an obvious choice, it live-transcribes your recording, so just make sure it's open as you're recording and your transcript will be mostly generated for you. 
	* [Check here to make sure that your account has transcriptions enabled.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4409311220621-Enabling-or-disabling-audio-transcription-for-cloud-recordings-)
* Adobe Premiere 
	* This is option a bit unusual, but Adobe Premiere has a great ML driven transcription tool. It also allows you to edit the video based on the corresponding transcript, which can be helpful if you need to edit your media as well as generate a transcript. 
	* [You can find instructions on how to use this tool here.](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/text-based-editing.html)
	* [And if you don't already have your Adobe account set up, you can find instructions here.](https://huit.harvard.edu/adobe-creative-cloud)
* Youtube
	* You may already be hosting your media on Youtube, if you are this could be a convenient option. Youtube generates subtitles for every video you upload, it just may take up to an hour or so to populate.
