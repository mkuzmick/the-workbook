# HMS_MMH Workshop 1 plan

## key info
- Where: Studio
- When: 20230915

## plan

Quick intro - then three stations - then a share out
- Interactive video station (maybe carol/christine?)
	- Play a clip, show them how to do something from the clip (ground in an example, and then they can try)
	- [Vox's How Taiwan held off Covid-19, until it didn't](https://youtu.be/0fhaEIlGux4)

- Interactive audio station (maybe casey)
	- Play a clip, show them how to do something from the clip (person on the street, host recording, radiolab, etc.) - could do mic taste test, or could be about process of editing
	- [Vox's New Variant Just Dropped](https://megaphone.link/VMP9275753825)

- Social media+web station
	- We’ve pulled down from social media campaigns from public health campaigns and similar things, and had a station where they talk through things like that (maybe madeleine can help)
And then students can share out - is there something that really resonated?
