### dd guide for showcase setup

- always rubber mallet on truss by default
    - if resistance, determine what and try other moves
    - if aim not good enough to hit pin with 100% accuracy, seek assistance
- no cable ties on cables once in operation
- leave 3 cams up on dollies
    - 2 c200s on good heads
    - 1 heavier duty rig on heavy-duty tripod remaining at eye-level for standing/stool-sitting people
