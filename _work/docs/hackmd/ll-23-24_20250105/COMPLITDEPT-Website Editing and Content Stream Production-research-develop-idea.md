# COMPLITDEPT-Website Editing and Content Stream Production-research-develop-idea

## Description and Notes

### Context
Comp Lit would like Lara to develop a graduate student-facing event that helps graduate students integrate different media into short-form videos and other web content so that they can share their research to a broader public audience.

### Deliverables
Graduate students will be able to:
Identify public-facing, multi-modal forms of communication that best suit their research
Think strategically about how best to use the Comp Lit website as a platform for their research, works in progress, events, etc. while furthering the goals of the site itself
Optional: brainstorm a specific idea to contribute to the website in the next calendar year
