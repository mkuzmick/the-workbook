#  Graphic Design Resource for PSY980T: Eating Disorders



## Workshop Recap
We are excited to work with you on your infographic assignment! Here's a quick recap of what we did during the workshop:

### intro & visual communication moves 
- For this assignment you have a choice to communicate your academic ideas through different forms: the brochure, the infographic, the zine, the social media post. 
- from academic moves of writing to move of visual communication. aesthetic=functional
- to choose the most effective form, think about both the content and the audience-what will best support what you are trying to communicate, and what form will your audience best connect to?

### sourcing and analyzing models

Once you decide on the most effective form, it can be incredibly helpful to find really successful models of the form out there in the world. Doing a close reading of one(or more) of these models can help us know what works and what doesn't, and give us some structure as we venture on to create our own!

* We found models of posters and social media posts online and shared the graphical design elements that made them effective.  We also pointed out ways we might edit the models to make them more clear. Some questions we posed as important considerations when generating infographics were...
    * How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
    * How does the **alignment** and the **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
    * How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
    * What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
    * Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
    * Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?
    * When using tools like Canva, how can I avoid being pushed into a maximalist design in which graphics distract rather than support the big ideas?
   



- it can also be very helpful to pitch your idea to one of your peers to see what questions they might have or what feedback they can give you and how that might inform your process going forward. Talk to your peers about your models. Why this model? what do you like/not like about it as a form? What are some graphic design choices that are either working for or against the content that's being communicated? 
You can also find some examples of models in #sourcing-media
    - Questions to consider while looking at examples: What do you notice? What is being communicated? Where does your eye go first?
   
### prototyping   
We did an activity in which we prototyped the final project for the class.  
- Many students experimented with the tool Canva as a way of getting started in designing their final projects.
- Some students also prototyped physical graphical forms such as zines using paper and other craft supplies.
