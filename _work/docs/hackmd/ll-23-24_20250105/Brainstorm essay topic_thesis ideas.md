            prompt used: "Brainstorm essay topic/thesis ideas"
    

## description
Students can use AI tools to get ideas about essay topics or to get help developing a thesis statement. Because AI tools can generate a significant amount of text very quickly, it could be useful for students to experiment with asking an AI for a range of thesis statement "types" (e.g., compare/constrast, centrality of something conventionally considered marginal, theoretical intervention in a scholarly debate, application of specific theory to a new dataset/cultural object/etc.).

Depending on the course goals, this type of engagement with AI might give students too much information. You might want to set guidelines for appropriate or inappropriate use. 

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.

4. First, type your questions and/or your prompt for the AI. Remember: 
    * If you only hit Enter or Return, this will automatically submit your prompt. 
    * You can also add three ticks (''') to indicate a paragraph break if you prefer.
5. For this activity, tell chatGPT (or whichever tool you choose) about a general area you'd like to research. 
6. Ask the AI to provide you with three essay topic ideas.

7. Select one of those essay topic ideas and ask the AI to provide you with three models of thesis statements about that topic.

## Transcript of activity example:

* USER:
    * I would like to study the Voynich manuscript and the cryptographic style of the writing. Please generate three essay topic ideas on this topic.
* AI: 
    * "Decoding the Enigma: An In-depth Analysis of the Cryptographic Style in the Voynich Manuscript" - This topic could explore the unique cryptographic style of the Voynich manuscript, comparing it to other known cryptographic styles and discussing why it has been so difficult to decipher.
    * "The Voynich Manuscript: A Case Study in Historical Cryptography" - This topic could look at the Voynich manuscript as a historical artifact, exploring what its undeciphered status tells us about the evolution of cryptography and the challenges faced by cryptographers in the past.
    * "Unsolved Mysteries: The Role of the Voynich Manuscript in Modern Cryptography" - This topic could discuss how the Voynich manuscript continues to influence and inspire modern cryptography, despite (or perhaps because of) its undeciphered status. It could also explore any modern attempts to decipher it using new cryptographic techniques or technologies.
* USER: 
    * I like your third topic, "Unsolved Mysteries: The Role of the Voynich Manuscript in Modern Cryptography" best. Can you provide me with three models of thesis statements about that topic?
* AI: 
    * "Despite remaining undeciphered, the Voynich Manuscript serves as a significant influence in modern cryptography, inspiring new techniques and technologies in the field. This thesis will explore the manuscript's enduring impact and the contemporary efforts to decipher it."
    * "The Voynich Manuscript, with its unique cryptographic style and undeciphered status, continues to challenge and inspire modern cryptography. This thesis will investigate the role the manuscript plays in shaping current cryptographic methods and the ongoing attempts to unravel its mysteries."
    * "The Voynich Manuscript, an enigma of historical cryptography, remains a source of inspiration for modern cryptographers. This thesis will delve into how the manuscript's unsolved status fuels advancements in cryptographic techniques and the contemporary endeavors to decode it."
