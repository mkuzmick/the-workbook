# de/generative AI image-to-text loop

## PREMISE 
Using a closeup of a Bernini sculpture, *Rapimento di Proserpina*, we used a loop of OpenAI's camera vision in chatgpt4 and Midjourney to create a loop of image generation and image analysis. 

*This can help students examine their own written descriptions of visual mediums, as well as the forms constructed from them.*
