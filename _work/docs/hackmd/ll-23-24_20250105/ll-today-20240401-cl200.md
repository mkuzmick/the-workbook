# ll-today-20240401-cl200
## plan for April 1

and other days.


### MOVES

As a design studio focusing on the multi-modal production of academic thought, we possess a wide range of "tools." These tools vary in technological medium and application, but all could serve to realize your folktale collections. 

Before moving into specific tools, we'll ground these tools in "moves." [define moves?] @69KbkXktQMSRAwsk63p5uw 

These moves shape we think aboput these tools and employ them in pedagogy and "making" more broadly: 

all you marlon @69KbkXktQMSRAwsk63p5uw :
- constraints
       - recursion and ensembles
        - physical and digital media, human and artificial intelligence, analog and digital capture



### cl200 prep tasks

- move computers to one side of each station
- confirm cameras running into the system and identify here
    - table 1
        - overhead 1
        - overhead 2
    - table 2
        - overhead 1
        - overhead 2
- keys for main table and stage set up on a8k PGM1
- optionals keys for table two set up on PGM2
- put 5 drives in the top five hyperdecks and format
- set up a8k and a4k
- art supplies and materials out on rolling tables (as neatly as possible so that it's clear what each table says)
- have google colabs open on the macs at each station
- have green and studio signed in to macs at each station
- confirm each station is connected to stable diffusion with controlnet and working
- create event-processing folder for today's media/stills and sign in to Synology10 on all machines
- 

### basics

- if icebreaker, mainly to give them a sense of what the studio does, what the tools are.
- introduce them to an array of tools (quickly)
    - ai tools
    - media tools
    - art tools
    - moves
        - constraints
        - recursion and ensembles
        - physical and digital media, human and artificial intelligence, analog and digital capture
- have two working stations set up for them
    - tables
    - overheads being captured
    - computers
        - with stable diffusion
        - with playgrounds
        - with colabs
        - with adobe
    - mics for transcriptions
    - cards and markers
    - whiteboards
    - 
- mainly 
    1. help them work and plan on day 1; 
    2. do production on day 2
    3. offer additional worktime or hackathon for each of the 3 groups
- set design
    - print lots of the gaica's work
    - emr images up
- resources
    - list of contacts, names, tools
    - timeline/dates
    - 

### rationales and stories

- the mental model for this one should be making space; and that's the way to report it. So less emphasis on content delivery, more on design studio / Q's studio.
- and the lluf/gaicas going a step ahead to then becomes guides
