## draft
Hi Greg,

Happy new year! We hope you had a restful break. 

Thanks again for the Azure log-in info. We gave it a try and it works for us.

As the new term gets going we thought we'd ask a few follow-up questions:

1. Do you want to start meeting up periodically to check in on our various GAI-related projects? Perhaps starting early next week?
2. Does it still make sense to have a first meeting of GAICAs on Friday, Jan 12th? and if so should we write to all of them together? 
3. If that does make sense (a meeting on Friday the 12th), then maybe we can discuss what we'd like to do at it if and when we meet up next week?
4. Finally, have you heard of any new projects or developments we should be aware of?


All best,
Marlon and Dani

Hi Marlon and Dani,

I hope that the semester is rounding out well for you!
  
Our Azure account is now accessible! See the attached document for access details that colleagues in HUIT have helped put together. 

If we don't talk before then, have a wonderful holiday and new years!

Best,  
Greg
