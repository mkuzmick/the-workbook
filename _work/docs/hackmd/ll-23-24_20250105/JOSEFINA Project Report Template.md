## Preliminary MK/MW Notes

* MW: 
    * Josefina has long-standing interest in the LL. She came as part of the "job interview" workshop through Terry's class as a Freshman. However, she was unable to apply to be a LLUF until this semester, when she quit the track team to focus more on extracirriculars and her academics.
    * She is studying bioengineering, and has particular interest in the application of AI to medical imaging and processing. 
        * As a result, she has lots of experience working with python notebooks. She also took CS50. 
            * she wants to learn more about CV and APIs

## Project Description

### Project/Tool Overview
**Project Name:** Creative Coding in Literature  
**Associated Harvard Course:** COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy
**Collaborators**: gonzalo, jōsh

**Summary:**  
Josefina's project involves the development of an interactive learning environment that supports "COMPLIT 200: Computing Fantasy." The course is experimental, focusing on the intersection of literary theory, history, and computer-assisted creation using generative AI tools for storytelling. Josefina's work, particularly through code blocks similar to Scratch, aims to enable students to engage creatively with the course's objective of crafting an illustrated volume of AI-generated folktales. This aligns with the course's emphasis on the history and theory of generative storytelling, from structuralist theories to practical applications in narrative construction.

**Technology Stack:** Python, OpenAI API, Gemini APIs

### Learning Objectives and Benefits
**Objectives:**  
- To create "single" colab functions with APIs and python, that can be "stacked" to build larger, literature-generating machines
- To contribute to the course's final project of an edited volume of illustrated AI folktales by enabling easy and creative technological integration.

**Benefits:**  
This tool will empower students to creatively apply computational practices to literary creation, enhancing their understanding of narrative theory and the practical use of generative AI in storytelling.

## GAICA mk check-in
**Date:** 20240227

### Meeting Summary

#### Participants:
- **Marlon (MK)**
- **Madeleine (MW)**
- **Josefina**
- **Gonzalo (GAICA)**

#### Date:
- **February 27, 2024**

#### Key Points:
1. **Introduction of Munari's Variations:**
   - Marlon begins the meeting by sharing printouts of Munari's "Little Riding Hood" variations, setting a creative and visual foundation for the discussion.

2. **"Little Riding Hood" Generator Overview:**
   - The main focus of the meeting is the creation of a "Little Riding Hood" generator:
     - **Input:** Color (specifically Pantone colors).
     - **Title Generation:** The title will be dynamically generated to match the input color, e.g., "Little [Color] Riding Hood".
     - **Content Requirements:** The story and images generated should reflect the Munari style, with multimodal outputs considered, including text and imagery.

3. **Technical Specifications and Development Approach:**
   - Marlon specifies the need for the generator to be multimodal and possibly physical, suggesting features like PDF generation and auto-printing.
   - The development approach will be agile, focusing on rapid iterations and responsiveness to change, eschewing traditional waterfall methods.

4. **Action Items and Assignments:**
   - **Madeleine** is tasked with creating a [document](/eMMAqctKQwmxKwaNekfRKw) for the project, which will include:
     - An outline of the project and its scope.
     - Marlon’s detailed specifications and initial needs.
     - Additional ideas and enhancements ("bonuses").
     - Assignments and responsibilities for team members.
   - **Josefina** will implement the generator using OpenAI's tools.
   - **Gonzalo** will develop his version using Gemini.
   - Both Josefina and Gonzalo aim to produce a minimum viable product (MVP) before the upcoming spring break.
