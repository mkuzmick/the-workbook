# Polycam and 3D Scanning

## Why 3D Scanning?

3D scanning in museums significantly aids in preserving objects and expanding accessibility. This technology allows for detailed digital replicas that minimize the need for physical handling, and enhance the ways that visitors can interact with delicate items. Furthermore, 3D scans facilitate broad access to physical collections allowing for wider engagement.


## Using PolyCam for 3D Scanning: A Step-By-Step Guide

### 1. Download & Installation
   - Search for "PolyCam" on your device's app store (Apple store, Google Play, etc.) It is available on both iOS and Android.
   - Download the app and make a (free) account

### 2. Prepare for Scanning
   - Choose a well-lit area to improve the quality of the scan.
   - Ensure the object you're scanning is stationary.
   - In the PolyCam app, press the + in the top right hand corner to create a new scan

### 3. Scanning Process
   - Select the video option and set to "auto"
   - Point your camera at the object you want to scan and press "record."
   - PolyCam will audomatically take stills and you can see them adding up in the bottom right corner of the screen
   - It's best to start from one angle and slowly move around the object, keeping the object within the frame.
   - Try to cover all angles and surfaces for a complete 3D model. The app will automatically capture multiple images from different viewpoints to create the 3D model.
   - When you have captured enough images (probably ~50), press "done"

   - 

### 4. Review & Edit
   - Choose "optimized" and make sure that "object masking" is toggled on
   - Click "upload and process"
   - PolyCam will automatcially process the images into a 3d model!
   - Once the model is completed (it might take a while to process), you can use the in-app tools to crop, adjust, or scale the 3D model.

### 5. Save & Export
   - After finalizing your 3D model, save it within the app.
   - PolyCam allows you to export the model in various formats (like .obj, .stl, .ply), but in the free version, your only option is *.gltf* which is compatible with most 3D printing services or modeling software (Blender, etc.).

*Remember, the quality of your 3D scans will depend significantly on the lighting conditions and the complexity of the object you're scanning. Happy scanning!*
