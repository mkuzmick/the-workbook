# ll-work-best-shots-of-the-day

The goal is to put together a montage of the best shots from the previous day (in the 10 to 100 zone, not just 2, not 1000). We'll need two exports:

1. one with title cards for the day and event and time of day timecode burned in throughout, and
2. one without the timecode but with the titles

You will post these two exports plus the xml from your timeline to the `#ll-video-editing` channel.

## steps

- get the footage on the drive (usually this will be done for you, so just ask a staff member if you are stuck at this stage!)
- create a new Final Cut library on the drive in the `_fcpx` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist). The library should be called ll-day-20240202-mk or whatever the day of the FOOTAGE is and whatever your initials are)
- in the library create an event called `footage` and ingest the footage there--do NOT copy the files, just leave them where they are on import
- create an event called `compounds` and create a compound clip for each source clip that has the same initial timecode, then drag in the timecode generator and confirm that it matches the time-of-day timecode. You will use these compounds for editing rather than the original footage. You can apply any global corrections you'd like here (if audio and light properties are the same throughout the video file)
- create a separate event called `projects` and create your `best-of-20240202-mk-01` project there (specs = 2160x3840 at 24p). Again, substitute in the actual day, your initials, and then add a counter that you can iterate as you develop the edit further
- create a title card for the day and add it at the beginning of the timeline
- take a look at the calendar for ll-plan from that day (ask MW for a print out if needed) and identify the key events we'll have footage of given the locations specified in the footage (if it's all main studio footage, you can just look for footage in the main studio---if it's all-day footage, you may also have events from the classroom and music room there, etc). Create a title card for each of these events so that you can use them to sort your shots
- move through the footage (usually filmstrip view is easiest) and select the best visual shots
- if someone we have the rights to record is presenting at the main table, you can look for a soundbite---visual cues light laughs and smiles might give you a hint that a soundbite is there if you slow down and listen
- be sure to slot the shots in to the events you've specified in the title cards
- if you encounter any material that does NOT match the events, add an additional title card for it (in the right chronological sequence)
- export for apple devices at 2160x3840 with timecode, then again without (go in to the original compound and temporarily disable the timecode)
