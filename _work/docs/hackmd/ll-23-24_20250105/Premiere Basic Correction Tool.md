title: Premiere Basic Correction Tool

# Premiere Basic Correction Tool
In Adobe Premiere Pro, under the window heading, you will find "workshops> effects> lumetri color". There are several tools under lumetri to color correct, but the "basic correction" tab at the top is a great place to start. 

Under "color" you will find white balance, temperature, tint, and saturation. If you start off with the white balance; using the dropper icon to select a section of white in your clip, you will see that the temperature and tint sliders move. 

- The temperature slider will allow you to play around with making the clip selected either cooler or warmer. This imitates the effect daylights (cooler) and tungsten lights (warmer) have on a set, and adjusting this slider in post will allow you to fix the shot if it was under too cool or too warm lighting. The tint slider affects the presence of green and magenta in your clip. This can be bumped up on either side for creative purposes, but going back and forth manually with the temperature slider will help neutralize your video. 
- Saturation will enhance all the colors in the clip you are applying effects to. On the slider, you can decrease or increase the saturation starting off from a midpoint at "100", but if we were looking at the saturation as if it were a colored slider below 100 would be gray and above 100 would be a color (in other programs it is typically red).

Under "light" you will find exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks. 
Exposure is how light or dark the clip will appear- this and all the sliders in this section have a midpoint of 0.0. 
- In production, underexposing will result in a "noisier" image, while overexposing might blow out the highlights and make the color/pixel information of those white areas undefinable in post-production. Adjusting the exposure slider in lumetri color might help recover or enhance that information. 
- Where saturation acts like a color contrast slider, contrast in the light tab acts as a tonal contrast; boosting the lightest and darkest tones in the clip when increased, and leveling the tones when decreased, resulting in a flatter image. 
- Highlights is comparative to "gain" in other programs, as shadows is to "lift". You can manually adjust the highlights and shadows separately or use the contrast which will affect them jointly. 
- The whites and blacks sliders are cousins to the highlights and shadows, but while the latter is more precise, the former is more general and can mess up the color pixels of the entire image if pushed to far in either direction.

To round up the lumetri color basic correction, the slider adjustments that can be made here are really to help neutralize and brighten your video. This is so the color pixel information can be more easily read and manipulated with the more creative tools available in the lumetri color if desired. 

Another thing to note is that an "adjustment layer" can be placed over any video clip, and lumetri effects can be applied that way rather than onto the actual video itself. This might make it easier to delete effects that dont fit your vision or to stack effects if you want to push something like saturation, further than you could with just the limitations of one slider. 
- To add an adjustment layer go to the bottom of the project window, select the "new" tab or the paper with the corner fold icon, and then "adjustment layer". Then you can bring it and adjust the length of it in the timeline after that.
