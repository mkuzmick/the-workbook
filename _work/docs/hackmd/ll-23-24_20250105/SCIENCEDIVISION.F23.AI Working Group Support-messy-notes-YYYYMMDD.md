## messy notes

### TOOLS & UTILITIES

BOARD ONE

- Single-button execution of prepared query on lecture hall input
  e.g. "Synthesize appended info. & extract top-3 questions..."
    - essentially automating this [use-case](https://hackmd.io/hrXrYFOKTkq1_YceXz8gSA?view). 
  
- Automated generation of lecture notes from slides and/or recordings
    - essentially automating this [use-case](https://hackmd.io/QlLdK6AfQweXAzh88iYRug)

- Generation of HW & assessments from lecture materials

- AI-tutor w/ multi-shot preamble

- Grade sheet analytics

- Data Browsing & analytics for instructional labs

---

ADDED DURING MEETING

- Throughput or content-limited impl.
    - this was unclear, but I think it refers to the feasibility and capabilities of AI in these projects depending on either computational throughput limitations or limitations in available educational content/data to work with.
        - this doesn't seem like a rpoject to me, though? Just a consideration. 

- Custom-Content queries
    - eseentially, ultra-refining a bot for specific courses (or using specialized models instead of chatGPT )

### LONGER TERM PROJECTS

BOARD THREE

- Extract course prerequisites from materials on the Canvas website and self-assessment
    - Stubbs sidenote: 
        - he views this as the future of preparing FGLI students for Harvard through self-assessment 
    - Adam signified he wanted to work on this

- Identify students at risk based on Canvas and other metrics

- Evaluate alignment between course content, learning goals, and assessments.
    - Adam signified he wanted to work on this

- Explore optimal "temperature" for learning
