# ll-event-lab-today


## stuff Siriana is interested in

- realistic and easy to do, but awesome
- master basics
    - like put something on the greenscreen
    - turn on the PA
    - make sure cameras are recording
    - focus camera
    - arts and crafts for activities
    - making sure that you know you can move things around
- let's move the space around early in the year at least once with folks
- learning some of the basics
- "most people don't read"
    - trick people into paying attention
    - examples from museum
        - interactive theatre
        - scavenger hunt


### questions

- how do you tackle heavier topics with the mechanics of play?
- ux design: know your users.
- doesn't always have to be presented as a game
- 


## to dos

1. Siriana designs the capstone event
2. Marlon designs the workshop table
3. write up the list of "basics"
4. design the initial taster for Thursday

## taster ideas
- Fake Final Event! What is this-- Academic Performance as a Rock and Roll Show: 200-500 words of academic content as a rock star. 
    - one large scale manipulation to the studio
    - Green screen 
    - PA system
    - Music bed (loops, learning how music/improvisation affects academic improv)
    - Code
- so a number of discrete learning experiences (2-3 minutes each) that build up to the larger scale final capstone event that Siriana will perform at
