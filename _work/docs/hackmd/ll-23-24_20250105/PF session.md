# PF session on Friday
* probably somewhere around 12 - 18 PFs will come to the LL
* interactive components
    * something from MDF introductory training
    * or something related to their diss - visual communication activity + framework
* serial podcast activity
    * what does this form do
    * what are its moves
    * what form from your discipline would be cool
    * 1 scaffolding activity 
    * what are the essential things you need to teach and how can media forms help you do that

## the plan
* unpack serial
    * the parts of this machine
* think about your discipline
    * what form would you use
    * what learning goals would that allow you to meet
    * write down on cards the possible forms
* the moves of that form
    * write down on cards under each form what using this form allows a student to do
    * example: podcast enables student to perform intimate/first-person types of storytelling appropriate for certain content (first-person narratives or interviews about immigration/borders - an example of a course we worked with)
* having identified a few of the moves this form makes, what activity would you have students do to learn it
    * could be an in-class activity
    * or something they do at home
    * or something they turn in
    * think of this in the formative assessment zone - something low-stakes you'd want students to do on the way to a summative/higher-stakes exercise so that you can give them feedback and set them up for success
