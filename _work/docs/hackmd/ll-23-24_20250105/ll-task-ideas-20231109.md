- remove .29m truss piece from the truss in the small studio
    - nudge the whole thing TOWARDS greenscreen
    - we can lose the lower confidence monitor in its current spot
    - TEST the monitor on the floor, if it works, lean it on the ground, with one corner behind the truss, but remove the 90-degree and we should be able to see enough
- after last activity in classroom
    - pack up video equipment 
        - remove overhead from truss
        - pack up tripods and lights, etc.
        - remove everything from the shelves on the truss, all cables from truss, etc
    - try to clear floor if things there have homes elsewhere
    - move 48x30 workbench currently in small studio into classroom
    - remove casters from 48x30 workbench to make it match the other (Ask Casey for tools or ask Casey to do this)
    - move all 7 black shelf boxes into classroom
- remove casters from 96x30 workbench currently in Storage 3 (Ask Casey for tools or ask Casey to do this)

- remove everything from the floor of storage three
    - feel free to fill up all of the bins in the glass studio and to stack these on the already-existing shelves in storage 2, or on the workbenches in the open space if we are sure that Tamara and Laura are gone for the day
