# quick-notes-on-reflections

## Project Overview:

In this final project, students will _______. 

Students have the flexibility to work individually or in groups, but the effort invested in the project should be equivalent to the effort (in time and intellectual rigor) they would typically allocate to an academic essay. In the case of group work, the allocated time should be multiplied by the number of group members to ensure equitable contribution and results.

### Project Components:

**Learning Materials:** [Describe the format the learning materials themselves should take--where they should be submitted, etc].

**Reflective Rationale:** Alongside the learning materials, students must submit a reflective rationale that provides insight into the project's goals and methodologies. This rationale should address the following key points:

- **Intended Audience:** Explain who the intended audience for the learning materials is. Consider the age group (K-12), prior knowledge, and learning needs of the target audience.
- **Learning Objectives:** Clearly outline the educational objectives that the learning materials aim to achieve. What do you want K-12 students to learn or take away from this project?
- **Key Decisions and Elements:** Analyze and unpack some of the critical decisions made during the project's development. Highlight how these decisions align with the intended learning objectives. Discuss any challenges faced and how they were addressed. You may choose to call our attention to interesting choices you made that we might otherwise overlook.
