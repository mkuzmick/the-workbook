![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0606SHF7U4/group-1-art-of-the-mansoon.jpg?pub_secret=b1d211f2f6)

### Introduction

Our group is excited to propose an interactive, web-based project that focuses on the exploration of Angkor Thom, a complex located in Cambodia. This project aims to provide an immersive and educational experience through branching narratives and arguments, allowing users to delve into the rich history and cultural significance of this ancient site.

### Project Overview

The project will begin with a broad perspective, starting with a map of the Indo-Malaya ecozone. From there, we will zoom into a map of Cambodia, and subsequently, into a detailed map of Angkor. While the broader region of Angkor houses numerous temples and historical sites, our project will specifically focus on Angkor Thom.

### Thematic Exploration

Upon reaching Angkor Thom, users will be presented with the option to explore the site through three distinct themes. We are currently in the process of refining these themes, with potential topics including Vishnu imagery, politi##cal themes, and other aspects of cultural and historical significance.

Each theme will be explored within specific monuments or sites within Angkor Thom. For instance, one team member might focus on a theme within a certain monument, while another member might explore a different theme within the same or a different monument.

### Interactive Elements

In cases where there is an overlap, where two themes are relevant to the same site, we will incorporate a split-screen feature. This will allow users to view both themes side by side, each accompanied by a detailed paragraph explaining the significance of the theme in relation to the site.

### Conclusion

Our project aims to provide an engaging and educational platform for users to explore the rich history and cultural significance of Angkor Thom. We believe that the interactive, web-based format of this project will offer a unique and immersive experience, allowing users to delve into the complexities of this ancient site in a way that is both informative and engaging. We welcome any suggestions or feedback to further enhance this project.

### Introduction

Our group proposes an interactive, web-based project that focuses on the exploration of iconography in Indian temples through the lens of the four elements: air, fire, water, and earth. This project aims to provide an immersive and educational experience through a detailed analysis of various motifs and symbols associated with each element.

### Project Overview

The project will dissect the different icons and motifs associated with each of the four elements in specific temples. For instance, when focusing on the element of water, we will examine the Shore Temple and analyze the various water-related symbols present, such as nagas, lotus, macara, and frogs.

### Thematic Exploration

The same approach will be applied to the other three elements. For air, we will explore motifs such as clouds and the multi-roof towering, which symbolizes reaching the sky. For earth, we will examine symbols like elephants and Boudivier.

### Temporal Analysis

In addition to the thematic exploration, we plan to incorporate a temporal analysis. We will examine a timeline to see how these motifs have evolved or remained consistent over time. This will provide insights into the historical and cultural shifts that have influenced the iconography of these temples.

### Correlation with Environmental Factors

Another layer of our project will involve exploring potential correlations between the emphasis on certain elements and environmental factors during different time periods. For example, we might investigate whether water motifs were more prevalent during periods of intense weather cycles.

### Conclusion

Our project aims to provide a unique perspective on the rich iconography of Indian temples by linking it to the four elements and environmental factors. We believe this approach will offer users an engaging and educational platform to explore the cultural and historical significance of these symbols. We welcome any suggestions or feedback to further enhance this project.

### Introduction

Our group proposes a web-based project that delves into the iconography and representations of Budevi, the Earth Goddess, throughout time. This project aims to provide an immersive and educational experience through a detailed analysis of various motifs and symbols associated with Budevi across different locations and periods.

### Project Overview

The project is organized around four primary themes, which are currently a work in progress. These themes will serve as the foundation for our exploration of Budevi's representations. The audience will be able to interact with these themes, highlighting specific artworks on a map and timeline that relate to the chosen theme.

### Thematic Exploration

For instance, if a user is interested in the theme of female autonomy and its intersection with Budevi, they can select this theme. This action will highlight relevant artworks on the map and timeline. Users can then choose which artworks they want to explore in more depth.

### Artwork Exploration

Upon selecting an artwork, a detailed webpage will appear. This page will include an image of the artwork, general information, and specific details about the iconography and how it relates to the applicable themes. Once the user has finished exploring, they can reset the page, bringing all artworks back into view.

### Interactive Elements

We are also considering making some images interactive. For instance, users could click on specific parts of a representation of Budevi, such as her headdress or waist ornament, to receive more detailed information about these elements.

### Conclusion

Our project aims to provide a unique and engaging platform for users to explore the rich iconography of Budevi, the Earth Goddess. By offering interactive elements and thematic exploration, we hope to deepen users' understanding of this significant figure and her representations throughout time. We welcome any suggestions or feedback to further enhance this project.

### Introduction

Our group proposes a web-based project that explores the concept of routes and itinerant objects. This project aims to provide an immersive and educational experience through a detailed analysis of various movable objects that have traveled with people over time, a shift from the traditional focus on stationary artifacts.

### Project Overview

The project will revolve around a specific trade or pilgrimage route, serving as our central theme. Each member of our group will select a different object from various locations along this route. The main page of our project will feature a map with our specific route outlined and tabs for each of our chosen objects.

### Object Exploration

Each object's page will delve into several key themes: iconography, material, location, and time period. To provide a deeper understanding, we will also explore the political relevance, function, and religious significance of each object. A particular focus will be on the function of these objects, investigating whether their use was practical or spiritual, such as for protection.

### Timeline Analysis

In addition to the thematic exploration, we plan to incorporate a timeline for each object. This timeline will trace the journey of the object, marking its origin, any significant locations it traveled to, and its current location, which is likely a museum.

### Conclusion

Our project aims to provide a unique perspective on the journey of movable artifacts, tracing their routes and exploring their significance in various contexts. By offering interactive elements and thematic exploration, we hope to deepen users' understanding of these itinerant objects and their journey through time and space. We welcome any suggestions or feedback to further enhance this project.
