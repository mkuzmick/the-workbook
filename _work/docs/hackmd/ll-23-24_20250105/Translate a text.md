![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F060Y0ZMHTR/translating_text_side_by_side.png?pub_secret=9cde1126b4)

            prompt used: "translating a text, texts side by side. one tech, one arcahic"
      
## description
Students could use an AI tool like chatGPT to produce a translation of a text they're studying in a course, or even to test out whether their own translation of a term or text is accurate. This could enable a student to make an argument about a particular word choice, phrase, etc. and analyze that term's profound implications, once they've gotten some feedback from the AI about the term's meaning.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT
3. For this activity
    * paste in the text in its original language
    * ask chatGPT to help you translate a specific term or phrase in that passage
    * prompt it to explore whether other meanings of that term or passage are possible
4. Another version of this activity:
    * ask chatGPT to translate a passage
    * ask it to translate it in a particular prose style
