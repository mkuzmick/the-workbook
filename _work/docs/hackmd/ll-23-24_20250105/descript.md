## description
* Generic description: 
     * Descript: Descript is an AI-powered editor that automatically transcribes your audio and video recordings so that you can edit them just like text. It also uses AI to remove background noise and improve recording quality with a click (via Studio Sound), detect filler words like “um” and “uh,” and can insert AI voices — even correct misspoken words with a synthesized version of your own voice, if you want — via its Overdub feature.
