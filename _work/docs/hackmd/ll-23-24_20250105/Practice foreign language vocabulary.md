## description

GAI: Students can use an AI tool to practice foreign language vocabulary in a specific context, such as air travel in Spanish. The AI tool can be programmed to generate a series of questions or interactive scenarios that test the student's knowledge of specific vocabulary words or phrases.

For example, the AI might simulate a conversation with a flight attendant, asking the student to respond in Spanish to questions about their seat preference, meal choice, or other aspects of air travel. The AI can provide immediate feedback on the student's responses, correcting any errors and providing explanations for the correct vocabulary or grammar usage.

The AI tool can also adapt to the student's proficiency level. If the student is easily answering the questions, the AI can increase the difficulty, introducing more complex vocabulary or grammar structures. Conversely, if the student is struggling, the AI can simplify the questions or provide additional hints and explanations.

Moreover, the AI tool can provide a safe, low-pressure environment for students to practice their language skills. Students may feel more comfortable making mistakes and learning from them when interacting with an AI, compared to a human conversation partner.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for practicing vocabulary, it is not a substitute for interacting with native speakers or studying the cultural context of the language. Therefore, it should be used as a supplementary tool, in conjunction with other language learning methods.

1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
