## The hurdles to interplanetary life
Simply stated, the Great Filter says that intelligent interstellar lifeforms must first take many critical steps, and at least one of these steps must be highly improbable. Indeed, the premise of the Great Filter is that there’s at least one hurdle that is so high virtually no species can clear it and move on to the next. But while the term the Great Filter suggests the conscious action of some sort of exogenous entity, in reality, the hypothesis is more a way of thinking about the relative likelihood of certain events happening — or not happening — in their own natural course.

So, what basic hurdles must be cleared in order to become a truly advanced, spacefaring civilization? Hanson suggested a few, paraphrased below:

## Example hurdles

- A planet capable of harboring life must form in a star’s habitable zone. Life itself must develop on that planet.
- Those lifeforms must be able to reproduce, using such molecules as DNA and RNA.
- Simple cells (prokaryotes) must evolve into more complex cells (eukaryotes).
- Multicellular organisms must develop.
- Sexual reproduction, which greatly increases genetic diversity, must take hold.
- Complex organisms capable of using tools must evolve.
- Those organisms must create advanced technology needed for space colonization. (This is roughly where humans are today.)
- The spacefaring species must go on to colonize other worlds and star systems, while avoiding destroying itself.

While humans are not yet capable of interstellar travel in any meaningful sense (beyond a few small robotic probes like the Pioneer, Voyager, and New Horizons spacecraft), we are capable of advanced radio astronomy, meaning we’re a relatively tech-savvy civilization. But even if it took the same inordinate amount of time for an alien civilization to make the technological leaps humanity has, given the age of the universe, there should be at least a few interplanetary species colonizing their entire galaxy by now.

But, again, astronomers see no evidence of such civilizations. When they look to the stars, the silence is deafening.
