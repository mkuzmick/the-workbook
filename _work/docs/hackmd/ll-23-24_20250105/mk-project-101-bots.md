# mk-project-101-bots

## basics

- build a bot a day
- the tough part is that all of this will have been needless, because Slack and Teams and X are surely going to release customizable personae this year---now, they will have to charge for this (quite a bit one hopes), but it will happen.
- the argument for doing this (and getting interested fellows to do it) is that this is the only way to fully anticipate what's coming (and why does this matter? well...)
