#  NEURO101RA Poster Making Workshop Student Guide

## Workshop Recap

* We did an activity in which we practiced expressing abstract relationships graphically. We used Duarte's Slideology [diagrams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLK3Gs7WeXLxGP6EoOBp4dQKglfCYIE2/view?usp=sharing) for inspiration.
* We unpacked model posters, discussing both the features that made them effective and the aspects we would change.
* We edited poster drafts from this week's class. We explored how changes like rearranging sections or replacing blocks of text with bullets or diagrams could improve the readability of the posters. 

## Reminders for successful graphics
* How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
* How do the **alignment** and  **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
* How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
* What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
* Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
* Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?
* Have I made my design choices **intentionally** and avoided adding elements that distract from the message I am trying to communicate?
