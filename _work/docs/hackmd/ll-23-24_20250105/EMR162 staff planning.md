# 20240227 EMR162 staff planning
## messy notes
* readings form the week before and that week would be cool to print up
* track down google controversy from the news
* basic idea of them playing around with the code, and then getting a result they can reflect on as cultural/ethical critics. so thinking of a few more 
* we'll want computers set up at a number of stations that have things ready to go
* interacting with the main APIs that the big corps are releasing 
    * stable diffusion is maybe cool as a comparison, but the canonical/central entities are the big corps
* examine the guardrails that corps have put in place, and then critique those
* kb: the neutral is racialized
* easy things to do-
    * main playgrounds (google, amazon bedrock, open AI)
    * colabs are also great
* what makes most sense for the flow - one at a time, in a row, etc.
    * different computers
    * to be able to compare - so finding a way to qucikly harvest their results

students come in with the prompts, and we only print results if they specifically request them

re: trigger warning - maybe choice in stations?

python is the zone for equisite corpse-y 

proposed flow maybe
* get the students to brainstorm the prompts with cards. lots of cards out on the table (flesh them out, augment them, etc.)
* and then go around to different stations for taste of different tools 
    * 3 computers, students in pairs
* and then if they sit and work on something, they can do what madeleine was talking about (?)
    * machine stacked colab?? 
    * students could pair up again
* regroup and reflect

they can do protocol things, not necessarily code-based (ie. take this image from dalle ask put it into chatgpt and ask it X)

final plan:
* have some printed images of Singapore tests
* have Leslie interpret those along the lines of 
    * what was the "ideal" or expected output
    * what is the output/what's it doing
* talk about their prompts
    * what is the ideal output
    * where do you think the AI will fail
    * concise version of the prompt for testing
    * show them the 100-bots channel quickly
* who's excited about text versus image generation
* AI petting zoo
    * Dall-E
    * Gemini Advanced
    * Open AI Playground
    * Midjourney
    * Harvard Sandbox
    * Colab/Python notebooks
* go from computer to computer to show the different tools
    * have students put in prompts
* then break up into small groups and explore across tools
    * low code
    * no code
* print the ones they like
* get those under overhead
* share out at the end
