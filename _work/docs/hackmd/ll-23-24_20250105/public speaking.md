*most important

### more info
* one pager - to explain to OUE and the college maybe, generally how we support public speaking. 
* very much tied in with AC thinking on intellectual vitality. 
* different ways we're teaching the skills of sharing ideas, articulating ideas, listening to ideas (examples in dialogue AND listening)
* practicing articulating ideas in differnt contexts).
* collaborations with EXPOS and [Mindich](https://hackmd.io/aDBjJCrbSoeBCzSO8tkFAg?view) are good (more speaking than visual communication though)
* maybe JL's class

## draft paragraph about LL support
The Bok Center’s Learning Lab is an intergenerational team with a studio space dedicated to fostering creative approaches in teaching and learning. Collaborating closely with faculty, we understand their goals and then design and prototype new assignments, activities, and resources for their courses. Our projects support a range of assignments, from video essays and podcasts to infographics. Central to our methodology is incorporating short oral presentations and pitches as fundamental scaffolding activities in our workshops, crucial even when the final project is not a public speaking assignment.

Our approach to public speaking is unique; it’s not about memorizing lines or facts. Instead, we encourage students to understand their subject deeply, akin to knowing one's hometown so intimately that guiding someone through it becomes second nature. This method allows students to tackle any topic or question with confidence and fluidity, moving away from rote memorization to a more organic and comprehensive understanding.

In our workshops, we employ theatrical games specifically designed to enhance listening skills, crucial for effective communication. Separately, for pitch assignments, we delve into classic storytelling and argument structures, enabling students to construct compelling narratives around their ideas. This dual focus on listening and storytelling enriches the students’ ability to present their thoughts cohesively and persuasively.

The skills developed in public speaking are then applied across various forms of new media. Our holistic approach emphasizes that effective communication, whether through oral presentations or digital media forms, is about conveying ideas with clarity and conviction. Students utilize the skills honed in public speaking to engage with and actualize their coursework across different media, from filming and podcasting to 3D modeling. This comprehensive method not only focuses on the creation of diverse media but also on building a thorough understanding and effective communication skills, foundational for both academic success and real-world applications.




## examples
### Undergraduate Senior Thesis Writers
We continued to build new opportunities for undergraduates to communicate the ideas they have developed while working on their senior theses. For example, we offered  
-   one-on-one consultations for senior thesis writers working on multimodal senior theses. 
-   workshops for History of Art and Architecture students interested in incorporating visual analysis and argument into their theses. 
-   video interviews for Philosophy students that helped them develop their ability to explain complex philosophical ideas to an imagined public audience.
-   a showcase event for Music students where they performed a version of their theses live, inspired by the NPR Tiny Desk series.

### CE 10
Annually, the Learning Lab collaborates with the Creativity and Entrepreneurship (CE 10) course, guiding students in the creation of innovative ventures that aim to make a meaningful impact in the world. A key aspect of our role is to assist students in effectively communicating their ventures, crafting compelling pitches for their products, and conveying the significance of their designed interventions. This year, our workshop's goal is to transform students' business model canvas into a powerful two-minute narrative. This involves an activity focused on practicing and improvising their pitch in various settings.

We observed that students are increasingly gravitating towards diverse media beyond traditional text to express their ideas. This approach resonates strongly with today's audiences, persuading them to invest in their companies, products, and innovative concepts. The workshop activities include transforming their Business Model Canvas into modular card-based set pieces for their pitch, and practicing delivering these pitches in different environments like a small studio, on stage, and an elevator pitch scenario.

A highlight of the workshop is the "pitch playoffs," where students go head-to-head, presenting their pitches in a tournament-style format. This provides them with a unique opportunity to refine their public speaking skills and to understand the impact of their communicative choices. The playoffs, along with discussions on narrative structures and story trajectories, emphasize the importance of constructing a persuasive argument and actively listening to others' ideas, fostering intellectual vitality.

Since the inception of CE 10, the Learning Lab has been instrumental in equipping students with the necessary skills to present their ideas persuasively. Our focus extends beyond fulfilling course requirements to empowering students to use various media forms for making a persuasive case for their innovative ideas, with an emphasis on activities related to constructing an argument and listening to other ideas.
