# mdf meeting 1 20240123

## reminder: mdf application opens feb 1!
* everyone is welcome to apply again
* and you have to apply to be considered for next year's cohort :) 

## intro to spring theme
* we're going to think about documentation from our perspective as educators
    * we are going to explore documentation in all of its richness
    * but we're especially going to think about why we would document students' learning
    * and how and what we might document students doing/making
    * this is especially important in the multimodal assignment space
    * when students are often working in a form that's new to them
    * and they need to learn ways to develop this type of project in a way that sets them up for success
* why document?
    * you need PROOF that students are learning - this what the Bok center is all about
    * this is why the university exists :)
    * you need evidence that you're actually doing something to get funding, to argue to keep your dept open, to justify the existence of a program for students, to justify a new course topic, etc.
* how can you curate this documentation into something meaningful, both for yourself as an instructor and for your students? 
* this is related to metacognition--a consistent reflective practice that is fundamental to the learning process 
    * as instructors we want to engage in this practice constantly, as we assess what students are learning (or struggling with) and how we can engage them and come to new understandings collectively
    * we want our students to undertake metacognition throughout their learning
    * many of you have taken on projects that precisely engage students in this practice
        * anna's time-capsule videos for Russian language learners
        * many of you have worked with courses that have students write artists' statements

## spring labs/working groups
* in the fall, we had labs where you learned in open ended ways skills you’re excited about
* now we’re shifting into teaching you things that are more directly relevant to your projects and ours
* so, with that in mind, we’re shifting to working groups where you’re learning things in a targeted way
* here's my preliminary thinking about these working groups
    * undergrad-facing sci comm / multimodal comms
    * grad-facing multimodal comms
    * ai
    * documentation in the afvs zone

## spring working groups CD is proposing
* undergrad-facing multimodal comms / scicomm
    * explainer video
    * 3D/biorender zone
* multimodal academic communication for grads
    * humanities + social science versions of this (music, slavic, celtic have all asked for this)
    * Harvard Horizons
* AI
* documenting artistic/creative process
    * different from our MDF meetings theme insofar as this is more about capturing creative process, artworks, etc.
    * links to Julia's projects for AFVS senior thesis students

## activity

### jigsaw
* each group will be assigned [a chunk of this reading](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBo0GFXTxHBKG9iqxcOoLNGdqrMT0c1e/view?usp=sharing) that overviews what documentation is and its core principles
    * group 1: pp. 74 - 78
    * group 2: pp. 79 - 82 (stop before "Interpreting")
    * group 3: pp. 82 - 87
    * group 4: pp. 87 - 89 (stop before "Engaging Families")
    * group 5: pp. 91 - 94
* 3 key points on cards
    * bonus points for SINGLE term or ILLUSTRATION! 
* for listeners: try to critically listen as each group presents
    * use a card to illustrate the main point you think that group is making
    * or write down a core term/concept the group overviewed
    * we'll place these under the overhead as we go

### tools for documentation
* list out on cards all of the tools you could imagine using to document
* what do you know now
* what tools do you need to learn
