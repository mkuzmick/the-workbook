        * underline terms within the text that point towards the "move" the authors are trying to express (e.g., "compared to" or "lead to")
        * AND moments when you could imagine animating/transitioning from one idea to another
        * how can you visually develop that narrative 
    * paper prototyping
        * paper frame at each table acts as boundary around the slide
        * students create a visual interpretation of thee data/text in article using craft materials
        * pick ONE THING that could be ANIMATED - brought into the frame at a key moment
        * be ready to tell cue christine and emily so they can do this for you while you're on stage!
