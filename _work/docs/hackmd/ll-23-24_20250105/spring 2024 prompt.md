# spring 2024 prompt

This spring, we're focusing a ton on documentation and curation--documenting learning processes, documenting objects and experiences through our work with courses, and curating in real-time during events and after the fact. We always focus on these things, of course, but this spring we're going to have a special emphasis on them given our work with AI and the HILT grant we recently applied for (which entails teaming up with Louisa from HGSE and rigorously applying the Reggio Emilia approach).

Given the projects we're supporting in the spring, and given what the MDFs need to learn in their remaining time with us, I am issuing a call for instructors who will come to MDF meetings to teach something you've been learning so as to help MDFs and the rest of us learn about its pedagogical potential!


This would involve:
* identifying a form you've been working with to prototype things in January
* teaching that form through the lens of how you'd use that form to document the learning process or to document learning objects
* keeping in mind that the goal of this project is to develop documentation practices that students or the LL could do
* finding a reading or resources that you can share with MDFs and that they can refer to after the meeting

there are many things that can be documented
* the learning process
* the teaching process
* the data that you are researching/learning/teaching
* the making process
* a thing made

and different people/agents/mechanisms can do the documenting:
* students can self-document
* students can document each other (in pairs or groups, etc)
* teachers can document their work
* teachers can document students
* AI agents and other mechanisms can do the documenting

and this can be done at different scales:
* documentation of a single capstone
* documentation/curation of multiple works by multiple students
* documentation of hundreds of small movements towards a final project
* sensor or camera-driven constant-documentation

and then the curation can happen in multiple forms:
* a virtual gallery
* a video essay
* a live event that deploys real-time curation
* etc.!

so, basically, for this project, you'd:
* take what you know already
* and filter it through this point of focus (i.e., documentation and curation or AI or ideally some combo of both)
