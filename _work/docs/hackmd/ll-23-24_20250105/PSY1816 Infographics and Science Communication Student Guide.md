## Workshop Recap
We are excited to work with you on your assignment! Here's a quick recap of what we did during the workshop:
* We listened and participated in a lecture led by students in the course.

* We unpacked a model graphic that was featured in this week's student presentation. We discussed ways in which this graphic could be edited to be more effective. Some questions we posed as important considerations when generating graphics were...
    * How do I use **color** to organize my ideas and show the relationships among the components of my graphic?
    * How do the **alignment** and  **proximity** of the different elements of my graphic communicate ideas?
    * How and why might I want to implement **repetition** within my design to create a sense of unity and consistency?
    * What **fonts** should I use and when should I use them? 
    * Are there places where text can be replaced with **icons** or other helpful graphical representations of the information? 
    * Can elements of my graphic be organized in a **structure** that communicates something about the relationships among the ideas  (e.g., flowcharts, timelines, cycles, etc.)?

* We did an activity in which we "remixed" an academic paper from class.  
    * First, we looked at the text to find key words that might hint at how the concept could be displayed graphically (e.g., expressing the idea of "lead to" graphically might be accomplished with arrows between elements to convey flow).
    * We then prototyped graphical representations of the text using paper and other craft supplies. Several students shared their work and the reasoning behind their design choices.

    * We transitioned to computers to see how different software (Canva, Illustrator, Keynote) could be used to digitally recreate the paper prototypes. We noted the ways in which Canva sometimes encourages less effective design choices and reminded ourselves to be thoughtful and intentional with each element of our design.
