# Pitch Session Notes for GENED1145 Layering Video Essays Workshop 20231006

## slacked pitches

Casey's slacked pitches
* Keyed Multiplane Camera Setup — Set 2-3 overhead cameras in a row, with one keyed on top of the another to allow multiplane annotations, as a way of unpacking the multiplane methods referenced in The Anime Machine, but interfaced horizontally instead of vertically. Students could use the "middle" plane for framing devices and the top layer to comfortably annotate overtop of the video in real time using crayon/chalk/sharpie, so that it cuts through the key clearly. Or, as well, to collaboratively contribute to the annotation process, calling things out as they see them. 
* Match-cut Logging — Use the Media Express-to-Print tool to quickly capture the start and end frames of match cuts, print them and match them side by side under the overhead. Use these static representations to reflect on the compositional elements. 
* After Effects Layering — Use Alpha Mattes and Shape Layers to integrate simple shapes as framing tools directly on top of the source materials.

## messy notes
* adding to what they've done so far, because they're already working on video essays

Layering
* films
* video essay visual elements
* video essay argument

we want to come up with an array of ideas for stations or moments in the workshop that relate to theme of Layers and Layering.
* some could be about creating layers in things they're watching
* when making a video essay, what tools might you use to add visual elements on top of it
* think more about the rhetorical move of Layering and what it allow you to achieve (lowering the technical bar, to really thinking about this. art supply stations etc.)

re: casey's pitches -
* pitch 1- mk loves. fun to create another walk cycle though we might have the previous one
* pitch 3 - zone on after effects - for sure. should the station be on after effects only? or should the station be about learning multiple tools like imovie, premiere, canva, and after effects, so they can choose which they like?
    * the content for this station could be using the films they're watching
* pitch 2 - thinking about match cuts is really cool. getting the word layering there is key. identifying match cuts and then tthinking about visual elements to add to let the audience know it's a match cut, and making arguments about that. 
    * human silhouetting could be part of this


elitza pitch
* liked the scrollytelling workshop from last semester. could apply to a film still. so print many film stills and then they would physically do things to the film stills. using vellum or cutting or erasing, maybe use the green screen as well
    * some film strips here as well
* and then a similar station about how to do it digitally, like masking.

christine's pitch
* soviet cinema course, camera focused on miniature, and then the person stands on stage. 
    * mk said this is more like the film itself station - live interactive way of constructing a multilayered film thing

jk pitch
* first scene gets at physical layers and digital layers in production - maybe the film strip is happening up top, and arguments happening below. so layers of action
* second scene - layers revealed in action as it zooms in
* so getting students to think about working together in a live action zone. so multiplane is distributed across different overhead cameras and how that would get them to think differently (as opposed to just doing this under one overhead)
    * mk said a walk cycle as a character with this would be fun
    * using AI or a script to give us printed stills of a walk cycle

cd pitch
* drag and frame - mini stop motion that is their annotation.
    * mk said if we want to make a stop motion ourselves - we make stop motions and gifs, that would be fun. 
    * we might not want them to do this because we don't want to intimidate them with complex tools etc.


elitza asked about different colored filters or vellums so they think about lighting
* that's cool but let's constrain that experimentation to the cinema station, instead of the paper zone - which is really about visual arugment and how graphical choices can help with that

mk posed the question about using anime overlays

mk said-
* table where it's about marking up the films, we want it to be very in alignment with what alex is excited about, so lots of arrows and things for calling out. 
* creative zone is more about moves of cinema

jk idea-
* little city miniature on the stage (like godzilla!!)
    * mk asked what are they doing in godzilla? for the activity to be rooted in that
    * elitza said they're also covering modern films


elitza mentioned NYtimes anatomy of a scene - has really great videos - she has posted some in #ll-av-lab

mk said still good to think about a final moment where they share their work. elitza said that moment is important.
* jk said overlaying scenes to analyze them 
* elitza said thinking about classic split screen of comparing 2 things together
* everyone exports a 10 second looping gif, so we have a looping gif gallery

mk asked how much we're on the loop for teaching the how to do things, or just giving them a taste of tools
* mk said we've given taster menus of different ways of animating. maybe flow from digital and then eventually get to the green screen where they can manipulate their friends on the green screen
* maybe just give them a map of tools since there really won't be enough time
    * mk said he wouldn't recommend after effects, it's not the most effective.
    * giving them a map of tools


elitza said we should prepare a short example of how we've annotated something ourselves and then break down how we've done it

good for stations to share content or theme.
* elitz said combo of feature film and animated. so they don't only work with black and white japanese films.
* we would prepare materials from various films

13-15 students per section
3 stations-
* visual argument station - physically marking up (definitely have arrows) - graphical overlays to make visual arguments (layering multiple films, arrows, etc.)
* digital tools for overlays - after effects and canva
* overlays in cinema - layering in film itself - VFX, effects in anime, the multiplane thing casey pitched, green screen, so they understand how layering is constructed in film. green screen to create something that's film like
then a few volunteers share - say something about the role that layering plays in cinema and video essays.
* and then we should make buttons+ videos with audio of them speaking about this

## resource to send back
* prepare even just a plan with images (we need to SHOW what the stations involve, so we should do the stations to get footage)

to do
* rip all the films we have access to for this course
* print a bunch of stills
* see if jk and cc want to prototyope the multiplane zone, and do a few tests like with godzilla
* for digital zone - have a resource on the various tools you can use for different types of layering
* and then we can use stills to show alex what's happening at 2 of the stations. and then atleast send a list of tools
