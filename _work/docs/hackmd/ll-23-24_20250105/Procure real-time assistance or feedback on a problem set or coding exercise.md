## description

GAI: Students can utilize an AI tool like CS50's chatbot to procure real-time assistance or feedback on a problem set or coding exercise. This tool can provide immediate, personalized support to students, helping them understand complex coding concepts or troubleshoot issues in their code.

The AI tool can be programmed to understand a wide range of coding languages and concepts, allowing it to provide relevant feedback and suggestions. For example, if a student is struggling with a Python coding exercise, the AI can provide hints or suggest potential solutions based on the specific error messages or issues in the student's code.

In addition to providing assistance, the AI tool can also be used to reinforce learning and promote deeper understanding. For instance, after helping a student solve a problem, the AI can generate additional, similar problems for the student to solve, ensuring that the student has fully grasped the concept.

However, just like any other AI tool, it is important to set boundaries for its use. While it can be a valuable resource for students, over-reliance on the AI tool can hinder the development of problem-solving skills and independent thinking. Therefore, educators may want to establish guidelines for when and how students should use the AI tool, ensuring it is used as a supplementary learning tool rather than a crutch.
