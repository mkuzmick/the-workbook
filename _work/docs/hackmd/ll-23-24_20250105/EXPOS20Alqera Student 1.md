Does musical tempo enhance physical performance, and what are the emotional and motivational uses of music in sports and exercise? I'm using two primary articles to investigate the effects of music on sports performance. The article titled "Music Does More Than Hype Athletes; It Helps Prep the Brain for Action" offers a scientific perspective on how music affects the brain. On the other hand, "The Impact of Music on Performance in Sport" presents a counter-argument, suggesting that music might not always improve athletic performance. I intend to address and rebut this perspective in my writing. Furthermore, the piece "From Jay-Z to Beethoven: How Music Helped Kobe Bryant Cope with Life" serves as evidence, highlighting the significant role music played in the illustrious career of the athlete, Kobe Bryant.

To address your follow-up question about the unique perspective of my research: I'm keen on exploring the widespread practice of athletes listening to music during warm-ups or before games. My research aims to understand the psychological reasons behind this behavior, the motivations driving it, and if it genuinely amplifies athletic performance.
