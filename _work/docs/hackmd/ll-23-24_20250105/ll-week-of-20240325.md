**Creating Your Own Comic (20%)**
For this assignment, you will design and create your own mini-comic related to the course themes. No prior art experience will be required, and your work will not be graded on artistic quality, but on how it engages with the themes and texts we cover during the course. Alongside the mini-comic, you will write a 750 word metacommentary outlining your goals for the comic, how you are engaging with our primary and secondary texts, and the rationale behind your choices. Support for this activity will be provide by the Bok Learning Center which we will visit in-person during the semester.
