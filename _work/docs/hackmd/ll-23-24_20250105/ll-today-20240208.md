## setup

- for AJ: 
    - DD and MW grab notes for MK and MW and walk through the plan quick
    - MW load up all references on presentation machine and run through playing them all with good audio levels and well cut paper to match shot dimensions
    - tech setup
        - screens with ME1 up
        - ME1 keys:
            - key 3 = main-stage flying at 60% or so (to get phone-sized)
            - key 2 = non-flying 100% main stage
            - key 1 = table minus green
        - save xml with today's date and project name and send to #util-save-your-atem
        - have ME set up with computer on program and main table medium shot on preview, with a8k available in ATEM software control on small studio mac
        - a4k on studio nearest the control room door
        - a8k on mac pro
        - top 5 hyperdecks with drives
        - obs open on each
        - route ME1-4 to a8k OBS (probably already there) => 1080p x 4 = 4K 4up (should already be there)
