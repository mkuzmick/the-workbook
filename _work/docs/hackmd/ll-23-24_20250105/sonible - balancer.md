## description
* Generic description: 
    * "Automatic corrections within seconds. Balancer was developed by Focusrite and sonible. While listening to any audio material for a couple of seconds, the plug-in gathers detailed information crucial for the mixing task at hand. By combining and interpreting this information using A.I. technology, deficiencies in the signal (e.g. regarding the spectral balance) are detected and automatically corrected."
