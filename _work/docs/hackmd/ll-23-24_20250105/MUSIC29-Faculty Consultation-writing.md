# MUSIC29-Faculty Consultation-writing

## Writing Task Description and Notes

### Context
Charrise would like template language (Unpack options 2 and 3 from the syllabus - write back some text and send it to charrise).


- Option 2:
Students may work in groups of no more than 5 people, or individually, to produce a video that critically analyzes music and/or an artist not already intensely studied in the course. This video should be 5-10 minutes in length and will be screened in the final class meeting(s). One person must submit the video to the course site for the entire group. The group must subsequently submit a transcript on Canvas.
- Option 3:
Students may work in groups or individually to compose and produce a black protest musical work. The work will be presented in the final class meeting(s). The group must subsequently submit the musical work and a short essay explaining the creative process, relevance to the study of black protest music, including citations, and contributions of each team member. One person must submit for the entire group.
    
### Option 2

Students may choose to work either individually or in groups of up to 5 people to produce a video that critically analyzes music and/or an artist that has not been extensively studied in the course. This video should be 5-10 minutes in length and will be showcased during our final class meeting(s).

One person from each group should submit the video to the course site on behalf of the entire group (though be sure to identify all of the members of the group in the credits for the video). Following the video submission, the group must also submit a transcript of the video on Canvas (which, again, should include the names of all members of the group).

In order to create a compelling and insightful video response, here are some additional guidelines and specific requirements:

- **Analysis and Argument:** Your video should not merely present facts about the music or artist but should delve into a critical analysis. Discuss the cultural context, the artist's influence, the music's impact, and any unique stylistic elements.
- **Research:** Just as you would for a paper, your video should reflect thorough research. Cite your sources appropriately and make sure your arguments are backed by credible information.
- **Visual Elements:** We are not expecting you to produce an HBO-level production, but the visual elements you include should work to enhance and develop your analysis. It should be clear that you have made intentional choices when it comes to editing, graphical elements, etc.


The aim of this project is to apply the analytical skills and musical knowledge you've gained throughout this course in a creative and engaging format. This video project should involve the same level of intellectual rigor, research, and critical thinking as a traditional paper, but offers you more freedom to explore audiovisual forms for expressing your ideas than text alone.


### Option 3

Students may choose to work either individually or in groups to compose and produce a black protest musical work. This work will be presented during our final class meeting(s).

In addition to the musical piece, each group or individual is required to submit a short essay that explains the creative process behind the work. This essay should serve as a rationale that connects your project to the concepts and ideas discussed throughout the course. Here are some specific elements that this essay should address:

- **Creative Process:** Describe the steps you took in creating your musical work. Discuss your inspirations, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. Explain the choices you made in terms of melody, rhythm, lyrics, and other musical elements. If you worked as a group, explain your rationale for dividing the work up the way you did.
- **Relevance to Black Protest Music:** Explain how your work fits into the broader context of black protest music. Discuss the themes, messages, and historical or cultural references you incorporated and why you chose them.
- **Course Concepts:** Connect your work to the ideas and theories we've studied in the course. Explain how your musical piece responds to these concepts. This could include references to specific artists, movements, or songs we've studied, or it could involve broader themes like the role of music in social protest, the evolution of black protest music, etc.

One person from each group should submit both the musical work and the essay on behalf of the entire group (though be sure to identify all of the members of the group in the credits for the musical work and in the essay).

The aim of this project is to apply the musical knowledge and understanding of black protest music you've gained throughout this course in a creative and engaging format. This project should involve the same level of intellectual rigor, research, and critical thinking as a traditional paper, but offers you more freedom to explore musical forms for expressing your ideas than text alone.
