## interactive model + exhibit plan


### people
* staff lead: JK + MK
* activity leads: JK
* participants: 5
### goals
### activites/tests
pinterest and project ideas
5 minutes pinteresting:
1. find a model (or models)
2. note down what that model is "doing" 
    - what is engaging/exciting/cool about it?
    - how is it "interactive"?
    - what are the "parts" of this "machine" that is the interactive model/exhibit, and how are they working to communicate (perhaps more effectively that the traditional paper) to our general audience?
5 minutes discussion unpacking one of the models

tool work time
* blender
* sketchfab
* canva
* physical materials
    * buttons
    * grommet 
    * clay
    * paper-pop-out, folding? try out the animation pop out model?
### schedule

| Time | Action |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| 5:00     |   intros at main table and unpack a model |
| 5:10     |  pinterest step and project idea share |
| 5:20     |  tool work time   | 
| 5:50   |   share out  & wrap up  |
 

 
 

## taster plan


### people
* staff lead:
* activity leads:
* participants:
### goals
### activites/tests
what are the 1-3 things we are doing?
### schedule

| Time | Action |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| 5:00     |  Intro Activity - welcome to the LL & form pitches  interactive exhibits and getting models and seeing whats out there | 
| 5:05     |  Round 1 - pinteresting first   | 
| 5:20    |  Round 2 - before in Ai , start drawing the thing and think about what u want ot be expalingingpaper prototyping and drawing   | 
| 5:35    |  Round 3  - speaking clearly, connecting with the audiencde, rehearsing  |
| 5:50   |  3 volunteers share out  & wrap up  |
 
 
 Option 1:
 
 1. infographics
     - prototype by drawing
 2. video
     - prototype by finding a model and imitating
 3. interactive objects/displays
     - prototype by talking to a friend
 
 Option 2:
 I like this one
 
 1. infographics
     - prototype by drawing
 2. video
     - prototype by rehearsing (try explaining to a partner)
 3. interactive objects/displays
     - start by finding models and picking out the elements and mechanics you could deploy yourself
 
 
 
 
## space and gear prep

### space and gear prep checklist
- [ ] extra notes
- [ ] and a plan/checklist for anyone who is helping to set up (like MPAs or LLUFs)
- [ ] things like creating a media assets folder
- [ ] setting up machines 
    - [ ] in this configuration...
    - [ ] with this software/app loaded
    - [ ] and the assets folder on the desktop
- [ ] prepping paper-based materials
- [ ] what event-lab mechanics are at play

20231103 email to Ogie about the workshops
> The three forms covered in the workshops: 
> 
> -   interactive exhibits/objects (both digital and physical) 
> -   infographics (and related ways of communicating science with graphics) 
> -   short-form video 
> 
> As for the rationales for sci-comm more broadly, or for the choice of these particular mediums for it, it could be that you have ideas just as good as ours.  
>   
>  
> 
> Of course these can and do overlap is some significant ways (for instance, many videos involve infographics or other graphical animations), but this seemed a good way to divide the students up into three clusters that might end up being more or less equivalent in size (and would cover a broad range of the sorts of media that get created in sci-comm projects). 
> 
> For students who do not yet know what they would like to do, we will have a "taster" session on the first night of the week where we will cover each of the three options briefly.  
>   
> As far as learning objectives go: 
> 
> -   these sessions will familiarize students with some of the key ways of communicating science to broader audiences 
> -   weâ€™ll show examples of sci-comm in a given night's medium or form 
> -   while there will not be detailed technical tutorials on specific software options or other tools, we will be giving students an overview of the tools that are used for each of these media, ranging from easy-to-use consumer-level tools on up to industry standard tools of the sort one would use for a Discovery channel show or at a major Museum of Science 
> -   we will be informing the students of how they can reach out to us for support and links to resources as they develop their projects 
> -   students will get hands on experience by producing quick prototypes of a given night's medium or tool in our Studio
