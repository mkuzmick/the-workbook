## llufs
### sd and block printing
- block printing and stable diffusion continue to be needs.
- for SD, we will now settle for 12 or even 8 steps from our overhead, cropped so that the sun is 1/3 the width of the frame, output as square 1024x1024
    - then generate at least 8 things for each of those 8 and save with a naming convention that MW and DD specify
    - then for bonus points create prints from 8

### end of year prep
- [typographic illustrating](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/drawing-vector-graphics-hand-lettering-15566474/creating-hand-drawn-lettering?resume=false&u=2194065)
- llufs with extra time on their hands can start slacking their favorite media or ideas/thoughts of the year in their individual channels to prep for a final on-cam show and tell. 
    - it's fine to just resend slacks to that channel
    - it's fine to resend from img-2-md and other work channels
    - also fine to just type sentences
- there are also a couple of space-related things they could help out with
    - try to use some of the oddest and smallest leftover chunks of the stone fabric to construct a rainbow light above one of the shelves in the classroom (once we approve then we'll line the tops of the walls with this mechanic for the showcase)
        - there's a light you can use for this in the dark corner between the main studio door and the control room door
        - if you want to make another, the matching lights are leaning against the studio wall, and matching cables can be found hanging in the control room (ask MW or DD for help)
