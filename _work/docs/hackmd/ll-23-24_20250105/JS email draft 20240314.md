# JS email draft 20240314
Subject: COMPLIT 200 + Learning Lab check in

Hi Jeffrey,  
  
We hope you’re having a good spring break! We’re just touching base as we get ready for our end of term support for you and your students in COMPLIT 200. As we recall, we mentioned two potential options:
* first of which would be support for the three in-person labs at the end of the term.  
    * We're excited to have the class in for those Monday afternoon workshops between April 1st and April 15th (and we’ve also held the next couple Monday afternoons just incase). We just wanted to touch base about how best to support the students during those sessions.  
* And then the other thing we talked about would be some optional sessions that might be a little bit more technical in nature. We talked about one where students could learn to use Google Colab and another where they could learn to create Slack bots. 
    * That said, as we think about supporting the Monday afternoons, it could be that it makes sense for us just to fold that support into those Monday afternoon meetings.  
  
I'm sure all of this is easiest to discuss over a quick Zoom, but just to kind of get our thinking started, here are some potential things we might do to support you.  
* For the groups you've identified in the syllabus, we could work with the group that specializes on story production to think about the ways in which they could use some of the more advanced elements of the OpenAI APIs in a Google CoLab to work with story production. For instance, Madeleine and our team has worked on constructing an assistant that uses OpenAI's function calling tools to constrain the output to be in alignment with some of the main theoretical models of folktales. You might very well want your folktales to ultimately depart from this, but just as a proof of concept to indicate how we can better control the output of the API. ~~This makes sure that we receive well-structured JSON. I don't know if we'll say this to Jeffrey, but well-structured, I'm just saying, this is what she's actually doing. Well-structured JSON that is completely in alignment with, and then Madeline will insert, I can't remember the exact numbers, but props 31 elements and Campbell's, yeah, exactly. There we go, yeah, exactly. And we can have a link to that ultimately. We're walking through that if we end up finishing it.~~ 
* Likewise, for revisions and editing, this may be something that you want students to do as humans, but it felt to us as a kind of interesting activity might be for them to think about how you would construct an array of bots that occupied the different positions and roles and structural functions that are required in the editing industry or the editing system. One trend in AI development is the development of these kind of bot swarms or ensembles of agents. And the work of academic writing or of writing fiction, there clearly is a vast array of folks that help out from copy editors to senior editors, to brainstorming partners, and we could imagine working with them to construct Slack bots that would play those roles and give them feedback within Slack.  
* For the art projects, we again can help people use the main APIs or the DALLE API or work directly in MidJourney. We have access to all of these in the Learning Lab and they can use our accounts. Here too, it could be interesting to work with some of the more advanced tools that allow you to better constrain and control output, such as ControlNet and Stable Diffusion that would allow you to work from either a pre-existing image to an image that obeys your text prompt. Or even, we had a Ballet class come in recently and we would get students to pose on stage and we were able to get that pose data into Stable Diffusion to generate images that were kind of controlled by that pose.  
  
In any case, probably best for us just to hop on a Zoom and walk through what might be useful. I guess the key thing for us is **wondering whether we should just be here ready to help folks or whether we should start out each session with a kind of tutorial and then have people go their merry way and work together**. Either is fine by us. We could also set up additional work time or let people stay beyond the end of class to work in the space if they just really need time to work with materials.  

One last thing is that we’ve been contacted by The Gazette as they are interested in stories related to our support on AI projects. Please let us know if it would ever be okay with you if they ever dropped by to eavesdrop on one of the sessions - we wanted to make sure we got your permission but it would really be about celebrating your course! Just let us know. 

Really looking forward to hearing from you soon about all of this.

All best,
Marlon? Dani? Marlon and Dani?

Hi Jeffrey,  
  
We hope you’re having a good spring break! We’re just touching base to get ready for our end-of-term support for you and your students in COMPLIT 200. 

As we recall, we talked about having workshops/labs on Monday afternoons in our space, during which students could do any of the following:

- learn skills from our staff (including coding basics to interact with OpenAI, Gemini and other APIs; visual AI tools like Stable Diffusion; the Adobe Creative Suite or other layout tools, etc.)
- prototype using our materials, computers, API keys, printer etc.
- generate final content, again using our cameras, accounts, API keys, etc.

We also discussed the possibility of offering some separate coding tutorials (one in colab, one for building a slack-bot in javascript)--thought this sort of material could easily get folded in to the Monday events too. We did have our staff and undergraduate fellows create some basic "Riding-Hood-Generator" colabs that we could certainly walk the students through if you think there'd be a critical mass of folks interested in this (Madeleine, who you may remember was an undergrad here in the College concentrating in Folklore and Myth before joining us, even created a ChatGPT assistant who is constrained by the structures and elements found in Propp and Campbell!).

It's probably easiest just to connect on Zoom or in person if you'd like to meet up with us sometime next. Just name a time or two that works on your end and let us know if you'd like to Zoom or stop by our studio (50 Church Street) to check things out?

But just to get brainstorming, here are two potential options:

1. we offer 3-4 optional skills-based tutorials in the evenings open to all students, starting even in advance of your lab times (perhaps one on stable diffusion, one on using python notebooks, one on building a slackbot in javascript); then students are largely working in their groups during the lab times with our support
2. we begin each lab-work period with a short hands-on tutorial, then send the groups off to work together
3. we make lab-day-one a "taster" where we introduce them to a few of the technical things we can support them on, then the last two sessions are largely production time.

I'm sure there are other options too! Again, probably easiest to discuss by Zoom or in person, so just let us know if you'd like to connect next week!

best,
Marlon, Dani and Madeleine
