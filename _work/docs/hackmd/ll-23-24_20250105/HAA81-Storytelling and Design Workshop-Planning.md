# HAA81-Storytelling and Design Workshop-Planning

## Planning Task Description and Notes

### Context
Planning for next week's workshop

### Deliverables
[a finalized workshop plan for next week!](https://hackmd.io/Yc4CuzG1Q8y8mBg6GRtNUA)

## messy notes
the students have been broken up into their teams, and have picked out their team animal. today they're learning how to use the site, and one of the goals for this workshop is planning out what they want their site to look like

Tori would like someone to introduce the space
then the students will use the cards, and then present and pitch their projects and get instantaneous feedback

themes
* iconography
* timelines
* maps
* etc.

the story of the object, the story of the site,


* break up in to their groups and write down the questions that they're going to pursue. they will be prepared for that, and to come with questions. (~15 minutes)
* all 4 groups present (15-20 minutes) - really just questions, not content. that will give them the guidiing structure to go forward

JK asked if doing the 2x2 matrix would help structure/give them a terrain for mapping their questions

MK said think about scalar. if paper prototyping is meant to be faster than scalar, think about what they should be doing on scalar, think about how to get them more quickly move through what they want to be doing on scalar. like a map, timeline, and 2 thematic things.

mk said we could print images, and 5 to 7 terms in advance. they could quickly try to re-arrange and brainstorm how that would end up on scalar. practicing doing this before you sink a ton of time typing into scalar.
* tori said she'll come up with the images 
* mk said they can also, use the computers and print themselves

mk asked if tori's heard this year's questions or themes a little bit
* tori said whisperings. one group wants to work on river goddesses

ideally the designing part of their logos is part of this workshop

mk sent [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=y20E3qBmHpg)
* Paper Prototyping of Scalar - images, text, timelines, etc. and uses interact with them in differnet orders. they can show its not linear.
* images, maps of south asia, things that represent timelines or represent times. we can think about physical ways of representing links between these things

> HI Tori,

> This sounds great! It will be an excellent way to engage students and build a sense of academic community that I’m trying to cultivate in the classroom. It does sound like a lot to do so may be have a plan b, i.e. if they don’t finish making their design, what’s the plan (have a few of them, i.e. a representative from each team come back? You will work with each group to finish up)?

They will use the LL’s amazing small notecards to write down key questions, themes, thought nodes, etc. that they want to develop and connect in their final project. With the easily movable notecards they can start to visualize how these aspects of their project connect and how they can use craft their Scalar page to make these connections more interactive and substantiated. They will present their proposed questions and paths of connection using the multicams. More on this later.

> Part 2) The second aspect will be designing or beginning to design their group block print. Ideally this will be an important motif that is loaded with meaning connected to monsoon, water, the environment, and/or Southern Asia.  I would like for them to be able to present both at the end of the section using the large table and camera

> Conclusion: The second half of the section will be presenting . I want them to present both the final project plan via notecards and their team logo using the multicams. Using these cameras, they can organize their cards on the table, but we will be able to  have the card images/text broadcast up on the screens.  This way the whole section can be involved in giving each other real time feed back and to see how other groups are grappling with their projects. I think this will help the groups to cultivate final projects that have more depth,  cohesion, and critical thinking than would be possible  if they were to try to create the final project without the Bok Center.  For their logo,  I want them to end their presentations describing their chosen design by unpacking its meaning and why they selected it.

To help them, I can bring a complete / let us pray accurately made woodblock print to give the students some contours ideas for what they can come up with. If you don’t think this will be helpful and just gobble up time I can nix it.
