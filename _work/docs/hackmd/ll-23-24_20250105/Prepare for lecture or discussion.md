## description
ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for students to establish foundational knowledge and conceptual groundwork before attending in-person lectures or discussion sections. By asking for help and guidance from an AI, students can receive specific information and explanations about the topic they are studying.

One rationale for using chatGPT is that it allows students to ask a wide range of questions that can deepen their understanding of the course material. They can inquire about foundational concepts, explore different perspectives, and seek clarification on complex topics. This helps students engage in active learning and develop a solid understanding of the subject matter.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify that you'd like to use GPT 4.
    *  We recommend selecting GPT-4 32K for the best results, especially with long prompts

3. Hit Shift + Enter to type questions below the quoted text.
    * If you only hit Enter or Return, this will automatically submit your prompt. 
    * You can also add three ticks (''') to indicate a paragraph break if you prefer.
4. Describe the upcoming lecture topic and paste in some excerpts of any readings or a summary of your understanding of this topic. Ask chatGPT to provide you with a summary that includes:
    * a paragraph about one of the key concepts that this lecture will cover
    * three questions about the topic (or the readings) that you might ask in class
        * NOTE: This is an example of where expertise in a given field/area dictates the quality of the eventual AI creation. The more detail you can provide your chosen LLM, the better the result.

5. Wait for the interface to give you a response.
    * This may take a moment. 
    * You may then copy and paste the response for your own use or reference.

## transcript of activity example:

* USER:
    * I am attending a lecture in as part of a series titled "The Intersection of Impressionism and Advanced Mathematical Concepts in Art." I will give you the lectures description. In return, I would like two things. 

        1. a paragraph about one of the key concepts that this lecture will cover
        2. three questions about the topic that I may ask after the talk. 

        The lecture description is as follows: “The Hilbert Space and Functional Analysis: The discussion delved deeper into the mathematical realm by introducing the Hilbert space, as developed by Minkowski and Hilbert. This concept, central to functional analysis, explores the idea of infinite-dimensional spaces. The presenter drew connections between this abstract mathematical realm and how Impressionist artists like Monet represented water—with its complex reflections and muted tones—on canvas.”
        
* AI: 
    * One of the key concepts that this lecture will cover is the Hilbert space, a concept central to functional analysis. Developed by Minkowski and Hilbert, the Hilbert space explores the idea of infinite-dimensional spaces. This abstract mathematical concept is used to describe quantum states in quantum mechanics, but in the context of this lecture, it's being used to understand and analyze the techniques used by Impressionist artists. For instance, artists like Monet represented water with its complex reflections and muted tones on canvas, which can be seen as an attempt to depict an infinite-dimensional space, similar to the Hilbert space.

    * Here are three questions you could ask after the talk:
        * How does the concept of Hilbert space help in understanding the techniques used by Impressionist artists, specifically in their representation of complex reflections in water?
        * Can the idea of infinite-dimensional spaces, as explored in the Hilbert space, be applied to other art movements or is it unique to Impressionism?
        * How did the development of the Hilbert space by Minkowski and Hilbert influence the way we analyze and interpret art today?
