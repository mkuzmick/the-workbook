# OUE resources planning

3 things we want to make for these workshops
accomplishing conventional things in new ways


we want enough things in each of these categories
we want to put a lot of emphasis on things for new instructors
not so much on new ways of doing new things



what sorts of departments these things would be relevant for? department categories (maybe the divions, or qual vs. quant, writing centric or pset centric, etc.)

if we were to start tagging these with something close to departmental relevance? what would be useful for adam as he's prepping with these things?

nice to contact to adam today

nice to draft 


chatgpt initial ideas are less frequently we want to use. we're more likely to want to use chatgpt revisions of our own initial ideas.



we want to look at the scope and find ways of seeing what we're missing

generate the actual content for 3 of them as a sample, and get feedback from tb+lm. what we think would be useful 

## 20231006
different versions of the content
* ab wants to lead people through an activity. so what it would look like to lead people through the activity (doing something?)
    * purely dictionary definition is not useful
    * could try - 
        * You can use this in ______. For instance, and then include screenshots of an example.
        * hero image
        * description of what this is
        * student activity + a walk through with screen captures with chatgpt of what it might look like for a student to do it
        * links for more ideas or related ideas

most important to get done now
* title (from adam)
* description
* sample activity
    * here's what this might look like in practice, and you can follow along with the walk through with screenshots

highly optional, get feedback from tb and ab about what they'd like:
* midjourney hero image
* prompt for students 
* instructor tips ("how to")
* more info on this use case (links)
* related use cases (hackmd links)
* tags (for their use or our use)


update the [LL working version of ab's doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJeB134H42nHeUx9YVx-sCectdX4P9EY1gilPkS938Y/edit)

## 20231016 with AB
* ab is putting together a slide deck that he is going to finish today 
* at key points, he wants to exit out of the slide deck and do a highly participatory, let's all do this demo together (which is what cd has been working on)
* if worried about a demo not working, and if we want to leave people with a screen cast video, even with no sound, that could be a useful thing to have too. because then that could be left in the slide deck like it was the live demo
    * mk asked if we're leaving them with a slide deck
    * ab said we can do whatever - can definitely leave with slide deck.
* ab will poll them 
### about the work
* ab said these hackMDs could be linked in the slide deck
* mk said they could be included in the google folder
* mk asked what are the things ab most wants to have so we can prioritize 
    * ab likes the idea of a playlist for departments 
* timeline is ASAP
* mk said fellows with domain specific knowledge could be helpful in developing these things
### concretely
* for histlit tomorrow - wants them to have it read and process a reading for them
    * summarize or ask questions of a reading
    * deepen understanding of a concept
* ab said it's not our job to leave them with "here's the answer". but showing them what students can do, and then helping to facilitate a discussion about what they might want to do, what they want to be asking students to do, when, etc.
* cd asked about providing description and warning, ?! etc.
    * ab said this structure of the workshop is what we inherited from a and he tried to make it make sense in terms of his categories. 
    * mk said workshops have to get people thinking. just opening up a conversation that has to continue
    * ab said would it be irresponsible to cut the new ways to do old things all together. why are we showing them that?
        * mk said encouraging them to have the lived experience of doing that so they can have a more textured response. just 'students can do this now' erases a lot of the complexity.
        * ab said if they tried it, they'd see it takes a fair bit of learning and skill to write the paper is good enough for your standards. at that point, students have learned a lot of what you want them to learn
    * mk - maybe its just things students might do with this, and things students might do with this
    * ab said what is the point of showing them things we know and they know, that they don't want students to do
        * mk said his sense is that a lot of them haven't played around with it. think about with the course you have now, how might students use AI. and then next time you develop the course, or if you want to develop things on the fly, what things might you want to do
        * cd said trying to find neat pairing between the new way of doing an old thing, and a richer version of it as the new way of doing a new thing
        * ab said the distinction is between completing work (without being oriented to learning) and learning something. we want to get people out of the mindset that this can just help you complete a task
