## Basic Protocol for Pod Time at the Show & Tell Station:

Pod time = 2 hours

### Step 1. Gather any materials or products
Presumably, you have been keeping track of what you've worked on and have been doing that visual documentation of your work thing.   

This should hopefully be a fairly quick and easy task-you don't need to complete any additonal work-just bring what you've done since last pod time!

### Step 2. Find a recording location 
Options include:
- the main table in the studio
-  the corner of the studio
-   the small studio
-   the classroom
-   more to come!
  
Use your own good sense and the advice of the welcome desk to determine the best spot to set up based on what we have going on in that space at a given time. Additionally, here are some general guidelines to help if you need them:
- if the main studio is totally empty, you can set up at the main table
- if the main studio has people working at the main table but it;s not a closed door meeting, you can set up at the music studio corner.
- if the small studio is free and the main studio has an event occurring, but the door is open, you can quietly head in there and set up.
- if the main studio is closed try the classroom

Make sure to check and ensure that recording is actually good to go. Hopefully at least one of you will have learned how to do this in person with Marlon, Jordan, etc.But ust in case, here's a reference we can collectively write up as the first LLUFs learn from us:
#### For Main Studio:
lluf writing space here for documenting the instructions you learned from mk/jk
#### For Small Studio:
lluf writing space here for documenting the instructions you learned from mk/jk
#### For Classroom:
lluf writing space here for documenting the instructions you learned from mk/jk
#### For X...:
lluf writing space here for documenting the instructions you learned from mk/jk

### step 3. conduct your pod time 

## A suggested "syllabus" to structure your pod times

### week 1
Introductions.
take the adobe creative personality quiz and have a brief discussion on 
- what might each of your types bring to your pod collab?
- how does your type relate to they ways you best learn?


ISO interviews:
- name, year, academic concentration
- what does being a lluf mean to you?
- what are you hoping to do as a lluf/what skills are you excited about 
- what is your creative type?
- how do you learn best? 


Portraits.
**basic challenge**: make sure at some point each of you look at the camera and give us some footage that we can pull a still from so we have updated portraits of you! If you have a pod mate that has camera skills, they can help get a good close up and medium close up, framed properly and perfectly focused. You can also grab someone on the LL staff to help if you need it!
**bonus challenge**: as a pod, choose some visual element or elements (tulle, hammers, a part of the truss, etc.) and take pod "LL themed" portraits incorporating that visual element. You can take these with your phone to try to practice creating consistent and properly framed portraits. Consider the composition, angle, lighting, etc. and make sure you could put all of your individual portraits next to each other and they would look like a set. bonus points for taking a group "pod family portrait" in addition!

### weeks 2 on--
**Informal Check Ins**
Take a few minutes to check in with each other. What were the various jobs you did over the last week? Did you learn anything new? 
**Pitch some creative pod interview/update/report options to 
**Iso Interviews**
Each of you take turns to complete your LL Confessional weekly report!

Questions to frame your weekly report:
* what did you do? what's up next?
* did you pick up any new skills this last week?
* did you help with any cool events this week? 
* any shout outs you want to give to other llufs or mdfs?
