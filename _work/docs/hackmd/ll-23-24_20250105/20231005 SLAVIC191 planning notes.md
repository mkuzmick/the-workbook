# 20231005 SLAVIC191 planning notes

[consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gry_ZhqlrCuokH4X5nHx49BSc24Pj9N8i23laZafl8/edit#heading=h.v7gepdfp9t4e)
## messy notes

rip all films
print theoretical readings
print film strips

4ish stations

mk would love to create a silent film at the end

find a few things that happen in those films that we can get them to reproduce with our cameras and equipment. and then we can also be getting footage of them to make a silent film. maybe something on audio and statistical analysis (printing frame by frame and cutting, and then those turn into data vis bar graphs)
