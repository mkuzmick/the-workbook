In this workshop for GENED 1145: Global Japanese Cinema, students had the opportunity to engage with film analysis reflecting on various filmic elements such as mise-en-scene, cinematography, composition, and framing. The workshop was structured around the central theme of layering, revealing the various layers of a film, and animation. The goal was two-fold: first, to familiarize students with the elements that comprise a film’s style and visual storytelling; second, to inspire deeper reflection on how these elements can be incorporated into students’ video essays. In discussing these filmic and conceptual techniques, students explored how filmic elements combined elicit coherent and affective viewing experiences. Additionally, the workshop highlighted the relationship between narrative structure and formal qualities of the cinematic medium.
