## description
* Generic description: 
    * Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by a San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.
* User notes:

## prompting tips

* You’ll often find the results tend towards producing white men even though that wasn’t part of your prompt. You will often have to be explicit about race and gender etc.
* Conversely, when asking for objects or abstract ideas, women are frequently featured
* Though, again, they are mostly white
* Some banned words can limit your prompts: 
    * [Updated list](https://www.greataiprompts.com/imageprompt/list-of-banned-words-in-midjourney/) 
* Keep it simple: Use clear and concise language to describe what you want the AI to create.
* Be specific: The more specific you are in your prompt, the more likely the AI will be able to generate the type of image you have in mind.
* Use adjectives: Adjectives can help the AI understand the mood or style of the image you want it to create.
* Include details: The more details you include in your prompt, the more accurately the AI will be able to generate the image you have in mind.
* Use examples: Providing examples of the type of image you want the AI to create can help it understand your vision.
* Use reference images: Including reference images can help the AI understand the style and subject matter you want it to depict.
* Avoid ambiguous language: Ambiguous language can lead to confusion and may result in the AI generating an image that doesn’t match your vision.
* Use positive language: Using positive language can help the AI understand the desired outcome and may lead to more successful results.
* Avoid using conflicting terms: Using conflicting terms in your prompt can lead to confusion and may result in the AI generating an image that doesn’t match your vision.
* Test and revise: Don’t be afraid to experiment with different prompts and revise as needed to get the results you want.

## pedagogical use-case 

The pedagogical use-case for Midjourney in higher education lies in its ability to stimulate creative thinking and imagination among students. By using Midjourney, students can explore the intersection of AI and artistic expression, fostering a deeper understanding of the possibilities and limitations of AI-generated art. Here are some pedagogical use-cases for Midjourney in higher education:

* Visualizing Textual Descriptions: In literature or creative writing classes, Midjourney can be used to visualize and bring to life descriptions of scenes, characters, or settings from literary works. Students can generate AI-generated artwork based on text prompts, allowing them to explore alternative interpretations and engage with the text in a visual manner.

* Exploring Artistic Styles: Midjourney provides an opportunity for students in art and design courses to experiment with merging traditional art styles with futuristic elements. They can generate AI artwork inspired by classic techniques and reimagine them with a contemporary twist. This exercise encourages students to think critically about artistic styles and encourages creative exploration.

* Concept Development and Rapid Prototyping: Midjourney can be used in design-related courses to facilitate rapid prototyping and concept development. Students can generate AI-generated artwork based on design briefs or project requirements, allowing them to quickly visualize and iterate on their ideas before committing to physical prototypes or final designs.

* Collaboration and Feedback: Midjourney's AI-generated artwork can serve as a starting point for collaborative projects among students. They can share and discuss the generated images, providing constructive feedback and sparking conversations around artistic choices, interpretation, and aesthetics. This collaborative process enhances communication and critical thinking skills.

* Ethical Discussions: Midjourney's use in higher education can also prompt discussions around the ethical implications of AI-generated art. Students can explore topics such as authorship, copyright, and the role of AI in creative industries. This fosters critical reflection on the societal impact of AI and encourages students to consider the ethical dimensions of their own creative practices.
