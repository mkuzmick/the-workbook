            prompt used: "Generate an argument or outline in a paper on a laptop"
   

## description
Students can use an AI tool to generate a preliminary argument or outline for documents they typically write in courses (e.g., essay, lab report). Much like generating ideas for essay topics, this type of activity could be done in the earliest stages of drafting, as students are trying to develop ideas about the structure of the paper and possible avenues for research and analysis.

Depending on the course goals, this type of engagement with AI might give students too much content or information. You might want to set guidelines for appropriate or inappropriate use.

## Transcript of activity example:

* USER:
    * I would like to write on how online fanfiction, especially those that have been transformed into published works or have won critical acclaim both mirror and differ from previous work of "fanfiction" within the canon-- particularly Dante's Inferno and Milton's Paradise Lost. Can you provide me with three essay topic ideas?
* AI: 
    * Absolutely, this sounds like a fascinating topic! Here are three essay ideas:
        * "From Dante to Fanfiction: A Comparative Analysis of Inferno and Modern Fanfiction" - This essay could explore how Dante's Inferno, often considered a form of fanfiction of the Bible, compares and contrasts with modern online fanfiction. You could discuss how both use existing characters and narratives to create new stories, but while Dante's work is deeply rooted in religious and philosophical discourse, modern fanfiction often focuses on character development and relationship dynamics.
        * "Paradise Lost and Found: The Evolution of Fanfiction from Milton to Fifty Shades" - This topic could delve into how fanfiction has evolved from the epic poetry of Paradise Lost to the erotic romance of Fifty Shades of Grey, a novel that began as Twilight fanfiction. You could explore how both works reinterpret and reimagine their source material, but differ in their literary techniques, themes, and reception.
        * "The Impact of Fanfiction on Literature: A Case Study of Dante's Inferno, Milton's Paradise Lost, and Online Fanfiction" - This essay could examine how fanfiction, both historical and modern, has influenced literature. You could discuss how Dante and Milton's works have shaped literary canon, and how online fanfiction is changing the landscape of contemporary literature, both in terms of content and the democratization of publishing.
* USER:
    * Your third option, ""The Impact of Fanfiction on Literature: A Case Study of Dante's Inferno, Milton's Paradise Lost, and Online Fanfiction" is closest to what I was hoping to focus on. Could you provide me with an outline for an argumentative essay about that topic?
