    * Express
* figure out what to show in InDesign
* make copies of argument structures from slideology

## Principles of Good Design (visual strategies)
* contrast
* repetition
* alignment
* proximity
* color coding

## Flourish
- for easily designing data visualizations


What are we trying to do?
- condense
- highlight
- organize

These goals can be achieved through the manipulation of a) color b) space c) contrast d) proximity—can anyone think of anything else?
- Demonstrate the 'card game'
- Have them paper prototype their posters


## cd notes
Structure of workshop:
-unpack a model
-graphic design principles
-paper prototyping (copies of the articles, arts supplies, copies of slideology data structures)
-digital tools overview

Science-style poster presentations
Examples from the past
Science style posters models - find these

-layout - not about obeying a form, it’s more about structuring their ideas visually - what is your structure (are you looking at four cases through two theories, do you have methods and then data)
-what is the structure of your project and how do you visually relate that to people?
-how layout choices reinforce that or make that more visible
-this is what makes it valuable: you want to consider what theoretical model you have
-how to chunk your data

With cards:
-big chunks of what you think your paper are
-how you would arrange them
-weird choices you had to make/what will your challenges be as you lay that out

-if you have big sheet of paper
How would you divide that up and fit that stuff

Graphic design principles - these convey information to your audience

EH notes:

Axiom: laout is a way of structuring ideas. Given this, we want students to be asking:

What *is* the structure of my project? And what are visual strategies for representing that structure?
