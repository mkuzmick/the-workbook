Thank you for sharing that detailed presentation. It's clear that the process you described is a thoughtful and meticulous one, aimed at understanding and mastering the tools at hand before embarking on a larger project. The concept of conducting a study, or a prototype, is a valuable one, allowing for a low-stakes exploration of the tools and techniques available.

In this case, the tools are markers, and the technique is drawing. The process begins with making a line with every marker, not a straight line, but a squiggly one to understand the different effects that can be achieved by varying the pressure applied. This helps to understand the range of thickness and thinness that each marker can produce.

Once the range of each marker is understood, a selection is made, in this case, a big Sharpie and a little silver Sharpie. The choice is intentional, aimed at creating a grammar or rhetoric of moves that can be used to communicate effectively.

The key here is contrast. Just as in graphic design, where different fonts and sizes are used to create a hierarchy of information, the same principle is applied here using markers. The big Sharpie, being chunkier, is used for the main points or headings (akin to H1 in web design), while the thinner, silver Sharpie is used for additional content or paragraph level information.

This methodical approach of exploring the entire terrain of the medium before assigning functional roles to the tools is a great way to ensure effective communication. The contrast in color and size of the markers indicates different communicative roles, providing a clear conceptual hierarchy.

Thank you for sharing this insightful approach to project planning and execution. It's a great reminder of the importance of preparation and understanding our tools before diving into a project.
