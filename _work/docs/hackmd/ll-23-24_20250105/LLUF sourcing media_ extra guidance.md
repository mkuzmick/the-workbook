# LLUF sourcing media: extra guidance

## 1. **Finding Media**
### Platforms to Search for Video Essays
- YouTube (Primary)
- Official websites or channels of news organizations (e.g., Vox, Vice, NPR)
- Data journalism websites for interactive maps and graphs (NYTimes, etc.)
- TikTok for short, informative data-focused videos.
- You can also include other examples of digital media outputs like podcasts, short documentaries, or data journalism pieces (maps, graphs) alongside video essays.

## 2. **Assessing Video Essays**
### Relevance to Course Objectives
- Illustration of courses main topics

### Aesthetics and LL Mechanics 
- Focus on the creative and intellectual quality, as well as the ability to translate historical research into a digital format. A great example of this is our favorite [chair video](). 
- Ensure the examples are accessible and feasible for students to emulate in terms of technical proficiency.
- the best videos will also include visual mechanics that we can highlight or replicate within the LL studio environment during a workshop or during student video creation 
    - less 3D graphics, more focusing on layering, "handwritten" texts and animations

## 3. **Linking Videos in this HackMD Document**
### Organize by Topic
- Create sections in this HackMD, in the following section, in two ways: 
    - The primary sectioning should be by type of digital media format
    - Then organize within those media formats by the various course themes.

### Embedding Links
- Use Markdown syntax: `![Video Title](YouTube Link)`.
- Add descriptions for each video's relevance and content.

### Accessibility
- Ensure videos have captions or transcripts.
