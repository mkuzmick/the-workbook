### notes from the instructor
Post spring break, they’ll have watched 2-3 films. CM will send us the film clips. Showing them the potentialities for their final film, they can think more broadly about the technology, the support, etc. what we’ve been doing the past is great, whatever we want to explore with them sounds great.
