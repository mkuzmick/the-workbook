#### email from robin after consultation
Thank you so much for a very helpful meeting today! I’m really excited to bring the class next week. I cleaned up the documents describing each activity and they are still in the google drive:

It would be great to print out the instructions for each group, the paragraph the students need to re-write, the list of important discoveries + guiding questions to answer, and the figures the students will draw. I will make sure to come early on Tuesday to help get everything set up.

I also made a folder in the “name audio” google drive that has “clean copy” of each student’s audio. I think we can just put these on each of the computers for the sound editing station. I expect a few more submissions so I will update this on Friday.
