# video editing resource for EXPOS20SAHA Animals and Politics 

## Background
### Project description
The LL is collaborating with Sparsha Saha's EXPOS20: Animals and Politics course, in part by supporting MDF Ed's workshop series for the course and in part by supporting student projects. Workshop 5 (on October 13) will be on video editing and we'd like to create a video editing resource for students to use.
### Ask
**A video editing resource!**

For reference, we surveyed the students on their familiarity with video editing. You can view their responses below:
* [airtable interface view responses](https://airtable.com/appUX763hErB9OMKT/pagmCGOE4gGH6qlDX)
* [airtable grid view responses](https://airtable.com/shr3iSm1hFMks1A7o/tblx2zJj89EHe5Wxc)

## Deliverable
A video editing resource. HackMD should work fine for this.

## Timeline
The latest we'd need this done would be by October 13. But if it's done earlier, we can send to Sparsha and Ed for feedback.
