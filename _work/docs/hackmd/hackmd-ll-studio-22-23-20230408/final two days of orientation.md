# final two days of orientation

* 1: scaffolding
* 2: activity design
* 3: grading and responding
* 4: curating & celebrating
* 5: designLab


### today in the studio:
* get all computers able to see the full screen
* make sure they have full stack of developer tools
    * clone repo and open it on all the computers

### for tomorrow
* 1: scaffolding
* 2: activity design

**learning objectives**:
* encounter idea of scaffolding
* have a step that comes out of group work from last week (so reassemble those groups)
* come up with a couple of ideas for scaffolding assignments
    * and then the design of a specific activity you'd host in this space
* learn how to host activities in the LL studio

return to the HackMDs that they made/re-assemble their groups so they're building on what they started last week
overview the mitra scaffolding activities doc (make sure this is in the resources folder)
Sometimes in support of courses we share this list of things
Photo compare/contrast prompt that's written up
You're about to make something that's a scaffolding activity so here are some examples
Here's what it would look like as a list, here's what it looks like as a longer prompt

prompt:
think of your assignment
think of your scaffolding activities
think of something your students can do that would be oral or paper prototyping (that's not separate from what they need to do in the course!)

we'll do a few of the "greatest hits" to model for them: 
* cards on the table for graphic design
* improvise on logic loops (tension/resolution expos)
* some kind of timeline activity?
* single figure or single pair of visuals
list of scaffolding activities for assignment you're working on right now (pt 1)
* share what they came up with so far?
deep-dive: now think about something you'd specifically do in this space (pt 2)
* run their activity?

designLab doc from mitra course
MK will do a couple of the activities + maybe show the canva he made to start the day (need to decide if mdfs have to make this too)
mk will demo the compare/contrast thing (5 mins); give mdfs the chance to do it; then they go into their groups

Sept. 2 meeting:
* manifesto activity and getting into groups (with the LLUFs!)
* mdfs pitch to the LLUFs to try and get them to join their working groups


### for thursday
* 3: grading and responding
* 4: curating & celebrating

bring up g-cal and encourage them to book space for workshops and so forth asap

get the handouts ready
