## Canva Tutorial
1) Create a new project in Canva and select Presentation (16:9).

2) Now you've got your blank presentation. To add some graphic elements, either check out the "Templates" section to use some of Canva's pre-made designs or look in the "Elements" section (seen in the screenshot below). 
Ideally, include some graphics and a title for your game. 
Click "Text" to add text to your presentation.

Canva gives recommendations based on style and keywords which are helpful for making your characters and esigns cohesive. 

3) Create your first slide with your game's title. In this example, you can see that we included a "Start" graphic.

4) Create a slide that describes your game. Make sure on every slide you also include a button which allows you to move back or move forward.

5) Make a slide for each step of your game. We started by making one slide that has all possible options to start, and continued from there. 

6) Create a link from each interactive element to its corresponding page in the presentation. (For example, your "Start" button on page one should link to the first choice page). 

7) IMPORTANT: on every page that has clickable elements, you will want to create a transparent shape behind everything that links to the same page (this way, if someone misses the element, they don't get re-routed to a different page). This process is shown below. 
    * first, add in a rectangle element. Resize it so it's covers the whole slide (or gives a wide area around the clickable elements) 
    * next, link this rectangle to the same page you are on. 
    * send it backwards (command + [)
    * lower transparency to zero (gradient --> drag slider to zero)

8) Once you're done with your presentation, click "Share" and select "Website." Under "Web style," select whichever form of navigation you prefer. "Presentation" style will make a webpage that navigates like a normal presentation would; "Classic" navigation will create a website that doesn't move horizontally like a normal powerpoint does.
