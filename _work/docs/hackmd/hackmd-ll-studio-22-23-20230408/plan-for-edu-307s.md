# plan-for-edu-307s


thanks for meeting with us on Friday! I’m sending over the teaching team’s timing for the event on September 30th, so you have an idea how we’re thinking of spacing out the activities we discussed last week. Please let me know if you have any thoughts, ideas, questions, or anything else. Thanks so much!

2/3 tables, a couple of mics all running to one computer. Students will have an opportunity to rotate in these small groups to record audio responses to prompt. Suggest 30 seconds of audio, and roll with it if they have more to say.
