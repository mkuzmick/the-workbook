### thoughts from the studio

- hallway (and ultimately storage room 2) as paper-production zone---ultimately with the copier too
- get rid of everything next to the copier
- top shelves in brick room for horizontal lines of racks
- run cams-with-audio at 1080
- run 4K cams without audio, getting that synched in the a8k or a4k
- any 4K gets recorded to hypers
- note: we still haven't decided where we'll be at mic level and where line level
    - name drops with camera number, but remove 50/75' extensions every night (number with both permanent hub in and also current source number in the 8K)---when the cameras move, we need to remap automatically (like cam 6, control-wise, can move from hub in to hub in---when this happens, the new hub in number needs to be sent to the 8K so that cam number for control matches source number)
- get MPAs to pull cables
- order enough SDIs for new snake

### gear needed
- additional atem sdi iso
- additional atem constellation
- additional hyperdecks
- additional ultrastudios
- liquid for smoke machine
- [ultimatte 12 4k](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1720925-REG/blackmagic_design_ultmkey12_c_4k_ultimatte_12_4k_keyer.html)
- [ultimatte 12 HD](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1726949-REG/blackmagic_design_ultimatte_12_hd_keyer_advanced.html)
- more instrument hangers
- long thunderbolt 4 cables for studios to go up in the air
- additional studio displays
- additional mac studios or m2 mac minis
- wireless headsets for talkback or other intercom setup
- addition [cable spool in yellow](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1032049-REG/canare_l_4cfb_300m_yellow_l_4cfb_rg59_hd_sdi_coaxial.html) and maybe other colors
- 

### moves
- black and white on cue
- supersat
- looks (teal and orange, matrix, day-for-night)
- invert paper + black marker for luma key over subject
- 

### major tasks
- studio audio to 1080 cams, then to hub, then to amxs.a (or amxs.b?) for iso audio recording
- set up chauvet lighting system across top of blackboard wall . . . find or buy control unit
- master the intimidator system (test in garage at home)
- add image flip to system
- add ultimatte to system
- button setup to hallway
- fill blue with frequently-used-tech
    - chargers
    - headphones
    - microphones
    - gimbals
    - usb, ethernet, lightning, thunderbolt, dongles, 
- fill orange with frequently-used-art?
- use all 4 multiviews from 8K
- make 20x orange and purple 50'
- 

### small tasks
- ~~remove pipe crossing truss in brick room~~
- mac on truss branch -- for music studio?
- pull down all of the hanging mics that were just put up
- pull dead cables out of the central hub
- track all cable runs by cable number
- pull out everything not part of a well-tied snake
- why is monitor power switched? move to unswitched
- test shockmounted procaster on table for thumping noise
- run 1/4" from 8K to speakers for monitoring
- 


### potential lluf tasks
- cleaning at end of each day
- 


### audio notes

- have all mic signals run to cameras running at 1080 so that they can hit the amxs for iso audio recording
- mirror this in logic using the scarlett
- let's start this week
- ultimately 2 speakers at main stage, mics direct in--these two then on to cam 7
- then speaker for each table, again with mics direct in and then line out going to the camera associated with that location
- mics for amps and instruments
- 

### live sound notes

- main locations = 
    - 1. stage
    - 2. blackboard stage
    - 

### brick room computer notes

- needs
    - card capture
    - live stills
    - captions (mini)
    - lens studio filters (vfx)
    - ingest 1 (main)
    - ingest 2
    - 8k switcher (main?)
    - 4k switcher ++ ??
    - music

#### plan

1. music-studio gets the clarett and scarlett
2. main-studio runs the studio-bot, switches, ingests and has 2x drive bays
4. vfx-studio handles lens studio, ingests--for now it will get live stills
5. lluf-studio (to be bought) handles documentation, ingests
6. captions-mini logs in to google for captions
7. graphics-mini runs keynotes and others for graphics
8. copy-mini runs large copy jobs
9. live-studio (to be bought) captures live stills



- tv 2 across the middle bank: coming from orange 11 cable. Then looping out to control for Cam 1
- cam 1 to red 310
