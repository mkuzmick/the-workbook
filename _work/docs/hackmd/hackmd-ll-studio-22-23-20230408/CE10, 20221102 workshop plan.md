#### from maria's email
Please see my follow-up notes here:
* Yes, it would be great to have the overhead camera and tables for students for filming purposes. While not all groups utilized it last year, some students did find it helpful. So it would be great to still have that available, just in case
* Between 8:45 AM and 9 AM on Wednesday, 11/02/2022, our Course Assistant Laura will be stationed outside of the Bok Center entrance to direct students upstairs.
* Erika Bailey does plan to lecture on the “speaking to camera” segment. This is what she said “I speak about eye contact and how that is more complex on zoom or with a camera but I don’t spend much time on it.  I can’t imagine a repetition of the ideas would feel boring or redundant.”
* Please find [our final assignment filming rubric in the attachment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDXhyOWB64a-XT5zsZuA7PhEgt5dJmkL/view?usp=sharing).
* Here is a link to our class plan calendar, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n5wpqV_iuNQTtxOQXKFW5LL2QrqZ4dQTAAkSjnZRPUc/edit
* Here are two model examples from last year’s film, team 2 and team 3. From 2:16 - 8:30. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtCtCvb5y-Y
* As a friendly reminder, if you could please share your slides with us by 9 AM on 11/01/2022, that would be great.
