lightroom is a great
* photo organization tool
* basic editing

project file
storing editing decisions in catalogue
and then render out final file with edits

## steps
- create a new catalogue
    - file
        - new catalogue
            - in the _work drive
                - in the _lr folder
                    - add your catalogue "inital-lcat-demo-20230307"
                        - hit create!

On the top, there is a left to right timeline of tabs (Library, Develop, Map, Book, Sldieshow, Print, Web)

- Bring things into Library, and can view metadata there
    - click "import" on the bottom right
    - find the folder of images you want to select
        - by default all photos will be select, you can change this
    - the top and center of Lighroom will give you a choice to
        - copy
        - move
        - add
    - we like "Add" the best, this just references the files instead of copying or moving them. sometimes 
    - import

use the hiding triangles on the left and right of the screen to show you navigators and more information

### Library Module
in the library module
* select a photo
* type it in keyword tags
    * and then your previously typed tag will show up in keyword suggestions
* on the left, look at Collections and click +
* created smart collection
* and create based on tags

in the library module
* click on a photo
* use left and right arrow keys to navigate through images
* use the number keys to rate the photos
    * 1 - not going to use it
    * 2 - not sure
    * 3 - want to edit
    * 4 - edited and killer
    * 5 - edited and all time great

in the bottom right corner (you may have to click the triangle to bring the bottom toolbar up)
* where it says "Filters Off"
* change that to "Rated"

### Develop Module
Press "D" or click up top to go to the Develop Module
* there are Presets in the left navigation menu

In the right navigation menu, adjust various settings
* (need more specific notes here)
* post-crop vignetting is the most natural vignetting that exists
* HSL sliders allow you to select one color and affect only that color's hue, saturation, and luminance
* bandaid
    * adjust brush size with the square brackets

*do what you think looks good, and then dial it back 50% because as you're editing you will become desensitized and you want your edits to be subtle.*

### Print Module
can use this for making buttons!
