# notes as DD adding mdf projects to workbase
questions for christine: 
* for example, in celia and anna's plans for the year - CD included unique/specific/individual bullet points in their training/labs section.. not sure how to indicate this in airtable when everyone associated with the general lab/lab description is just getting linked!
    * this could be two things --
        * WORK, the kind of things they would share in show-your-work - how do we add work to these plans?
        * if they have comments and add them into these auto created docs that we share, how to get that back into airtable (and if it's individual to each person and not the project, WHERE does it go)
* I have been putting the text from the bullet points in "project description field" so I was going to put "Develop resources and activities that support student documentation & design" for TDM99A&B but we already have a paragraph description - should we have a field for bullet point description and a field for a longer paragraph?
    * we want TWO different fields - just added
    * related but different - gened1140's two projects - are they the same or different?
* Support Linda Wingerterâ€™s master class in puppetry technique, to be hosted at the Learning Lab (added to the workbase but not sure this is course support.. is this more departmental support?)
* malcolm's doc: (we skipped, will come back to)
    * is the embedded ethics thing more of departmental support? and then the senior thesis would be course support?
* for each "Project" of departmental support - i've been titling them a mix of MDF Fall Support and MDF Support - any thoughts?
* some docs (like Jessi's and Ryan, and Siriana) had a second page for departmental priorities and mdf learning goals - do we want those in airtable too? i haven't been adding those yet. Siriana's doc also had a lot more in the second page even.
* all of the detailed bullet points (ie. Sarah E's doc) - i've added them into project description for now but this probably is not the best place for them.
* question about ANTHRO1610 on Shanni's doc (I think Ria is just doing the workshop, but are these bullet points about the final project support that Shanni is also helping with? or is the assignment description about the final project assignment or the one due on Nov 9?)
    * Support ANTHRO 1610: Ethnographic Research Methods
        * Support in-class practice and student work on one assignment for the week of multimodal ethnography, due on Nov. 9. 
        * Assignment description: Experiment with an ethnographic method that captures the sensory aspects of your project and field site. Approaches may include drawing, mapping, photography, video or audio recording, or another method other than writing approved by the instructor. Please submit a file detailing your experiment, and a one-page report of what this experience contributed to your project.
* just reviewing breakdowns/names of projects :) 
* as we add spring projects, how to separate when creating auto docs (we are tagging metaprojects with semesters but not projects right now)
    * hum10 as an example of a course that is running in the spring but is being worked on by carly in the fall. i think we'd want terms associated with the project as well

things to add-
* emily - scrb111 consultations with each group
* siriana's music160R workshop
