## 20220809 meeting
MK, DD, AB, GG, CW

### messy notes
some art thing on the walls that lead you to the food/event
photo with a quote of teaching or our favorite teacher or some little fun thing

is someone prompting them? should they get cards with questions?

don't know the size of the turnout - so should feel cool but not like the highest cost/effort. etc.

GG doesn't know about airtable and would need help with that

they want colorful neon paper. we have more colors of 8.5x11.

AB asked about transcription of quote - MK psyched about this!
for ex) someone talking for a few minutes, how do we decide what to put in airtable to print? need an editorial person here! 

how are things getting into airtable? manually?
potentially have an ipad filling out a form that is populating the airtable for printing
fields could be: Name, Role, AffilDept, Quote, Image, maybe single select field or linked field for questions table "question" and wording for page designer"

INPUT
ipads
* forms
* photos

photobooth
* cams
* mics
    * google live transcript
    * zoom slightly async/ live

Bok staff
* listening + typing

screen outside the room could show what's happening in the team room on the camera and also a live transcript

each question could correspond to a different layout (using airtable views)

### action steps:
* everyone should slack ideas for what the print outs could look like
* GG will work on creating the fields
* GG sit down with someone (JK? DD? MK?) to design a page designer template
* AB + others to come up with prompts & also the delivery of the prompts
* LL will play around with the cameras and transcript possibilities
* LL team, starting Friday or next week, could set up in the team room to prototype (test with bok staff)
* live event support staffing help
    * Casey and a MPA will definitely be around to help
    

Friday 8/12 - JK&GG work on airtable? or maybe not?
Media folks work on bringing stuff over/setting up before 8/19
Friday 8/19 - dry run of photo booth
* figure out roles for that day
