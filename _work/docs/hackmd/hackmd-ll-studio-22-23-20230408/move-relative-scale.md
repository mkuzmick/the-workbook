# move-relative-scale

One thing we find ourselves doing frequently in 3d applications is showing the relative scale of a given object, moving from something unknown to something known, from an object we don't really have any (correct) physical or spatial intuitions about to something with a size we DO intuitively grasp.

## the challenge

in Blender, create a conjunction of two things: a large object and a map, say, or a small object we're not familiar with next to another object know well. If they are similar sizes, composite the two together as a still.

*(If you can't think of a good option for this one yourself, one we'd love to have is the Great Pyramid in a Cambridge/Harvard context.)*

You can also put together objects of quite different sizes, but it may make sense to animate from one to the other to achieve the desired effect. Like this animation from a star the size of our sun to a super-massive star.

## for bonus points

Add in some text and lines to create a scale or numerical measurements to give the viewer a more precise sense of the measurements. Or maybe add multiple objects, like so:

### key skills

- install import-images-as-planes [add-on](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html) and use it
- download various file formats from sketchfab and get used to importing them into blender
- add cameras and select intentional views/animations
- render out of blender (stills and video)
- think a bit about "relative scale" as a key visual move for your multimodal storytelling projects
