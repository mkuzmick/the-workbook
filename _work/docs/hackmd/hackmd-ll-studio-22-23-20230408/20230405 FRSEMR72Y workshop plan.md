- work on a rationale
    - who needs this?
    - what is this?

### notes from the instructor
[20230327 Consultation Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MjLrln3NRf-YuvIwKY7vN7gepun64y7UC6NfpWnJz-c/edit#)
* get them to fill out [the exit ticket]((https://docs.google.com/forms/d/126s0nZlclFXGrY2qQXhypbqhJrLN1b-lFXcFPc3W4PM/viewform?edit_requested=true)) at the end of the session
* what students wanted to get from the LL session:
    * I'm excited to see what everyone else has been working on! For me, it would be most helpful to have independent work time in the learning lab on April 5th.
    * I think that I'll be working on project editing on Canva during our Learning Lab time.
    * At the learning lab I would like to work on animating my video and specifically focus on adding audio.
    * I'm thinking of doing a video, unsure if for the whole project or just a piece of it, but either way I'd like to record in the learning lab on that day.
    * I want to research and contact community organizations and/or develop a framework for the course I'll be teaching. Something like a lesson plan, a script, and some outside references.
    * On April 5th I would like to work on my Canva website. I hope to have started on it and have some resources ready, but will most likely need to refine the presentation of my work.
