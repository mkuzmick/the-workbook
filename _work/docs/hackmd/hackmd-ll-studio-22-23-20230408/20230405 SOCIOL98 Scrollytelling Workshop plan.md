# 20230405 SOCIOL98 Scrollytelling Workshop plan
Andreja, Christine, and Anna

## plan
1. Short introduction by Andreja 
2. ANALYSIS IN GROUPS -- in pairs, apply the analytical "moves" to analyze media discourse pertaining to contentious memorials (provided by Andreja); jot down themes on colored index cards; briefly present results of the analysis to class (based on this, we should collectively generate a list of themes and case attributes) -- about 30 minutes
4. INDEPENDENT CODING ACTIVITY -- analyze the data that you have collected for your research project, focusing on the HIGHLIGHT analytical move; first, read through and open-code the text using a transparency; then, develop a codebook; finally, reanalyze the data using the codes you have developed -- about 20 minutes
5. INTER-CODER RELIABILITY TEST -- exchange data and codebooks with a partner and analyze your partner's data (again using a transparency); switch back and observe how closely they align -- about 15 minutes
6. DEVELOPING AN OUTLINE OF YOUR FINDINGS -- Make a copy of your coded data; cut out exerpts pertaining to each theme; organize them in outline form -- about 15-20 minutes
7. SUMMARY -- Summarize your results in Scrolly-telling format, displaying both your interpretation/summary and the data upon which it is based -- about 15-20 minutes
8. WRAP-UP -- talk about additional strategies that they can use to analyze their data; if there's time left over (doubt there will be), introduce them to nVivo, where they can do this digitally
