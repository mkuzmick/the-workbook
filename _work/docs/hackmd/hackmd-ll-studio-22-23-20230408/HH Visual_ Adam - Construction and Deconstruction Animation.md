i worked on the construction/deconstruction for a while but blender quit just as i was getting to a good point ðŸ˜© nonetheless i have a few options for the 'deconstruction' phase of the animation 
    for meeting tues march 21 
    - deconstruction: quick explode? opposite of construction (just move the walls back down?) 
    - do we like the idea of creating different configurations with the walls 
    - should i add color/textures or should it be the sort of standard gray (basically what aesthetics should we be going for?) 
    - i want to make this visually interesting in some way - not sure if that would mean adding an intermediate step (a rotation or rearranging of walls). basically it just seems to be a bit flat right now with the jump straight from construction to destruction
    - is there a way to make the explosion look better because the quick explode is a bit finicky and using the explode modifier is more time consuming 
    - how long should the animation be (obviously it doesn't need to be too long but should also still be visually interesting)
