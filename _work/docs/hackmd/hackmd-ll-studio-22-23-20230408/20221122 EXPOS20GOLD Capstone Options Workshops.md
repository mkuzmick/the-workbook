## Plan 

* students are excited about instagram posts but we want to get them excited about these other modes that can be incorporated in instagram posts

Workshop plan from consultation:
* Playing examples and unpacking them, why they’re cool, why you would choose them
* Taste of tools, stations 
    * Mic zone for podcasts
    * Camera zone for videos
    * Computer zone for graphic design elements of instagram posts (canva?)
* Wrap up: Here’s how we can support you
    * Office hours
    * Reserve space to record

### Notes from the Instructor (20221116 consultation):
Last time, marlon led them in a reflection exercise. Played a podcast, the vox chair video, couple of audio visual things and had them break it down. Then students went in groups and let them explore different options. Goal - each group should know what they want to do for their capstone (podcast, instagram)

Students default to instagram even tho AJ encourages them to explore different multimedia forms and branch out if possible. She wants them to do interesting things. * wants students to understand that videos don’t have to be super high tech to be engaging * Couple groups interested in podcast.

Video explainers - students seem to be reluctant to do that but aj would love them to do that. Even tik tok explainers.

They’re doing this in groups of 4, one group of 3. This year the groups could choose their own groups, had a cocktail mixer yesterday.

A group spoke to the classes last week about instagram carousel activism (@slacktivists).
