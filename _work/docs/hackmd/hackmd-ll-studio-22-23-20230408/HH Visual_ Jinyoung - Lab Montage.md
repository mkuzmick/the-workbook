## the directions:
### for this build...
there are 3 separate "mini" montages that we need, 3 exports. 
Video 1 (Jinyoung walking into the building): ~15 sec
Video 2 (Jinyoung doing chemistry): ~20 sec
Video 3: (Jinyoung trying to build an A/C): ~30 sec

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
