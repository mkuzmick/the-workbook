# 0.1-development-environment

- sign up for github acct (optional)
    - if you do this you'll also need to get a personal access token to sign in when the time comes
    - 
- sign up for vercel acct (optional)
- install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with 
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
    - if you are on Apple Silicon, you may be prompted to run an extra bit of shell script when the install is done. Go ahead and do this, but if you do you can add that code here to improve this tutorial.
- once homebrew is installed
    - `brew install git`
    - `brew install node`
    - `brew install visual-studio-code`


## extras

### shell sidequest

- if you don't have a `Developer` folder in your home folder, let's create it in the Terminal
- use `cd` to get to your home folder with `cd ~` (though if you open a new terminal, odds are you'll be in this folder already)
- then `mkdir Developer` if you want to go with the old Apple norm of a `~/Developer` folder. But if you are believe this term to fail at achieving parallelism with the other terms in your home folder (`Music` and `Documents` and `Movies` and basically stuff you make), then maybe `Development` is more parallel? Your choice! You will look like more of a pro and be more like everyone else if you use `Developer`, but maybe that's just because not enough writing teachers have been involved in determining coding norms :)
- once you have made your folder (mine was made with `mkdir Development`), change directories into it with `cd Development` (or whatever you called your folder)

#### add
