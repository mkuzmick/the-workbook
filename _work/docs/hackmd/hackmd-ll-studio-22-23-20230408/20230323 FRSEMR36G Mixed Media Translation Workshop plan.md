# 20230323 FRSEMR36G Mixed Media Translation Workshop plan

## plan
planning notes go here!

- Stephanie will talk to them about *The Clock* for 15-20 minutes 
- We will do some introducing and then split them into two groups, at which point they'll go through some stations/translations
- Anna's ideas for the stations (location-based):
    - Small studio: reading aloud (maybe with collage)
    - Stage: reading aloud, gesturing (we capture GIFs?), using the camera to capture their peers doing so
    - Music: using Logic & the piano to overlay sound with the readings
    - Table: working with physical film strips to translate film, maybe combined with collage? (Christine) (small studio)
    - Computer: 3D?, digital editing, Canva paint-by-number video creation (Marlon) 
    - Tentative flow for taking them through said stations:
        - 1: Group 1 (with Anna) in small studio while group 2 is with Siriana (at music)
        - 2: Group 1 goes to Siriana at music, group 2 goes to stage/capture/gesture with Anna
        - 3: Group 1 stays with Siriana and goes to stage/capture (if that is okay! and group 2 stays with Anna to go to the small studio
        - 4: Group 1 goes to the film table (small studio) with Christine, group 2 to the computer table with Marlon (maybe we give more time for this station?) 
        - 5: Group 1 goes to the computer station with Marlon, group 2 to the film table (small studio) with Christine (same about time)
        - So, group 1 "choreography": Small studio -> music -> stage/camera -> film -> computer
        - Group 2: music -> stage/capture -> small studio ->  computer -> film 
            - Though this makes me think that music could be hard to start with? In which case they could do stage -> small studio -> music

    Music: Tracy K. Smith, translation of Yi Lei's "Red Wall" in folder [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvnOnmbK_k7uNNN3Q4B-II9CDC-0HbCO/view?usp=share_link),
