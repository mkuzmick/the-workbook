## plan

### planning meeting notes
* introduction (~10 minutes - JK)
* staff will pitch their tools for breakout rooms (garageband, audacity, logic)
* get students to try making a 1-2 minute podcast (~45 minutes)
    * importing an audio clip (like field audio)
    * trimming that audio
    * adding another clip that is voice over narration or recording directly into the software
    * arranging the audio like puzzle pieces
    * (?) adjusting the levels of everything (?)
    * add music for emphasis, punctation, setting the mood/tone
    * then you adjust the levels
    * then exporting
* come back together to share
* wrap up
    * LL Editing Office Hours
        * starting November 1st through the end of the term – we’ll be holding editing office hours Monday-Thursday 3-5pm and Friday 9am-5pm (with the exception of dates our office is closed: 11/11, 11/24, and 11/25). 

## space and gear prep

## media prep
* CC will send Siriana a link to tell students how to convert audio to get it to work with audacity
* JK will have a google drive folder with assets
* JK will make a handout for garageband then send to Siriana to adapt it for Audacity
## live event support

### notes from the instructor
#### 20221021 email 
I'm attaching [our podcasting assignment prompts for this year as a compiled PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pEaw0EIPdDPm6opCHiG-EYnVX32BnDz/view?usp=sharing), for your reference. As of now, we're not sure how many students will pair up but we told them to let us know by the end of this weekend if they'd like to work together. I can write back with an estimate early next week, when the partnership proposals trickle in. We have 72 people enrolled in the course. Lastly, I will send out an announcement to the class encouraging them to install the applications ahead of time.

#### 20220914 Consulation notes: 
Students first submit a draft and then the final version two weeks alter
Tomiko interested in hearing if we have feedback on the prompts (doesn’t have to be right now). To make sure students start working. Draft is also graded. They’d have two weeks to finish it off and do the production.

Draft is not recorded, it’s just written. (ahead of the game students might run out the script). Atleast they’re working on an idea. So right when they submit the draft, they’ll start working on the production. So that might be a good time for the tutorial. Draft is due oct 29 

MK said they should think about the pieces of audio/media that might go into the podcast (which is part of the draft). If they do the workshop as theyre working on the draft, that might be helpful for them to see why

MK asked what if the workshop was launching them on the assignment? Show them how to edit and also acquire different pieces of media. We could give them a template for things they could fill out and use in the draft.

Well create a template google doc that they can duplicate and work on themselves during the session - that have spots for all of the things tomiko wants from them. 

Tomiko asked if we recommend students work with their smartphones to capture audio and edit themselves using software
MK said yes, we teach phone based podcasting. We teach them best practices for recording on your phone. 
MK asked if they are doing it as individuals or more in groups?
Tomiko said she’s not sure yet. She’s giving options. Last time, during earlier covid, most of them did individually. Some did form a pair though. This year they have quite a few freshman who maybe have housemates they want to work with.
