### ask
Slacks from Ryan
* "It would be for their Final Gallery project . We've recommended Canva, SketchUp, Blender, and Unity. We've also added ClipStudio Paint for figures and images for the galleries (but we're open to recommendations)."
* "I could come in tomorrow at 9? Otherwise, we were thinking more of a tour of the tools with y'all and not necessarily working on computers. The idea is that they get an introduction to the range of possibilities and then can dive deeper into one or two if they think it will be helpful"
