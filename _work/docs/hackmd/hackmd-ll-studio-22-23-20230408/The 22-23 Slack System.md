# 22-23-slack-system


## types of channels

- the `show-your-*` channels that are meant to be public displays of things you want to share with people
- the `save-your-* `channels that are really just meant to be a way to hold on to frequently-used file attachments in slack, and then
- the `do-this-thing` type channels that may be created for random workflows---we should try when possible to create bots for this purpose, but I can imagine us sometimes not having time for this
