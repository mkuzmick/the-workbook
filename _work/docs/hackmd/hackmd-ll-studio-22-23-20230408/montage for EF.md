# montage for EF

## background:
the LL creates farewell montages for departing staff. these montages are a few minutes long (depending on how much footage can be found), ideally made up of video clips but still photos are also fine if needed, sometimes with a soundbite if there are any good ones.

## deadline:
we'd like this done by Thursday, Dec 22 (before the winter recess), so we can send to adam for review. final video needs to be ready to go by 4pm on Thursday, January 5.

## photos dani could find, but there likely is more

* https://flic.kr/p/2gBE4Jv (this photo was taken by someone at the Gazette so it doesn't exist in our records)
* https://flic.kr/p/TLFFTA (20190509_001_PF_Orientation_Stills_090.jpg)(there might be video of this too)

* https://flic.kr/p/2gX388m (20190327_002_GenEdTrailer_Brainstorm_C300a_001_11214216.jpg) - **adam definitely wants this photo in, but there is almost definitely good video from this shoot!**
