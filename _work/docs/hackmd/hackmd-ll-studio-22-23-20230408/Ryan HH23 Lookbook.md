### Chalkboard aesthetic
Chalkboard drawings bring a unique aesthetic to the representation of homelessness, emphasizing its impact and urgency. The raw, handwritten style conveys a personal touch, highlighting the humanity behind this complex issue.

### Bloodspot Cards
The collection of CRP measures in clinical studies is crucial for obtaining accurate results. This is accomplished through the use of bloodspot card technology. The simplicity and reliability of bloodspot cards ensure accurate measurement of CRP levels in study participants. Here are some sample images of bloodspot cards.

## notes from session 1 (20230127):

molecule of crp specific would be nice to have.  

how do you register "get under the skin" ?

concrete humans, enviromentmet to molecules - so many different worlds to go through. exciting to think about how to tell that story visually.

you have the molecule inside the bloodstrem and then it increases inside the body-like in fight club where it zooms through the body.

how to create a visual that shows housing insecurity and homelessness without being insensitive or exploitative. this is a key challenge.

depictions of data scientists vs public health specialists -- working with code/data


### mk notes from 20230210

- childhood housing insecurity and homelessness
- what is "biological embedding"--how does it "get under the skin"?
- 3 causal factors: psychosocial stressors, physical conditions, health behaviors
- but then also how they interact with their care-giver
- how to represent inflammation?
- a molecule we can measure: c-reactive protein
    - we can measure this in people with housing insecurity
    - then can we also show that it correlates to long-term health outcomes
- isolating the variable illustration?
- 3 studies
    - is homelessness linked to depression and anxiety (some debate that these effects are a function of poverty)
        - argues that there is an independent effect
    - is there a connection to c-reactive protein?
        - go into methods? or no?
- then what we can do/why does this matter?
    - we could prescribe housing as a health intervention
- what are the steps in answering this complex questions?
    -
