## plan

- example
Serves as both the object of analysis & breakdown for students and the model for end-product
- agenda
    * audience : who are they speaking to? what is their audience?
    * formal analysis : brainstorming based on keywords (specific to each station)
    * why?
    * medium : how are they using the medium? what could YOU use?

### speech station

### keywords

## space and gear prep
