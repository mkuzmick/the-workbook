#### 20220929 notes from check in with julia
CD + JK will lead the workshop
Julia says don’t need to reinvent the wheel - JK last year made soundbite recordings and prepared quite a bit of work. Julia said she’d love those to be reused (DD to look for this stuff)

DD found this from last year: https://hackmd.io/7lYd9WouS3GoArFaGkRC4A?view 
Julia sent Jordan a reading or two and made this hackMD and also did a recording of her talking about reading something from one of the readings 
Julia said what Jordan did last year was terrific
Not all students will be present because of Yom Kippur so Julia said the hackMD is great to have for students to miss

MK said we’ll be doing online office hours this year and we can let Julia know when those are happening
She said hackathon last year depended on group dynamics - worked for forward planners but not for those who waited a bit and did their own thing. She thinks the hackathon are a great idea to make things available for students - this could be run instead of section that week

(julia hasn’t specified a date about the hackathon - can include in our call to action after the workshop?)

Julia sent us the assignment prompt: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RbQ47y4tiL7uFjKDpfM7UEVGLX7zFZT3 
Julia said no one wanted to do prompt 2 so it’s not an option anymore- students like 1, 3, and 4
Julia said Jordan already integrated the idea of connections from the assignment prompt into the workshop plan
