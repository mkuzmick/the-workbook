## ideas we've heard

(about things people would like to learn or make)

### Labs
- realityLab/gameLab: more Unity and Video Games resources and activities for Carly's course and other projects
    - including coding (C# scripting for instance)
- LLUFs: more Adobe Creative Cloud literacy across the LLUF group for office hours
    - single-serving learning opportunities
- webLab, codeLab? potentially front-end development for gallery and other projects coming out of scroll-lab?
    - Jessi making galleries, probably in Wix or Webflow
    - some MDFs coding?
    - could tie to our fellows reporting
- AcademicPresentationLab
    - HH
    - AVLab: chalktalk
    - TinyDesk
    - senior thesis writers
    - Museum of Natural History group
- MinisLab
    - array of activities that can be done for a whole workshop and/or stations that can be combined and remixed
        - that can be done in the LL space
        - JK's single serving, potentially self-directed learning projects
        - cool for MPAs to work on as well, if they're up for it (could think about live event badging)

### LL Systems

    - redesigning small rooms and spaces on the office side of 50 Church
        - storage rooms
            - activating so these can be workspaces too

    * MPAs could test them or could help build them
    * should have cool deliverables associated with them - ie. the album cover challenge
    * all things go into video games so that can be the umbrella
        * like when to use photoshop or illustrator vs. blender etc.
            * game backgrounds

    * we want llufs to learn garageband and logic and we want them to generate audio assets, and we want MDFs to help generate the prompts
    * audio ideas-
        * cut scene audio
        * production of sounds (like Andrew is psyched about)
* Web Zone: Galleries and Portfolios
    * simplifying the process of getting data from airtable to wix for jessi
