Reframing main camera
Test strips (figuring exposure levels for these cameras)



Ensure everything is recording.

All naming schemes definded by three indicaters:
1. Room Location (main table is table 1, to left is table 2, 3 then 4)
2. Relative location cam a cam b cam (up to 5 cam a's)
3. Input #

t2=table2
camA=overhead camera

ultrastudio is an interface

21-30 is 4k ins

cam b is wide shot

Aa is table cam 1, Ab is table cam 2
