### Notes from the Instructor:

Session 1 
* In session one I will explore my own journey into content production. I will discuss the mistakes I  made along the way and what these mistakes taught me about effective communication of ideas.  
*  will also use examples of my own work to illustrate how I managed to gain the tools to create  content in the way that I do. 
* The students will then be given the task of, before the next session, watching a video of mine on YouTube,  Instagram or TikTok and then breaking down some of the most notable production aspects of the video. 

from Ed - "In terms of an example video, I think this one is a good one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml2ZBDuLNXk"

#### Ed visit notes
6 sessions in total - each divided into how they normally break down production.
* 1st session - introduction to Ed, and outlining the next sessions. asking students to talk about their favorite content creators - what they do well, what they can do better
* 2nd session - gets into the production side of things
* 3rd session - script writing, storyboarding
* 4th session - presentation. and students can come in during drop in sessions
* 5th session - editing
    * maybe we want to do a survey of students to ask about if they've done editing before, what tool would they want to use, would they be using our machines or their machines
    * microproject- creating this survey before the 
* 6th session - discussing how to transfer these skills to making content outside of their capstone and for different social media platforms, and just using them beyond as well
