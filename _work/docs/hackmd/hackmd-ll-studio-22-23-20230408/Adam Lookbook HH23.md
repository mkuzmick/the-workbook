## notes from session 1 (20230127):

start with stage set -- looks like real city, then look closer and look at the details --decieve the audience

US military logo gives away that it is a training ground - zoom in on that detail

has these photos.

----

SLC example- created exact replicas of Japanese homes, including moisture content of wood. to test nepalm weapons on these homes. 


stagecraft/warcraft--the fabricated-ness of this matters, and is something architects do

how buildings come apart, not just how they come together. weaponizing a knowledge about the city.

language of maps, buildings will be important. adam send us any animations of maps & buildings.
