### Notes from the Instructor:

#### Workshop Plan

* Set up the workshop in their classrom at Sever
    * group students
    * assign locations by passing out cards
* Send students into the yard to their assigned location to take photos and record audio (locations below are finalized)
    * The Widener stairs
    * Mem Hall Transcept
    * Memorial Chapel
    * Smith Center
* Reconvene in the LL so each group can present
    * Their job is to describe with a photo what snagg-ed them. We’ll have a map in the studio and they’ll have to talk about in the microphone.
    

#### Context
Framing - *all the time you’re engaging with arguments and you don’t realize it because they sound like narratives or stories. They're arguments about what matters, what’s important.*
You’re encountering a tiny tip of the iceberg when you listen to a podcast. [The next part of course is the research paper, which is the rest of the iceberg. The students will work on research papers, and then turning them back into tiny tip of the icebergs again for their final project.]

Over the weekend, pre LL workshop - students listen to [The Fugitive episode of Uncivil](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/uncivil/z3hdrm). 

*What does it mean to go look at an object, ask questions, and then find evidence? As opposed to starting with an already-drawn conclusion and then looking for evidence to support that?*

Students' homework for Wednesday's session is looking over their notes and sending a writeup of their question about the tour, and two possible explanations.
