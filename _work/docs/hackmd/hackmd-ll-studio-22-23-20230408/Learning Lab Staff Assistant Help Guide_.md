# Learning Lab Staff Assistant Help Guide: 
## Populating Client/Project Logs:
Client logs are the one stop shopping place for all information regarding a metaprojects. This is where you can find past emails, any consultation notes, etc.
* It is the responsibility of the Staff Assistant to put together the client logs and to keep on top of them to make sure that they have the most updated information.
    * when creating the logs go through and copy and past all relevant email communication. Additionally go through "notes by day" and copy over any consultation notes.
        * The "notes by day" is where the program coordinator puts all consultation notes. 
## Creating HackMD's:
The workshop HackMD's are the space where the team is able to put down any planning, ideas, or to do's before the workshop. 
* Use the template to create a new document
    * Click on the three dots next to the green "New Team Note" button and select new note from template, from there select workshop plan template.
* fill in course title, date and other information like the "When, Where, and enrollment"
    * Note that we write dates by year, month, day with no spaces (example: 20221101)

## Morning Routine: 
* On Monday mornings there is always a team meeting. This is the point in the week when everyone decides main priorities and discusses any upcoming workshops. 
    *  You should always slack the workshop HackMD's/client logs to the team for the week during this time.
* Go through the calendar and figure out what is happening that day and what rooms will be in use. 
    *  On the Google calendar select all the room calendars for the office.
    *  Write on the white boards in front of the rooms what is going that day.
* Check your emails and then also check the Learning Lab email. Make sure there is nothing pressing for the day.
    * You will mostly be helping the program coordinator schedule things, however, when they are out the staff assistant is responsible for the email.
    * It is important to read through the email everyday to know what is going on and to keep the Client Logs up to date.

## LLUF Stuff: 
* It is very important to keep on top of the LLUF slack channel and make sure that we are updating the LLUF Ideal Calendar with their most recent availability.
    *    Be careful when entering availability as often we make the events recurring so if you change one you change them all! 
* Every Friday you need to do an Airtable reset and document all the hours that the LLUF's have worked in the past week.
    * In the Airtabe "JK just a copy" go through and write down all the hours that the LLUF's worked and send to Jordan. From there change the filters to the next week. 
        * We do this so that Jordan is able to quickly look and see how many hours she is giving each LLUF when she creates the shifts. 
## Breakdown of Metaprojects, Microprojects and Projects: 
* Metaprojects - A full course that we are helping with and will continue to assist with past the years classes. Normally when a professor reaches out to us we are going to have a lot of smaller planning to do for each individual workshop so we create one large metaproject that will cover all the information for smaller workshops. 
    * A metaproject can span for several years. 
    * A metaproject can have several courses/classes attached to it. 
* Projects - A project is normally a class. It is often a workshop or other event that we are in charge of running/organizing. 
* Microprojects - A microproject is a smaller part of the project that would normally only take a couple of hours. It is the "prep" or the "small" things that need to get done before we start working on the project.
