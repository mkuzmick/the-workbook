# FRENCH11 Final Oral Exams microproject prompt

## Background
### Project description


### Ask
 
from Nicole Mills - To follow-up on my previous request, I would love to do similar recordings for the French 11 (Beginning French II) students (if possible!) For their final oral exam, they have to meet in partners for a 20 minute "informed discussion" in French on Wednesday, Nov. 30th. This is last year's topic. We will have 1 to 2 sections so I imagine that we would need about ten 20-25 minute time slots on that date.

## Elements
* Setting up one room (TBD on which room) for these recordings
*
 
## Tools

## Deliverable
