### notes from the instructor: 

#### Pre-Assignment on Canvas:
“Explore a digital resource from the list available on Canvas, or another that you’ve heard of. Brainstorm a project that would use this resource toward A) a one-off section meeting, and B) a semester-long project.”

#### 20221123 notes from check in
An array of tools that could be used to 
And scaffolding activities

Storymaps
Timelines

MK proposed- take a bunch of tools, and think about them all as alternatives to an academic essay. Video essays and podcasts as one cluster. And think about in class activities that could prepare students for a capstone activity of that sort, OR just ala carte if the final was still an essay.

Anne excited about exposing folks to the tools and their pedagogy. Thinking about these tools as ways to teach.

Siriana remembered a chance to design a multimedia assignment - is that the same for this workshop or is it just a buffet.

MK’s pitch: We could introduce options at a high level, talk about learning objectives that each achieves vs. each other. Then group moments where students get into groups and pitch an idea they have about what to do with their subject matter. And then having the students having a hands on taste of tools.

Anne asked siriana what she remembered from the previous one siriana attended: Siriana remembered a mic taste test, then spoke about different tools, then left off with thinking about an assignment they’d like to do and how to scaffold. 

Siriana excited about learning timeline.js and storymaps - can pick up quickly and give big learning payoffs. Anne agrees with siriana that students have more familiarity with microphones and audio editing.

Lee also suggested a pre-assignment on the canvas page - as a placeholder, he has a google maps and directions to the LL. and “Explore a digital resource from the list available on Canvas, or another that you’ve heard of. Brainstorm a project that would use this resource toward A) a one-off section meeting, and B) a semester-long project.”

MK suggested engaging in the question of how best to present music research in a multimodal form. Siriana exploring live presentations and it might be interesting to mention that.

7 students, no accommodations. (and 1 student is not teaching right now but will be in the spring)

#### 20221101 Consultation Notes: 
Anne said that their flagship journal can support audio and visual examples

* MK asked if they could imagine assigning a 12 minute video essay like Adam Neely might do. MK said we can play a couple of those - open a conversation about what people like and don’t like. Then talk about what would be involved in that, what skills would you need, how could you scaffold this.
    * Anne and said Lee that would be great to include and definitely interesting to people.

* MK brought up Chris and Siriana - interest in grad students turning one chapter of dissertation into an alternative media piece - they are offering something like that in the spring - this might connect to the Adam Neely thing
    * Let’s see if Siriana can come to this workshop (DD can do this) to get to her and her role and talk about the tiny desk event

##### We can report back to them about
Whether siriana can come
What tools we’ll show so they can pass that on to students
- multimedia essays and presentations
    - timeline js
    - storymaps
    - podcasts
    - video essays
    - canva
    - 3d environments (whether rendered in advance or in realtime)
- scaffolding activities leading to these sorts of things
    - online music interactives
    - consumer-grade tools for music production used for learning purposes
    - breaking apart the podcast or video essay into its elements
    - 
Instructions on how to get to the LL


##### Workshop learning goals:
Ways to approach galvanizing students
What grad students can do with their own research 

##### So things we can show during the workshop:
Storymaps
Timeline.js
