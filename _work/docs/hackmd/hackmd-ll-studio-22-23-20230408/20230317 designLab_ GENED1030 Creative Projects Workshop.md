## assignment prompt
Final project: Due May 3, at the start of exam period. Possible projects include: (i) an eight-page essay on a theme common to two of our authors; (ii) a dialogue between two or more of our authors; (iii) an audiovisual or media project (produced using resources at the Bok Center) that critically dramatizes themes of the course; (iv) a web, audiovisual, or medial project of some other kind, chosen and designed in consultation with your TF. You’ll meet with your TF before midterm week to discuss possible topics and forms of your final project, and you’ll submit an outline or draft by the end of March.

## notes
Min Ji will try to get a better sense of how many people will be joining. enrollment is about 50 - Min Ji is thinking maybe half, MK is thinking between 5 and 20.

we'll see if MPAs can stay late.

options for creative project presented to the course:
* video rendition of the dialogue (which they have the choice of doing on paper as well) ie. a presidential debate, performing in front of the green screen or as a podcast, etc.
* political speech (give a speech as one of the people they've read) - either in front of the camera or as an audio recording
* political campaign - based on their own technical expertise (video editing? after effects? marketing/social media? their choice)

workshop idea: production of political ad (because that would involve a lot of the components of these different options)

Min Ji was thinking it would make sense to more of a breakdown of the political work. (like a close reading?) scaffolding backwards from what you hope to achieve and what do the steps involve


Min Ji thinking just walking through 1 ad would be better than multiple

bill clinton having practiced in the chair?

printing press

could use montage to respond acting as someone to someone else? 

Min Ji is wondering about making a survey sheet for the end of the workshop where they let us know what they are now thinking for their final project, and then that could inform Min Ji on how best to support the students after

from MK: goals should be to teach them how to record audio, video, and edit together (even in canva). if they want to do something more complex they should come to office hours

Min Ji thinking maybe it's better for them produce a tiny speech instead of a political ad. instead of making them write something, Min Ji could come with excerpts (different speeches). 
* beginning do a close reading of the speech (body language, gesture, position of camera, etc.)
* then students go to different groups depending on the text they choose
    * have them break down the text into different elements
    * then end with students recording and using basic editing skills


MK suggesting stations of building blocks that they can choose one or as many as they want to use for their project
* video
* audio
* visual storytelling

Min Ji interested in storyboarding

## narrowing in on a plan
from CD + Min Ji brainstorming stations
* the voice: political dialogue (podcast/small studio) to your interlocutor
* the body: political speech (2 stations: green screen and cameras angles) to your supporters
* visuals + typoraphy: political campaign (graphic design) to nondesript public
    * canva + art supplies

with periodic check ins where someone shares every so often
