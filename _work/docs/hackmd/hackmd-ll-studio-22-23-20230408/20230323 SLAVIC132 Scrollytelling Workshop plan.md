# 20230323 SLAVIC132 Scrollytelling Workshop plan

## plan
* staff lead: anna

- Students from Slavic 132 (Russia's "Golden Age") will be coming in to talk about a scrollytelling project. They will be given physical materials (excerpts of texts, images, etc) and asked to mark them up and layer them. 


- Plan for the activity:
    - 10 minutes of introduction to types of scrollytelling moves (using the materials we prepared for the designlab in the fall) and the activity
    - 20-30ish minutes of work time (in groups at different tables, though each table will have similar materials)- Anna (or other MDFs if they can come!) walking around to talk through ideas, etc
    - 10 minutes (near the end of their work time) we come around to help them capture images of their work)
    - 5 minutes: we show them how to create the scrollytelling on ArcGIS Storymaps and how to put the images in
    - 15 minutes: in groups, they put their images into StoryMaps
    - 10-15 minutes: they share! We discuss
