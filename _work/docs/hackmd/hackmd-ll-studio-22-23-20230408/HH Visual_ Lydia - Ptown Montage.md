# HH Visual: Lydia - Ptown Montage
## the ask:
a short montage of Provincetown, MA in the summer

Tools: FCPX or Pr

## 20230328 NEW DIRECTIONS:
work on the video timing
* switch the order of the fireworks shot and the drone shot
* get some shots inside ptown bars and clubs 
* maybe end with more drone footage before fading to black
* *overall match the video order of media to script*

### notes
* (we may need to refine the timing additionally after she rehearses more)
* jk's suggestion - bring the video from dress rehearsal 1 on 20230327 into final cut below the montage to compare timing!

## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKb7SZXXdjAd8hIjghmLISCc417sw-wL)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvtK1H7ECMTfMiUYwHva9lPe0S6GvF6c). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/145hAK-CCJX7KA6_ymiASec3uRXYPOG7C/view?usp=share_link) . The montage in question happens at the very beginning of the talk.

### previous directions
### for this build...
* we want the following series of shots, in order:
  1. shot approaching
  2. then street shots
  3. then beach
 
 * we can include adobe stock or istock samples that we could buy later. a good search term could be "provincetown drone"
 * there are also some images we've sourced [on the slacks here](https://bokcenter.slack.com/archives/C03U2AY6L74/p1677609531779169) you might include




### when you are done
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of media in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * tag yourself!
