# mk-microproject-photoshop-challenge-001

the challenge.

1. find at least 5 photos of LLUFs (with more or less the same amount of each person in the photo--i.e. all medium shots, or close-ups)
2. bring them all into the same Photoshop document as layers
3. select the people and create masks based on these selections to make the backgrounds invisible
4. create different creative gradient maps to colorize the images
5. arrange into a cool composition or two (maybe different colored strips, say)
stacey's notes
everything is at the bottom
select subject is another way to isolate the person from the picture
make sure your object select tool is within the the picture 
click add vector mask which is at the bottom 
gradient: half-circle press gradient mapping 
double click layers to create clipping mask that applies changes to the layers below it
