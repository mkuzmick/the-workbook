# systems meeting 20220921
MK+DD

## notes
it would be awesome to make templates + think about what goes together for each kind of THING

project = assignment support
- microproject => plan & deliver workshop A
- microproject => thankyou for workshop A
- microproject => plan & deliver workshop B
- microproject => thankyou for workshop B
- etc
- 

project = workshop or workshop series
- microproject => plan & deliver workshop
- microproject? => materials for workshop
    - if this is necessary, the prompt for these will be created by workshop leader for LLUFs or other to gather them
- microproject => live support of workshop
- microproject => thankyou for workshop


hours example for Sheza workshop
- mk & cy & cc & jk & aa & ma & ac: 3 hours x 7 people = 21 hrs
- also prep = 3-4 * 2-3 hours at least = 10++
- also reporting = 10++


designLab
* doc elements
    * people: host = MK, but other activity leaders listed, participants listed
    * activities/tests: what are the 1-3 things we are doing?
    * reference docs
    * outline (created by MK)
    * IF there is work to be done after the dLab, then the leaders will produce prompts for the LLUFs

resource
* prompt
    * in hackmd, create a resource that explains how to _____
    * you can include embedded youtube and linkedIn tutorials
    * you can include models and examples 

lookbook
* prompt


thankyou template
- dani will send an email back to the faculty/course team during the week following the workshop (or other event). 
- It can include
    - attached photo files
    - links to flickr or other public photo galleries
    - links to google folder full of images
    - links to google folder full of video clips (of presentations, say)
    - in some cases we will drop off buttons or other physical media in person (in which case the email will merely mention this and tell them when and where to watch out for this package)
    - peak and other gifs
    - printed cards or other materials
    - gifs of all the cards
    - scrollytellings of all the cards
- we should also have "call to action" or note on next steps. In some cases this will be happening this term, in other cases we'll think more about what future collaboration might look like.
- in some cases we might want to make some of this media public, and we'll want to have a basic ask (or basic instructions) that start this process
- we can also ask whoever led the workshop for 
    - key takeaways or reflections, new things you did
    - anything you overheard students saying?
    - potentially even a workshop description/summary at this point
    - are there resources we should send back?
    - are there links we should send back?


## brainstorming

### microprojects

- types of microprojects for the slash command
    - events
        - workshops
        - consultations/meetings/office hours
        - hackathons
        - capstones
    - resources
        - lookbooks
        - resources (but break this down a bit? how-to hackmds, tutorials, show-and-tells of certain sorts)
        - prototypes
    - reporting/storytelling
        - reports
        - stories
        - show your works (show and tells here too)
        - lab reports
        - thankyous
    - studio/media/infrastructure
        - code
        - capture
        - maybe editing goes here?
        - mpa tasks?

#### what should the slash command do?
- create a record in the table with 
    - the right type
    - the title
    - description
    - any associated deadline
    - project? project link? (harder to do)
- create a doc
    - with the right template
    - adding the link for this doc to the Airtable record
- send record and doc link to user
- add record and doc link to some view the user can see of "my current projects" or some such
- add collaborators?
- (maybe?) adding a few actions that would be linked to the microproject
- specify short name or URL


### work

- show your work
- show and tell
- show your images
- etc
-
