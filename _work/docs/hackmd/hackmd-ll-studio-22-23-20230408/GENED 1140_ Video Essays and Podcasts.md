# GENED 1140: Video Essays and Podcasts

[media assets folder!](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1luMLIWxfACy_LqtyfxNt2R8fReergda1)

## WORKSHOP OUTLINE
We are excited to work with you on your podcasts and video essays! The Learning Lab folks around for the workshop in case you forget: 

* Christine, Assistant Director of the Learning Lab
* Ryan Low,  Media & Design Fellow in History

To get us started supporting you, we have a few activities that will give you a sense of how & why we might communicate our academic ideas through the medium of podcasts and video essays.

## The Elements of a Podcast
We'd love to start by taking some time to deconstruct just the first bit of a podcast, and unpack all the elements involved. We will do a close reading (or close listening!) of the first 30 seconds of a podcast called [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) and map out how the different audio elements work together temporally.

#### The Prompt:
1. Just listen to the first 30 seconds of this podcast and reflect on what you are hearing, and what that evokes.
2. Listen again...
3. And again.
4. As you begin to identify the different elements, start mapping them out. How many elements can you hear? How do they interact/intersect? What functional roles are they playing to support the content?

## Video Essays

Video essays deploy visuals, audio, and sometimes text in order to make an argument or convey key data to an audience. Let's unpack the start of a video together and think about its moves, much in the same way that we just did with the podcast episode.

Some great examples of video essays include these Now This videos [about Title 42](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1512891348218699778) and [border and climate politics](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1513246186546683905), as well as the Vox "explainer"-style video below about a chair featured on multiple album covers.

### Downloading from YouTube

By far the safest and most reliable way to download from YouTube is to use [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/), a simple command line tool. 

To use it on Windows:
1. install [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you don't already have it
2. `choco install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

To use it on Mac:
1. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it
2. `brew install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

If you want a specific format:
1. `youtube-dl -F [your/URL]` to see all formats so you can select the number of the format you want--let's say "22"
2. `youtube-dl -f 22 [your/URL]` to download

be sure to `cd /Users/me/Desktop/folder-i-want-my-stuff-in` first!

Here's [another resource about downloading video clips](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/SOCIOL1142/Found-and-archival-footage).

You can also use online methods at your own risk.
