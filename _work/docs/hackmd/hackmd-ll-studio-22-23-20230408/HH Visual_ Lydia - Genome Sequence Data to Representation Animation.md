# HH Visual: Lydia - Genome Sequence Data to Representation Animation
## the ask:
make a transition animation from the complex real data to the simplified representation graphic

Tools: Adobe After Effects



## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKb7SZXXdjAd8hIjghmLISCc417sw-wL)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z8gq8j1TYV6dchvA-UugC1swQnOGLZQE/view?usp=share_link). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/145hAK-CCJX7KA6_ymiASec3uRXYPOG7C/view?usp=share_link) . The montage in question happens at the very beginning of the talk.

## the directions:
### for this build...
the two side by side figures would be animated from one to the other. we want to retain the ability to go in either direction. so either start with the very complex, highlight the mutations with dots of colors, fade the data away-- leaving only the dots and a straight line. the straight line animated into the squiggle....or.... 
stretch the line and then go to complex

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
