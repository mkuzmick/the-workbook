## garry's ideas from this [idea doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-H75NuO2Ln1-yp7R4m3FhmGE856WcEbwm4pXf0eSfpA/edit) :

* filming: wants to film with student at mfa exhibit and in classroom. 
    * can we film at mfa?? if not what are other options for simulating ethnographic observations?
    * can we get a lluf to stand in for a HS student? 

* wants base image to modelled after the student, then for this to happen:

and have a pedestal added like this one:

all of this to be 3D, not 2D. 
Full body instead of bust only if possible
wants to see the transition happening, not just separate images
