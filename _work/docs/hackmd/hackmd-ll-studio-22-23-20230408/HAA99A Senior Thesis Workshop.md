# HAA99A Senior Thesis Workshop

Digital Tools!
Cameras!
Visual Moves!


## digital tools
### installing the adobe creative suite
* [HUIT's step-by-step guide](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=6503754e47541190566cf147536d43f9)
* Download the desktop app
    * Sign in online with your Harvard account
    * Once you're signed in online, you can download the app
* Open the Adobe desktop app on your computer
* Sign in with your Harvard account again so that the desktop app knows that it's you
* You don't need to download every app! The desktop app allows you to choose which app you want to install

as students of art and architecture, we'll use photo manipulation apps like Lightroom Classic and Photoshop a lot! so let's download those.

If you're working with a massive number of images, Lightroom is great for organizing photo libraries. Photoshop is useful for editing one image at a time.

### lightroom classic (LRC)
* catalog: the images you're working on
* in bottom left, select "import"
    * then, you'll have the ability to choose a specific folder on your computer and bring those images in
* once you select "import", all of the images should show up in your catalog
* in the top-right, you'll see a histogram that shows you the color band of the photo (i.e., where the different pixels are)
* click into the Develop module (one of the headings in the top right of the screen)
    *  an editing challenge!
        *  figure out which of the six Rosetti paintings looks the best to you
        *  then try to make another one and make them match using the tools in the Develop module (these should appear in drop-down menus on the right-hand side)
    * temp: how warm or cool do you want the colors in the image to be
    * tint: magenta to green
    * exposure
    * contrast
    * saturation: the intensity of the color
    * watch the histogram as you change these things!
    * HSL/color zone: where you effect very specific colors; in the saturation tab within the HSL/Color zone, select the color you want to effect and bump them up; you can also click the sample tool (top right of this drop-down menu) and click on the image to effect the hues of anything you've selected in the image
* you can add keywords and ratings if you want to organize your photo library (in the "Library" module)

### photoshop 
as a photographer in museums, there are probably two things that effect you:
* keystoning: converging lines that distort an image 
* reflections in glass that you need to get rid of

it's really important to try and remove these things in camera! But there's a lot you can do to edit photos in Photoshop.

If you're in Lightroom: you can right-click on an image and select Edit in > Photoshop > Edit original (FYI this goes back to the original file to edit it)

in Photoshop
* left-hand side: different tools you can select that will change cursor into that tool and let you manipulate the image
* right-hand side: properties of things you have selected (or maybe the whole work)
* layers panel (bottom right): layers of adjustments that you stack on top of each other, building stacks of layers
* Create a duplicate layer by grabbing the layer and pulling it down onto the plus sign (bottom right corner)
    * now I have two layers!
    * why do this? because you can always go back to the original layer
* With top layer selected, select "Filter" > "camera raw filter"
    * brings up something that looks a lot like Lightroom!
    * in Geometry (right hand side): this is where you fix perspective distortion
        * far-right: an icon that looks like a hashtag, click this for "guided"; you'll draw two lines at are meant to be parallel and it'll make them parallel
        * select the sides of your frames around an artwork and the tops and bottoms of the frames and it should fix any keystoning/perspective distortions
* zoom in on your image to see if there's any reflection in glass (if you photographed something in a display case)
* spot healing brush tool (you might have to click and hold down on the tool that's about eight down on the left-hand side)
    * select this tool and draw over top of anything you think is a reflection or a spot that doesn't belong there and Ps will do its best to remove it
    * on the toolbar at the top: you can change the size of the brush by selecting the carrot next to the brush and dragging left to right (you can also do this with [left and right brackets]!!! this works in most Adobe programs)
* object selection tool: trace around an object and it should remove the background for you

## cameras

keystoning: a perspective distortion that makes it look like the lines on, say, a building are converging

to remove keystoning: make sure the angle of your camera is perfectly perpendicular to the object you're photographing!

## visual moves

graphic design principles
* contrast
* repetition
* alignment 
* proximity

how to balance text/image
* in academic papers, there's data (e.g., paintings)
* there's your analysis of that data
* probably don't want to have your analysis as text in the slide 
* try to avoid having a full paragraph you're reading out loud because it creates a duplication 

photographing objects
* might be useful to make orthographic views (top, side, bottom) of the object since a lot of us know how to read those views already
* could then produce a perspective of the object after you've presented the orthographic views
