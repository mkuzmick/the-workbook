### staff interactions with calendars


### Fellows interactions with the calendars
* All events will go on ll-plan, inviting, if relevant: people, the room calendar, and ll-shoots.
* At Monday standups, we will review and decide what to invite ll-menu to.
    * TBD: figure out if we want to add discreet holds on ll-menu for private things that we want people to know are vaguely happening (like a consultation is happening in the studio at this time but we don't want the name of it public)
* at project review meetings, we will invite ll-report-this to any events we want to report on.

Fellows and MPAs should add their working hours to their relevant calendars.
Fellows can subscribe to ll-menu if they'd like
* thought this may not be updated until the monday of that week?
Fellows can invite ll-report-this to events they'd like to report on (?)


## slack
all fellows get individual slack channels. these are private

there are also the public group slack channels (#ll-undergraduate-fellows and #ll-media-and-design-fellows) and public work sharing channels (the #show-your-.... and #save-your-....)

## google drive
Fellows will have individual google folders. this is another more private avenue for saving work. referenced into each individual MDF's google folder will be a read-only folder "MDF_Resources" (exact name TBD) with group docs like a handbook/syllabus. LLUFs will have this as well!

### Gdrive folder naming convention:
Jessi Stegall MDF 22-23
Charlie McNamara LLUF 22-23
Dan Bermudes MPA 22-23


## HackMD
* LL-23-23: for staff use, can be shared but not edited by others not in the workspace
* MDF
* LLUF

## bots

### do-your-work-bot

- key slash commands
    - `/action` allows you to add an action to the actions table, and you can view these in a kanban view in Airtable
    - `/resource` allows you to launch a resource-doc microproject
    - `/workshop` allows you to launch a workshop-planning doc or handout?
    - `/`
- db notes
    - metaprojects are known from the beginning, and can include courses, departments, etc.
    - projects need to be defined ASAP, and certainly by the time we schedule any media capture
    - each project will have a number of microprojects (taking between 2 and 20 hours, say) which can be of the following types
        - lookbooks
        - prototypes
        - example/model (or are these all prototypes?)
        - resources
        - workshops
        - media-capture
        - hackathons
        - capstone-events
        - documents of other sorts? (or are these all resources?)
        - research/learning/planning
        - office hours
        - open studio time
        - prep
