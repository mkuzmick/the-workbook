## the directions:
### for this build...
We need to create several builds of a looping MP4 file showing a 3D globe spinning. Here are the details for each build:

Build 1: Slowly spinning dark grey globe with white areas highlighting the following regions:
* ~~Ancient Babylonian
* Egypt~~
* Ancient China (including Mongolia)
*~~ New Zealand~~
* Southwestern USA (California)
* Peru
* Nigeria
* Polynesia
* Madagascar
* Alaska
* Congo
* India
* Bolivia
Build 2: Add a slowly spinning dark grey globe with a white area corresponding to the Fertile Crescent (source: https://www.thoughtco.com/fertile-crescent-117266)

Build 3: On this map, we should highlight the following areas:

* Germany
* UK
* Italy
* France

Build 4: Slowly spinning dark grey globe with white areas highlighting the following regions:

1. Start with a dark grey globe with no highlights.

2. Highlight the UK and the USA in white.
 
3. Slowly highlight all of Europe and Russia in white, one region at a time, including:

    * Scandinavia
    * Western Europe
    * Central Europe
    * Eastern Europe
    * Russia
4. Slowly highlight all other parts of the world, one region at a time, starting with regions that are geographically closer to Europe and ending with regions that are farther away.

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post (unless is is larger than a G - then find jk)
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!

I've found a way to make all the map highlights! and I have a spinning gray base map. Now I have to put them together in an animation.

Messaged LL Studio Slack Blender Files of all the necessary Globes for Emilio! 
Will start to render on Purple Mac in Classroom. 
Scratch that-- the transfer to the Purple Mac did not work. I will continue to render on my macbook air and cry a little bit each time. I'll upload to Slack with each render!

**What's Needed Next**--  

All globe animations have been rendered in Evee (low quality) and can be rendered in high quality later. 

4th globe animation needs to be put together in video editor in order.Files are named 4thGlobe# in order they are supposed to be animated together. 

Other globe animations are complete and in the Globe Animations folder.
