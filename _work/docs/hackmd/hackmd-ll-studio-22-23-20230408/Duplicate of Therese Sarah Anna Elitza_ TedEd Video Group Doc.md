# Duplicate of Therese Sarah Anna Elitza: TedEd Video Group Doc

### TedEd video on ancient authors

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhNw1BhV6sw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## What this medium allows
* play with media: visual, audio, text, animation of historical artifacts (question of aestheticization of history, modeling, etc.)
    * accessibility of ideas: animation
        * use of color and different visual modes can attract different types of learners 
        * almost a synaesthetic approach to learning: visual, text, and audio all included
    * play with visual motivation (timelines, movement)
 * can change scale as it goes (like with the moving timeline) as opposed to static image
 *  being able to show techniques (writing on clay tablets)
 *  different sizes of text to show importance (?) like putting Akkadian in big letters
     * It's nice when words are written on the screen, like showing how things are spelled! Sometimes it's hard for me to follow when it's just animation and reading aloud, having those cues with words help

## How this makes moves like an academic article or other academic object we're used to
  * showing our authority/source: TedEd logo but no animator/narrator self-presentation (distance of narrator)
  * really clear ideas of what is emphasized! It means we have a sense of things to pay attention to (like the dropping the bass on Serial, but with animation)
 * like some academic articles, it produces a big idea (of the world's first author) and then dives into specifics and content
 * ends with larger pull-out point/point to other materials etc.
## How this makes moves in a different way from an academic article
  * audience? I think we sometimes associate animation and slow speech with children-directed media
  * can change scale as it goes (like with the moving timeline) as opposed to static image
  * different sizes of text to show importance (?) like putting Akkadian in big letters
  * * unlike some academic articles, this sounds like a textbook--no explicit argument. this is explanatory, and maybe could be used by students to show grasp of large-scale "memorization" goals, but could be adapted to more explicitly state an argument. could also be used as a teaching tool re: media to try to unpack implicit arguments
## How do we find this aligns with goals? When would we ask a student to make something like this or learn with something like this?
* If there is a need for memorizing information, this provides a new way of associating that information with images. Useful for pure informational recall and making connections
* We might ask them to create something like this when we want them to practice synthesizing information and highlighting important aspects (what do you say, what do you animate)
* Good jumping off point for analysis of how a source works
* Could be good as an asynchronous presentation style

## Are there ways this doesn't align with goals?
 * question of tone: how do we know this is educational content?
 * having them actually make this would probably take so much time- would they then be focusing more on that than on the content, and are we okay with that?
     * there are lots of ways to scale down; pictures instead of animation, for example

## Notes
* initial ideas:
    
   
    * starts off with a quote from the subject of the video: playing with voice: is it the narrator voice, or enheduanna's? 
    
   
    
    
    
    * sound cues end of video
    * as opposed to the podcasts, there doesn't feel like there is much change in tone or sound here (I like the textbook comparison for this too)
