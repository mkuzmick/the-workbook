# 20230210 CLASSIC360 LL workshop plan

## plan

assignment ideas they’ve had
write these on cards 

and then - let’s look at one specific thing

talk through in more detail
imagine you’re in a class and student turns this in
is this a good assignment or bad assignment
what are the elements that work and dont
how would we grade or respond to that
how would you eval and what would the challenges of that be
what are the challenges for students
what’s better than an essay
worse than an essay

—

on way to capstone assignments, we work on scaffolding

in class activities you can do in section
week long response level things
that prep you for larger capstone assignment

drawing, etc.

with that - Sarah has a lot of experience thinking about assignments in language courses and she’s going to lead us through one!
### Draft outline:
* Unpacking activity (MK - 20 minutes)
* Drawing activity (Sarah - set up for 10 minutes, 10 minutes to make it)
* Students present (20 minutes)
    * Students can present with face filters if they want

### notes
* there could be a less activity based tour through different modality types (sample of a podcast, video essay, unpack what they’re good at doing, and then use that as a way of talking grading and commenting)
* Sarah interested in an activity that combines warm calling and presenting. They have a reading and introduce a concept to them. Draw out how you would communicate this information in visual form and then present with the overhead what it means etc. because she thinks its an activity that could go over well in section (in language courses, and gen eds)
    * MK- they draw out a way of teaching the information to students
