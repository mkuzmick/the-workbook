# HH Visual: Steven - Graph Refinement
## the ask:
recreate a couple of graphs in Ai as layers to animate more precisely in keynote

Tools: Illustrator



## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pspoPFbsB7u4I83VALc-OVBUIYG0xSrV)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MNjpGR-Po2YWkTizoUxwksG4BBTvzzZ0). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssZkSKPc2vXryuU9HJqLrinS9z9pzd-k/view?usp=sharing).


## the directions:
### for this build...
we want to recreate each of these graphs to be optimized for appearing on a black background. we need to create separate layers for each "element" of the graph and export them at 4x PNG with transparent background.

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
