### Notes from the Instructor:

* 20220911 From Kate - I was imagining that this Sept 19th meeting is an opportunity for me to get an introduction to your facilities. At the same time, my students are invited to visit the lab and get the same intro. This gives you an opportunity to pitch your idea of the students doing interviews across the semester and making a short video or reel of the experience.
However, if no students sign up (because its optional), then at least I got the introduction. And then I can go back to my class and pitch your idea of doing interviews at the beginning and end of the semester with the opportunity to create a short reel of the experience. At that point, individual students could make appointments to visit the lab.

DEBRIEF from 20220830 Con:
* Jessi will put together a mini lookbook - Draft of one time workshop intro LL
* She liked the idea of a media pool
* We can’t just do that without showing them how to do it. While they’re there - let’s do cool stuff with cameras
* How they might make use of the media capture pool, how they might add to it, how they might create a visual essay 
* This could be just one optional session
* The interview thing
