#### email reply:
Hi Dani,

Thanks for the reminder!

Regarding the previous podcasts, I have not been able to download them as files from Canvas. I wonder if I could try to add you to the previous course Canvas so you could have access to them. I could try adding you (or someone), and I would need your/their Harvard ID to do so.
