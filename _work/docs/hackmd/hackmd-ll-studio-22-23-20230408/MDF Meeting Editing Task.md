# MDF Meeting Editing Task

## Background
Media & Design Fellows meet every other Friday to share what they're working on. These meetings provide the LL staff with data about MDF projects--data we use in our reporting to departments and other university stakeholders at key points throughout the year.

### Project description
At their most recent meeting (20220930), MDFs presented at the main studio table, using camera 5 and two keys (filmed under the overhead at table 1) to do on-the-spot multimedia presentations about their current projects. Each MDF had a couple of minutes to quickly tell a story about their work.

### Ask
Create individual videos of each MDF presenting. These short videos will ideally show the two elements that were on the studio table: 
* the head-on shot of the MDF presenting
* the piece of media they MDF is projecting on the table using the key

It would be super cool if each MDF got a video version of what we all saw projected on the screens during the meeting (i.e., those two elements listed above, which were keyed on the main studio table).

## Elements

20220930.0.001_MDF.Biweekly.Meeting
 
## Tools
Video editing software :)

## Deliverable
Short videos for each MDF of their mini-presentation (one G-drive "MDF" folder is fine for all the videos)

## Timeline
As soon as possible but it's not super urgent either!
