### notes from the instructor

#### 20220912 Consultation notes from Dani - 
* First essay is a close essay comparative essay
So for workshop 1: talking about the things they normally talk about. Moving away from 5 paragraph framework from high school to how can we structure essays. Special focus on the comparison
* Sheza will share unit 1 prompt. Theyâ€™ll be working with 3 texts. They have to choose 2 and compare and contrast
* This week - Move from close reading to a potential argument. Moving beyond these are similarities and these are differences. And next week will be in the LL. refining the thesis, making sure its an argument that will develop over the course of the essay
