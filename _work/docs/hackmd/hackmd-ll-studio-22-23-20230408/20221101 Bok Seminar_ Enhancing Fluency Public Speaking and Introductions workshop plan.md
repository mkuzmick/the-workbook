Yesterday (20221025) in class they spoke about bringing emotions and feelings into introductions. Over the weekend they’ll do video introductions and then in the LL they’ll do live introductions. 

MK asked about the context of the introduction - a more intimate setting introduction or one that they’d give to be a big audience
* Sarah had been thinking more about on the stage delivery. Since they spend most of their time in the class in smaller intimate settings. So more public speaking would be good.
* Microphone will be cool! Makes it more theatrical and presentational

Sometimes we integrate it with something they’ve drawn or written - like a card. Can do in pairs or individually. They’re leading from point to point to point, trying to get us excited about why they matter. Not about memorizing, but responding in the moment
* Sarah said she would love that. They did 1 mini presentation earlier this year. One of the feedback most students got was about using the board effectively (they were describing objects but some didn’t bring the object in or even draw it)
    * So the impact of visuals and creating a more memorable experience.
    * Tour guide of giving us a tour of a conceptual or literal space


MK asked about structure of the intro, are the elements they should be including
Sarah said they have not moved to storytelling (they do that in the spring seminar) - this is really about fluency and not dropping jargon. So trying to pull out of depth to more simplified overviews. And including adjectives or enthusiasm (I am studying X or I am excited about doing this and why). Giving not just straight information/facts to enable a connection/ not just a boring list of what someone is doing.

3 undergrads will be here. Sarah told them its helpful if they have something in mind if we call on them to model something but they might not present. But can be there to give feedback, could join some of the pairs.


Flow:
* LL introduction
* Sarah’s students introduce themselves to the LL staff, write names on the card
* Then get them to create 2-3 cards/visuals they want to tie into their introduction
* Then they can present on stage, and we can film it. 
* Feedback from Sarah (+MK/LL staff - Sarah said good for them to get regular feedback from others that is no tjust about their being non-Native English speakers)
    * MK will have additional ideas of leveling up in the case of their being additional time
