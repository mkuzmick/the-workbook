    - 

## mk notes



- At the beginning, they’ll do a little pulse check in. then 4:40-4:50pm - Aysha wants to ask MK and Tina a couple of questions (so the group can see how the art of questioning plays a beautiful role in what they do, how they’ve come to embrace talking to people) they’re trying to broaden what they think research is.
- 
- mk reflectino and interviewing: MK asking about doing something that makes use of the idea of videotaping reflections- MK can speak from expertise about people reflecting on camera about the things they’ve made. (aysha said yes)
- If MK goes first, then tina will base the probing questions on. MK said could lead in an activity with a partner and their iphone, they try to ask a series of questions that will lead a good result and a good story. Not as though you’re selling out but you’re also learning. MK working frmo intuitions about creating interesting video projects, but tina could come in and beef up the interviewing questions part.
- many people one question
- questions over time to yield story
- on-cam
- beginning checkin
- 440-450 ask us questions around
- "art of questioning" plays a role in what we do
- how I've come to embrace talking to people
- stuff comes up in the process . . .
- (mk: how did this thing come into the world)
- exercise of developing probing questions
- mk: questions and interviews on camera
- same person, 3 Qs
- same Q, many people
- how did this thing come to be?
- prompts and AI
- being receptive as a listener
- you are standing in for the viewer
- i was a writing teacher, those are the Qs I learned about . . . transferable skill






### notes

Tina -
Questions play multiple roles in the work that people are doing.
Questions you want to ask yourself
Questions that help to frame a research question
Questions that you would ask directly to people that are participating
Tina could offer up a couple of protocols for finding and refining questions (not as an activity though)
And then lean more into the value of probing questions vs. clarifying questions + an activity
