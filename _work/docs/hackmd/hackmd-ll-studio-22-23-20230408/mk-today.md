# mk-today

20230406

## first

- floor animations
    - notes
    - My suggestions/requests would be:
        - so the more massive star (here red) should start out blue, but then it should expand and become red (like here). This is when it starts donating mass (but OK to not resolve that). The other blue star should actually stay round/circular (it is now being deflated/flattened). I actually discovered that this is a mistake in the video that we based this video on! [wow!]
        - then if possible, it would be great if the stars can go supernova, and then make the marbles, -> then the marbles spiral in (other gif). Not sure if this is something that can be done?
    - mk notes
        - two stars, one gets larger and red, then supernova . . . then both go supernova?
        - ...rewind then do again as marbles with a timeline?
            - blues orbit
            - one then other supernova to black
            - then black hole marbles orbiting each other until the collide and become one
            - then the bigger black hole drops and we follow it as it drops into a jar?
        - then this whole story going along a timeline
        - then this is 3d space-time-lines
        - then the factory (and maybe waffle)


- 9:15 meeting
