# :sparkles: jk-today :sparkles: 
* lluf hiring process - nudge forward
* HH LOOKBOOK review!!!!!!!! :exclamation: 
* submit andrew's rec letter
    

## lluf-stuff:
* create a [list of trainings](/bVlJeM4WSSyLkQ0OCDWAwg)
* hiring process design
* nominate student of the year
* develop shift sign up interface?
## make-work
* unity to switch 
    * get nintendo dev acct + fellows unity acct


## lluf-prompt/actions:

### for office hours:
 * bio-render 
 * unity scenes
 * create a really simple canva or hackMD based visual essay using gifs. make in hackMD and present in canva for extra.
     * ID 2-3 moves this video makes and get those as gifs and put in. like MK matrix one. or the [resource on video game fonts.](https://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/help/video-game-fonts-and-elements) 
 * [resources repo for reference](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources/blob/master/data/resources/help/video-game-fonts-and-elements.md) the reason md os good is bc we can parse it and put it inot websites, like our resources.xyz site. and also why all images we use need to be hosted somewhere and can't just be uploaded to canva ;)

in the AI/AR zone:
 * use studio@learninglab.xyz make sure we are set up on devices with development environment. ipad pro should be designated for whoever is in realityLab is has lidar baked into so we want to use it for ar experiments. we need to ensure we have a dev acct. determine what we call the company, etc. we will buy a headset when it comes out, but building for phones or ipad (ipad is only LL device we have) for now is good.

Ae:
* templates for social videos?
* higher end green screen work
* compositing of 3D and video (like metal LL with video, like intro sequences)

for east asian cinema:
* design a little learning activity for effects week. like designing exhibits at a science musem predict fun and informative that you canr eally pull off in those 10-15 minutes. bite sized interactions. we want that part of it to be more eveident for people. lookinf for a mechanic that works. 

determine the smallest unit of something that is cool and it becomes a grammar that can be expanded infitinely. like the wood and the pipe, printing film stills (you can do a milloin things with it)

unity unreal: work on the filters stuff (like the snap chat) do real time tracking, publish to snap and tiktok.

chatgpt web dev thing.

### less urgent:
 * AI inventory (a review of the tool)
----
notes:

* https://unity.com/solutions/nintendo-switch
* have we created a nintendo dev acct for ll?
    * should we do the org app or the indiv app? with indiv app, you run into some road blocks around dev experience potentially.
