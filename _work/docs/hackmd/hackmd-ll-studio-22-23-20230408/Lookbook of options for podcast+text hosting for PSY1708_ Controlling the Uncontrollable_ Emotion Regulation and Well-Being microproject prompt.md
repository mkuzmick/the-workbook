# Lookbook of options for podcast+text hosting for PSY1708: *Controlling the Uncontrollable? Emotion Regulation and Well-Being* microproject prompt

## Background
### Ask

#### notes from consultation
Jessica would like to be able to host podcasts in a gallery or something, sheâ€™s not sure how feasible it is. She would love introductory tool available to harvard students for hosting, if there was something that was easy for them to use that they could choose to host their podcast, and put written components below. Almost look like  a single page. If they wish they could share URL more broadly. She did not envision compiling and then posting somewhere.

She would like the option for easy sharing in class. If students opted in to sharing for their final review day, they could do that. But she is thinking longer term. How can students use these things to market themselves when applying for jobs. Just getting students to think about portfolio and hosting materials online and sharing that more easily with others, versus sending files. She was trying to think if this type of assignment would be an opening for that.
