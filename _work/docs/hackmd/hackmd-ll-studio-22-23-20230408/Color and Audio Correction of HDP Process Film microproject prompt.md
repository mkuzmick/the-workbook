# Color and Audio Correction of HDP Process Film microproject prompt

## Background
### Project description
For her work with TDM90DR in the Spring of 2022, Jessi created a 30-minute process film that makes visible the process of the HDP production in Spring 2022. This film will serve as a thorough archive for HDP, as well as a resource for future students to be better understand the nature and function of this course. Film Objectives include: documenting creative process of each choreographer

### Ask
"I've finished editing the HDP Process film for TDM90DR last semester, which is about 30 min. I have the FCPX project on my drive - I'd really love help with color correction and audio adjustments before I send it off as complete. Any chance Luke can help out with this? I'd really love to have it done by the end of next week, as I need the drive to continue editing the other HDP stuff."

## Elements
Jessi will give you her harddrive which contains the FCPX project. 

## Tools
FCPX

## Deliverable
The color and audio corrected film uploaded to the LL Vimeo (with captions eventually, though not needed for the viewing event on September 29).

## Timeline
* 9/14 - Request made on Wednesday, September 14
* 9/23 - Jessi would like the film to be finished
* 9/29 - Premiere Viewing Party in the LL
