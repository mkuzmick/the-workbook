### notes from zoom consultation

Ideally for their scheduling they want to do 2 sessions of 8 pieces each - they normally rehearse 10am-2pm for rehearsals every week day but then they also have their teaching on top of that

Ken asked about the teleprompter. MK said we could try that way
They’re all writing scripts and they’ll each be talking individually.
The performance is all four of them. Planning on doing all of the excerpts and do it one easy go and then do the speaking separately - to the camera.

Wide shot of all four + some close up shots of people playing
Talking after the fact

### past LL shoots

We've shot some string quartets and individual strings performers (and just plain old presenters) in the LL before. Here are some references.
