## 2D platformer

### steps (allure notes)

1. create new project (should they do this each time?) 
2. open tutorials (not just scene)

- for editor basics, zooming in and out, i was unable to zoom in and out but the tutorial thought I did (the instructions says hold down the alt or option key and the mouse button, then move the mouse to zoom in and out); will i need a mouse?

- learning how to move the enemy was confusing; once i placed the enemy in the scene I tried following the directions for that and was unable to, but unity still reacted as if i did and allowed me to move to the next spot 

- IDK if you want us to do the build and publish part: it takes up to 30 mins to do and the game would become public

- Overall really good tutorial and easy to follow except for small exceptions listed above (I liked it a lot!)

### allure notes karting 
- figuring out how to do the top speed step was confusing
- getting to the point to change the kart color was a bit confusing but i was still able to figure it out on my own (you gotta go through the folders)



### bea notes 2d

Editor Basics Step
-Random alerts
-Zooming in on trackpad is not allowed

Adding an enemy step
-Confusing to move the enemy

Building and publishing
-This is the last step

-Might take some extra time to build and publishing (mine got stuck for 30 minutes at 0% progress)

In total, it took me 20 minuntes without publishing to complete the tutorial. Overall the tutorial is adapted to begginers and is well explained except for a few steps (such as moving the enemy)

## bea notes karting

-Some of the tutorial indicators are a bit glitchy (i.e when indicating where the top speed is)

-I would tell students not to spend too much time playing or testing as that can be very time consuming

-The within the change colors step, selecting the KardBody game object is confusing. Users should go to the karting folder>Art>Materials>Kart_Classic>KartBody

-When changing colors or objects, tell students to use the preexisting colors instead of using the droplet tool (if they try to use the droplet tool they might have to change system preferences to allow for screen access from the game)


-Took 20 minutes to complete, many things are very similar in both tutorials, but I liked doing both to consolidate the concepts








### max notes
Finding Top Speed was confusing
It didn't point to "Base Stats" it just had a large box

Zoom in out was wierd, instructions not meant for mac (right click) **better with mouse**

Finding the kartbody could be better explained (which folders to go into)

For some reason my moving the camera keeps getting stuck (it's just that if you zoom in far it's difficult to move)
Instead of zooming in just select the thing you're trying to move

When it says go into play mode then feel free to make changes it doesn't let you make changes because it forces you to only hit the play button
COOL in general. like 30 minutes?

2d game is very good, I think it works better and is quicker (also maybe because I did it second?)


## Samara and Justin notes
In the first tutorial, it may be helpful to add the content of the "Explore the Game" tab to the "Enter Play Mode" tab. This gives the user an understanding of the game mechanics before pressing the play button. Having the gameplay countdown and start while the user is trying to read how to operate could be overwhelming.

It was difficult to find the "Top Speed" since the user was directed to a box which made it seem like Top Speed would be inside but the user actually had to click on "Base Stats" to find it.

Selecting Kartbody was confusing. It would be helpful to add more directions to help users navigate to the correct folder.

The user might better be able to find the "chang color" option if base map was highlighted or if the directions specify that you need to click base map to change the color.

When the directions indicate needing to look at the top of the screen it might be helpful to add a quick note such as "look to the top left of the screen" in addition to highlighting.


## Lily and Emmy notes
*doing tutorial without audio*

### 3D Tutorial

Get started 
- 5/8: cannot find the Top Speed property control
    - had to click into "Base Stats"
- we like that it highlights and only lets you edit the one parameter per step

Change colors 
- 4/8: not clear where the KartBody GameObject is
    - click into Karting > Art folder > Materials folder > Kart_Classic > KartBody
- If you go to a previous step you have to re-do it to continue on
- 8/8: said we could "play around" but it wouldnt let us select anything in tutorial mode

Add a Jump
- 2/7: cannot find JumpRamp Prefab
    - click into Assets > Karting > Prefabs > Props
- 4/7: Moving ramp is difficult

### 2D Tutorial
- No notes! Easy to follow


### Useful Shortcuts:
- F: focuses on the object you have selected
- W: move tool
- Alt or Option + right mouse: zoom in and out
- Cmd + s: save
- E: rotate
- R: scale
