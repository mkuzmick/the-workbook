## the goals

- for everyone to improve their Blender skills
- to develop this hackmd into a resource doc for Blender-learners
    - and to get better at that workflow
- to prototype a Blender workshop that involves all students creating the same object, features of which could include
    - a final celebratory moment that brings all the objects together 
        - in a Blender scene
        - in an AR experience for phones
        - in a VR experience for oculus
        - on a website in a simple image gallery
        - on a website with exports from orbiting cams
        - on a website with sketchfab embed
        - on a website with three.js
    - perfect pumpkin-to-button workflow
    - perfect pumpkin-to-insta/snap/tiktok filter workflow
        - moonshot here being a rigged 3d model, not just a static one
    - perfect drawing-to-system-to-svg-to-blender-to-pumpkin workflow & scripts
- to think up anything else we can that emerges from the activity
