# 20221003 HAA99A Senior Thesis Workshop 1 plan

**session 1:** capturing and manipulating images, micropresentations
**session 2:** developing presentations, visual essays

people: Dan, Marlon, Christine, Yue, & LLUFs: Caleb, Marcus, and Charlie


## plan for session 1

* introduction to the Learning Lab as a partner during this project
    * we can help you learn tools (get everyone started downloading Adobe CS if they want to--identify a LLUF to show how?)
    * and think about how to present things orally, visually . . . on the web, wherever (but we'll tackle this more during the second session)
    * ask what they want to get better at?
* today we'll focus mainly on capturing images, manipulating images, and on practicing a few of the "micro" maneuvers you might perform with images  


1. ll intro
    2. graphic design principles
    3. compare and contrast two shots of cards
    4. 
3. get Adobe installed
4. then learn about what lightroom and photoshop are for
5. sample work with the images from their presentations
    4. 
    5. smart object
    6. camera raw adjustments
    7. free transform
    8. adjustment layers
    9. curves
    10. color balance
    11. spot healing brush
    12. masks
    13. some of these in LR too
    14. 
6. cameras: capturing artworks and spaces in different ways
    - compare and contrast two views on table
    - then stations
        - doc style v overhead at main table
        - shallow d.o.f
        - large format
        - tilt shift
        - no keystoning with phone
        - Ps to remove perspective distortion
            - lens filter
            - cam raw filter
            - free transform
        - color balance, exposure and contrast
            - in cam
            - in ps or lr or fcpx
        - reflections?
            - spot healing brush
            - plexi-test
7. 

### rotation 1: photography?

* photography
    * with phones, learn to shoot art and architecture
*  how to process images for Art History
    * removing keystoning (perspective distortion)
    * white balance (and color more broadly)
    * exposure, histograms, contrast
*  advanced techniques and tools? 
    *    removing people from galleries?
    *    removing reflections from photos of objects under glass?
    * photogrammetry of 3D objects 
    * animation tools
    * maps?
* introduction to the “moves” of  multimodal (particularly visual) storytelling and argument
    * the students will have already done a presentation with some of their images prior to this session - so maybe include something about the fact that today is about refining/rehearsing
    * with images they have brought to the session, work on practicing an array of the sorts of “moves” they might need to perform in their theses (many of these can be saved for meeting 2)
    * comparing and contrasting two images
    * a beginning/middle/end triptych
    * a thesis/antithesis/Aufhebung triptych
    * a before/after diptych
    * isolating a detail
    * revealing a recurrent visual trope across an array of images
    * highlighting a geometrical, graphical or other structure within an image
    * integrating images and text
* at the end of the session, each student practices performing an impromptu introduction to their topic using one of the visual “micro-narratives” above in our Studio to offer “Act 1” of their theses (the motivating problem or puzzle, say).

## possible mechanics and stations

- a station on overhead vs c200 and macro to get at what this does to the artwork
- photo postcard? maybe get the students to take photos of themselves
- philosophical Qs about how much light is "right"
- 
- install the Adobe CS
- white balance and exposure
    - options on phones
    - options on cameras
    - fixing in ps or lr?
    - 
- keystoning
    - with phones
    - 4x5 or 8x10
    - tilt-shifts on c200s?
- compositing them into a building (maybe connected to keystoning? maybe this is where they present?)
- some sort of paper prototyping (sculptural or architectural?)
- avoiding reflections, but then removing them
- subject isolation in ps
- keystone fixing in ps and iphone
- instant alpha and separation from background
- graphic design principles
- incorporating video and audio
- storytelling component
- compare contrast shots
-

### notes from the instructor

* October 3 - introductory session, how to install creative cloud, basics of lightroom or photoshop with their own images would be great
