# ToolTime: Scoring a Podcast! (Logic X)

So you’ve finished recording your podcast—the audio is clear, consistent, and free from unwanted background noise—but somehow it still fells unfinished…

You may be in need of a music score.

Scoring is a great way to set the tone of your podcast and reinforce the emotion you want to convey to your listeners while also adding an entertaining element to your podcast. When creating the score for your podcast, keep in mind the topic at hand as well as the audience that will be listening in. 

## **Setting the Mood**

Scoring can have a monumental effect on the character of your podcast and there are various ways to set that desired mood.

### **Melody**

“Melody is to music what a scent is to the senses: it jogs our memory… It carries and radiates personality [ … ]. As such a powerful tool of communication, melody serves not only as protagonist in its own drama, but as messenger from the author to the audience.”
— Marcus Paus (2017)

For example, a slow and elongated melody will likely carry a somber or melancholic personality, while a quick and lively melody could be used to create an upbeat and excited mood.

Use your emotions and experiences as inspiration: Are there any songs or sounds that you enjoy that make you feel a specific emotion? Try playing out a melody that makes you feel a similar way.

Remember that music is a highly subjective art form and people might interpret the same melody in different ways. So do what feels right for you.

### **Harmony**

- **Major vs. Minor Chords**: Major chords are generally associated with a happy or upbeat mood, while minor chords are often associated with sadness, melancholy, or tension. To play a major chord, start by picking a root note—where the chord will start—and add the note four piano keys to the right as well as the note three piano keys above that. For example, if the root pitch you chose was C, you would now be playing C,E,G—E bing the major third and G the perfect fifth. You now have a C major chord. If you want to make this into a minor chord, lower the major third (E) by one step to have a minor third (Eb). Try creating a short chord sequence that creates a loop, also known as a chord progression.

- **Dissonance vs. Consonance**: Dissonant sounds are pitches that don’t quite fit into the chord. They create a sense of tension within the harmony that can be used to create a mood of uncertainty or discomfort. Consonant sounds are pitches that fit well in the chord and are more harmonious and pleasing to the ear, creating a sense of stability. Try adding in different notes or interesting sound effects from apple loops to your major or minor chords to see how it changes the mood. Don’t forget that these dissonant and consonant pitches can be applied within your melody!

### **Rhythm**

Rhythm is how music is divided within in a segment of music that holds a certain number of beats, known musically as a bar. A person's natural response to rhythm is to move to it, not only physically but emotionally as well. Below are two ways to reinforce a mood in your music using rhythm.

- **Tempo**: As the speed/tempo of a rhythm changes so does the perceived mood. A quick tempo can create both positive and negative energy, while slower tempos are calm or even foreboding. After you have a melody and harmony, try adjusting the tempo in either direction to see how it changes the way you feel.

- **Syncopation**: Syncopations are rhythms that don’t fall on the strong beats of a bar. They create a sense of anticipation, tension, emphasis, and excitement.

A great example of how both syncopation and tempo can change a mood is the difference between the standard Happy Birthday song and the Stevie Wonder version of the same song.

### **Orchestration**

Orchestration is how different sounds are combined in music. On top of setting a mood, using instruments from when and where your podcast's narrative takes place a can transport listeners there. Below are two more examples of how orchestration can be used to set a mood.

- For example, a ghost story podcast can easily be augmented by adding the tension of a high pitched string or similar instrument.

- For example, using classic synth sounds can be great for creating a sci-fi, techy, or 70s/80s mood. Think Stranger Things or The X-Files.

#### **Choosing and Exchanging Instruments**

**New Tracks**

**Existing Tracks**

This will give you a chance to flesh out your score with a simple sound before changing it to something different. To exchange an existing software instrument with another, click the intrument dropdown menu in the Channel Strip Inspector. This will keep all existing midi information for the track while changing the instrument being played. Try exchanging the sounds playing your melody and harmony with instruments you may have never thought to use to see how it changes the feeling of your music. If your music bed has drums, changing those sounds can also have a big impact on mood.</span> |

## **Where to Add Music**

**Intro/Outro**

- Intro/Outro music is the perfect opportunity to create brand recognition for your podcast.
- Ideally your intro music will be something catchy, making your podcast memorable.
- As an outro, music is a great way to conclude your podcast and even seamlessly connect to the next episode.

**Segment Divider**

- Useful for podcasts structured like stories.
- Punctuates key moments and transitions as you travel through the beginning, middle, and end of your podcast.
- Can be used to shift the moods of your podcast.

**Background Music**

- Should be minimal, acting as an ambience as to not distract from the speaker.
- Can be used to bring your audience deeper into the topic at hand. For example, if your topic is on the border tension between two countires, you may want to use music from one or both of those countries.
- Should act as a home for the narration, resulting in a cohesive listening experience. You likely won’t hear jolly music underneath a murder mystery podcast (unless it’s a winter holiday thriller).

While there are many places that you can add music within your podcast it's good to remember that omitting music from certain parts of your podcast can also have a big impact—emphasizing whatever is or isn’t being said at that time.
