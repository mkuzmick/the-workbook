# CE10 Workshop with the Learning Lab

Today we will go over the basic moves for creating your final video. There will be 3 phases of this workshop:

1. Story and Structure
    * During this phase, we used paper planning to structure our presentations with three cards or less. The goal was to make an impactful presentation describing our project/startup for a one minute video. 
2. Capture, Create, and Perform
    * During this phase, we learned how to and took video footage of our presentations to be edited later. This included using a camera, lighting, angles, the importance of taking multiple takes, and more. We also used Canva to create helpful graphics and animations to add to our final videos
3. Edit and Share
    * During this phase, we used video editing software such as Davinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere to import and edit all of the footage, graphics, and animations into a single working video. Finally, we learned how to export the finished video!
