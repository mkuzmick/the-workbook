## note 
causal sequence

timeline as the visual anchor.

pre and post BLM Ferguson - edit a montage of stills.

film action with screen, capture Steven in environment.

maybe lightning and clouds parting


## mk notes 20230203

- literature on prevalence of violent exposure
- "taking luck out of the equation"
    - mk: "is the best we can do? are we going to let this remain a matter of chance?"
    - "I argue we can do better"
- maybe video of steven as child . . . or pictures
- fortunately at harvard
- implicit bias 
    - people are used to hearing about the race based bias test
    - this is more about insider and outsiders, feeling like insiders
    - how much do they favor this new in group
    - less quick to establish trust
- can you start without the term "implicit bias"?
    - what about
        - 1: difficulty coming to trust, or coming to feel part of a group like a home or community or class
        - 2: in-group favoritism
        - 3: ironically 
    - we identify targets for intervention
        - in-group favoritism and mental health outcomes
    - maybe group of circles and a single circle
    - violence from in-group members especially problematic


## mk notes 20230210

- instead of straight arrow of causality from violence, something more complex
- we think luck, it's actually more complex
- children in group of people
- new circle
- have plot be a scatter plot of red and green
