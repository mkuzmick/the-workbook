Here's an example of a binary system evolution. This is just to give an idea of how these systems are animated:

### [Modeling binary star systems as factory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecinXgCA_eVF9Uj1NnvD2uOtCXnM0leC/view?usp=share_link). 
Modeling binary star systems is a powerful tool for understanding the complex processes that take place during the lives of stars. The concept is visualized as a factory, where different star pairs with varying masses and separations serve as inputs. The model calculates various stellar processes, including mass transfer and supernova explosions, to determine the outcome of the star system, such as a gravitational wave merger.

### The Visualization of Black Hole Discoveries: Past, Present, and Future Explosive Growth

Today's discoveries of black holes using conventional telescopes are merely a fraction of what will be discovered in the near future. With exponential growth on the horizon, the number of black holes we will uncover in the next 10 to 20 years or even decades will dwarf our current understanding. We are on the verge of an explosive growth in our knowledge of black holes.

## notes from session 1 (20230127):

needs a high level view of the expanding universe.

will send us slides for reference.

animation to explain visual concept of the parts you can observe and the part you have to puzzle out.

a visual sorting animation for the method- metaphorical--like a machine or factory with inputs and outputs. vary initial propertires (size, mass, distance) variations like in victoria's.

work on making things visually cohesive across the whole thing.

at least have 2 stars, and some version of of the timescale.


timeline . . .
- see one black hole in 1971, then a few more, up to 2015, then expand outwards to see the explosion
- sinusoid describes orbit of two masses
- signal and noise
- background noise
- game changing
