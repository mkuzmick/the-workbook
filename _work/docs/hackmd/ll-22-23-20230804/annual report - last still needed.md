## 1 photo:
to use for a paragraph about **Communication in Undergraduate Courses** with the following blurb:
* We worked with courses—ranging from French to Sociology to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology—that want students to move beyond conventional academic communication in order to intervene in the world politically or ethically, to educate the public, and to develop skills that will help them in their lives beyond Harvard. The Learning Lab partnered with faculty to support students in making podcasts, video essays, and oral presentations, among other forms, to achieve these goals.


ideally we would like to use photos of LLUFs so we don't need to ask for permission, but if students look good in a photo from a course visit, we can email to ask for permission.

## several more photos:
we have another page we need to fill! this could have a variety of LL photos, OR a few photos with some text on the labs from last year.
