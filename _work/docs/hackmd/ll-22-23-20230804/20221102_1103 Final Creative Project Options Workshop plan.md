### Anna's notes:
- it sounds like we either want 3-4 stations for all students to rotate through (like in the Soviet Film workshop), or we want to do some sort of elevator pitch setup where there are many options and students go where they're interested. I think this depends on how many of us can be there, but also on the students.
- Julie hasn't gotten back to me about the number of students, but it sounds like it won't be too many, which makes me think that maybe the setup should be not too many stations, and then we can decide in the moment if they rotate or if we pitch? if there are only a few students, we don't want them to have to rotate alone through things they have no interest in learning
