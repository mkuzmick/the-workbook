### Notes from the instructor:
#### Eleanor's message in respond to Dani's question below:
I don't think that there is a single set of tools that people will need, the proposals are pretty diverse. A lot of video and audio/podcast/interview plans, so if those are covered it will help a lot of people.

We also have several students thinking of making online displays of different kinds-- digital portals where the user/audience will click their way to different parts of the piece. 

Then a few whose work won't use LL tools per se (a painting, for example), but who still might benefit from hearing about others' processes.
#### Dani's message:
We’re looking forward to the Taste of Tools Workshop on the 25th! Let us know if it would be helpful to check in on a brief zoom call – our plan for now is to go over with students video editing and sound editing, but it would be helpful to either chat or email about the plan in more detail, ie. if there is specific software you want students to use, if/how students could bring in assets they want to assemble or work on, etc.

#### Notes from September consultation:
* Storytelling project- encourage students to do something in their own voice. Not a conventional academic essay. Engaging with multiple forms of media. Eleanor is open to podcasts, video, zine. Some students already have project/forms in mind.
* 1 workshop for september ([20220927 Multimedia Workshop Plan](https://hackmd.io/JvZXPt9xQIGsXtYljN3khA?both))
* this workshop on taste of video editing and sound editing, when they have stuff together they want to assemble.
