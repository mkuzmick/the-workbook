## reference
* [Project Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mcjSEhTMuWSHSL3B-MKhPQjaQqOsPHWA)
* [Anna's lookbook that was sent to Stephanie](https://hackmd.io/@annaivanov/HJ_ctDr3i)
* [20230310 consultation notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qt1kzdajpbJM9QGXqWEIbhjPGI6FfGfK7QAXJLJsiDA/edit)
## station ideas

* oral performance/live podcast
* scrollytelling/physical montage
* intellectural or forking 
* game
* drawing
* puppets
* computer generation/network stuff/chatgpt
* datavis
* infographic
* tableau vivant
* chord or mode
* video editing station (montage)
    * pre-populate stock footage that they can use
* giant head reading from the small studio
* film to text
    * poem about film
    * opportunity for students to translate eachother's work

so 5-6 micro stations (pair each station with 1 text)
and then 1 big station?

* 1 group could work in the small studio with the overhead, with it project
* 1 group could work at the main table and green screen



## random notes
Anna would like as it's happening, or as a wrap-up, to collect what everyone is doing and show it in a scrollytelling (and showing that you don't have to pick just one)

After the workshop, Anna will be providing consultations to each student on their final projects.

## media prep for workshop
### before the workshop
* workflow for getting stills / buttons
* workflow for printing the films as thumbnails
### during
* workflow for making gifs
* workflow for printing gestures
## draft outline of workshop
first 15-20 minutes: stephanie going over the clock

### mini stations
* Canva Video Station 
* reading aloud over the black and white poem in the small studio
* logic/piano station (Siriana)
* film strips station
* collage/physical materials + green screen
* camera station close reading
### then they have 20-30 minutes to work
* anna could make a prompt - 30 minutes to translate a poem in a multimodal way?
* one group using the small studio overhead?
* one group using the main table/green screen?
