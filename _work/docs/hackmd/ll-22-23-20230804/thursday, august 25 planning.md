        * when running project: things you want to run in the space - workshops, hackathons, course visits
        * get ahead on scheduling since it can get really busy!

* 9:20 - 9:40: scaffolding accessible activities
    * a bit of recap from DAS session
    * think about an accessibility exercise in small groups
        * in 5 minutes, do a micro-designLab at your table where you try to think of a few scaffolding activities that could revolve around alt text for images or descriptive text for something that's visual in nature
        * how could these be scaffolded in for the final assignment?
        

* 9:40 - 10:10: grading and commenting
    * grading a commenting/expos-y stuff (mk)
    * want to make sure that the work students are doing creating, say, a podcast feels as real as anything else they're asked to do so assessment really matters
    * think about what your learning objectives are and how you'd use those to assess student projects (and the type of language you would use to do that)
    * what would assessing a multimodal form look like
        * podcast handout
        * example of visual essay: (https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/506295430/6acef390d7)

10:15 - 10:25: break

10:30 - 11:00: celebrating student work

* putting all student work together to make something larger
    * book
    * gallery
    * portfolio
* what is its job? to celebrate? intervene in a community (like Mindich)? provide resource to other students or the world beyond the course?
    * could think in pairs about this 
    * or JK could talk about the reading she has
* what we've done (JK)
    * showcases
    * online galleries
* design challenge (this might roll over into 11 - 12 block)
    * mdfs design an event where student work would be celebrated
    * maybe they celebrate their own group work (or imagine that students have done the assignment and scaffolding they developed)
    * get them to be specific about it
        * think of a few mechanics (if film festival, what would you do? would there be tickets? a poster? how would it be organized?)

* 11 - 11:20: lookbook as a portfolio

do it live! I've got three HackMDs and I'm going to just copy and paste the text from them into my Christine's Lookbook Remix and I'll start making it my own.
* make a hackMD with their four assignment examples and the scaffolding activities they designed for them
* embed the screenshots from canva and/or embed the links


* CD maybe shows some reports to explain what it can look like to aggregate student work

* 11:45 - 12: let's start to think about labs!
learning projects about things you don't know how to do yet
what are the learning zones/labs? 

want to start thinking about a project or prototype they can build that we can show to faculty or show to a course
this is a good way to get to work in a zone
had a visual essay lab in the past where everyone made visual essays
reality lab for blender and unity 
scrollytelling and video essays
could be really specific - comic book spreads was a lab project last year 
next week you'll pitch your ideas but let's start thinking about the kind of learning project you'd be interested in

cluster of thoughts on the board at the end so we can start thinking about labs
listing out the forms they're really excited about
