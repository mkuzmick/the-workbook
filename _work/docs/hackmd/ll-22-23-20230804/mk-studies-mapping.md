    - 
map slice 42.40 to 42.36 and -71.16 to -71.09

ll is 42.3737166, -71.1205197

let's try 42.3737373, -71.1205050

42.3736846, -71.1203675 could be SW of it

42.3716258, -71.1205307 could be a touch north of it



1 second = 101 feet

= .000277777 degrees
.000022 degrees = the length of an ll table

back window of LL = 42.37369, -71.12047
 plus or minus .00001 = roughly a meter
