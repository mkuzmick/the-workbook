# Workshop Plan for PSY1018: Workshop on Scientific Communication

## Plan 
#### JK Ideas:
ok, so this might be too much to try without testing...but it's something we should for sure do with llufs to see if we want to incorporate it as a mechanic in future workshops!
**tournament style visual throw down jigsaw activity:** 
* 4 sections in the paper (intro, method, result, discussion) 16 groups given the article they've read. each section will be given to 4 groups. they have 10-15 minutes to develop a 1-2 minute oral-visual presentation on their section
* 4 groups of each section pair off and present to each other and then decides among themselves which one should proceed to the next step.
* the two remaining groups of each section present to each other and the entire section group decides which one proceeds
* the final four present in sequence at the main table
* we could incorporate a sort of The Voice mechanic too...where we have 4 staff/mdf "coaches" and each coach gets one group in each section-this way the competition could really be between the coaches and we could take the fall if anything fails terribly haha.

#### ok now maybe the real plan:
1. could do article-as-film-strip reassembly (how do images and text work together in a typical paper...and how might we play with that or remix it so that the text fits the image?) I say this, but the article has like one visual, so not sure we want to do this
2. show some models and do a close reading (like we did for mdfs with the vox video). maybe even just do the vox video? not sure-might want to find a more science-y one.
3. basics of sci-comm and graphic design
4. show the student model from last year...even just the bit that really demonstrates alignment and repitition.
5. students work in groups on producing a bite-sized visual presentation based on the paper they read.
6. students share their presentations

### Notes from the Instructor:

9/14 PSY1018
* MK Did this last semester, gave a workshop on scientific communication and then gave support to students throughout the semester. Ended up so much better with our support. 
* Final project - record a video. Challenge with this class now - has 36 students (some may drop, it’s over enrolled so won’t be more) 
* Still has resources on canva page from us
* Teach them about scientific communication and also about the resources they can access from the LL
* MK says for this workshop, we can do presentation in the main room but then could take different groups into different rooms so it’s not overwhelming

MK’s memory of what he’s done
* What he remembers - doing things on basics of communication, using graphic design principles, maybe unpack some examples of the form (infographics and diagrams, maybe showing them examples of videos from last year)
* In the past we’ve used a scientific paper that mayron has sent us and then they cut up visually
* MK asked if that would work in both


**note** we should show the students how to make videos themselves in canva or imovie, can be part of our workshop, we’re there as backup and you can come in for 15 minutes and record in the studio as a life performance. 
* We can do video editing office hours that can be offered to students.

from Mayron about the Video example in the project folder above - "I have Claire’s permission for the students to see it as well. That is available on canvas and on the syllabus, so most students have seen it already" 

#### more on video project recording details
For follow up - recording slots for larger class
Larger class is recording 4-5minute  videos individually.. 
Mayron said about half last year used the LL to record
MK said we could give time chunks to the TFs and they could schedule
MK suggested dedicating one section later in the course for recording and have backup times on top of that? (Mayron says this makes sense)
**note** we should show the students how to make videos themselves in canva or imovie, can be part of our workshop, we’re there as backup and you can come in for 15 minutes and record in the studio as a life performance.



 

### space and gear prep:

* print article in project folder above ( how many copies?)


### media prep:

* find a vox video that's on a more scientific topic to unpack
* get video file on the gold machine + key
* prep canva, imovie, small studio demo 
    * paper prototype
    * animated smiley faces in canva, for ex.
    * something in imovie - take the voiceover from the student video and put it on b-roll (someone hunched over listening to music, etc.)
