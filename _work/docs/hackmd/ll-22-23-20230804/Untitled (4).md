Before the 20th century
Date	Development
Antiquity	Greek myths of Hephaestus and Pygmalion incorporated the idea of intelligent automata (such as Talos) and artificial beings (such as Galatea and Pandora).[1]
Sacred mechanical statues built in Egypt and Greece were believed to be capable of wisdom and emotion. Hermes Trismegistus would write "they have sensus and spiritus ... by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it."
10th century BC	Yan Shi presented King Mu of Zhou with mechanical men which were capable of moving their bodies independently.[2]
384 BC–322 BC	Aristotle described the syllogism, a method of formal, mechanical thought and theory of knowledge in the Organon.[3][4]
3rd century BC	Ctesibius invents a mechanical water clock with an alarm. This was the first example of a feedback mechanism.[citation needed]
1st century	Hero of Alexandria created mechanical men and other automatons.[5] He produced what may have been "the world's first practical programmable machine:"[6] an automatic theatre.
260	Porphyry wrote Isagogê which categorized knowledge and logic.[7]
~800	Jabir ibn Hayyan developed the Arabic alchemical theory of Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the laboratory, up to and including human life.[8]
9th Century	The Banū Mūsā brothers created a programmable music automaton described in their Book of Ingenious Devices: a steam-driven flute controlled by a program represented by pins on a revolving cylinder.[9] This was "perhaps the first machine with a stored program."[6]
1206	Ismail al-Jazari created a programmable orchestra of mechanical human beings.[10]
1275	Ramon Llull, Mallorcan theologian, invents the Ars Magna, a tool for combining concepts mechanically based on an Arabic astrological tool, the Zairja. Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic truth and facts to produce advanced knowledge. The method would be developed further by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century.[11]
~1500	Paracelsus claimed to have created an artificial man out of magnetism, sperm and alchemy.[12]
~1580	Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life.[13]
Early 17th century	René Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines (but that mental phenomena are of a different "substance").[14]
1620	Francis Bacon developed empirical theory of knowledge and introduced inductive logic in his work Novum Organum, a play on Aristotle's title Organon.[15][16]
1623	Wilhelm Schickard drew a calculating clock on a letter to Kepler. This will be the first of five unsuccessful attempts at designing a direct entry calculating clock in the 17th century (including the designs of Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet).[17]
1641	Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan and presented a mechanical, combinatorial theory of cognition. He wrote "...for reason is nothing but reckoning".[18][19]
1642	Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator,[20] the first digital calculating machine.[21]
1672	Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved the earlier machines, making the Stepped Reckoner to do multiplication and division. He also invented the binary numeral system and envisioned a universal calculus of reasoning (alphabet of human thought) by which arguments could be decided mechanically. Leibniz worked on assigning a specific number to each and every object in the world, as a prelude to an algebraic solution to all possible problems.[22]
1676	Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz derived the chain rule.[23] This rule has become central for credit assignment in artificial neural networks: the backpropagation algorithm for deep learning is an efficient application of the chain rule to networks of differentiable nodes.[6]
1726	Jonathan Swift published Gulliver's Travels, which includes this description of the Engine, a machine on the island of Laputa: "a Project for improving speculative Knowledge by practical and mechanical Operations " by using this "Contrivance", "the most ignorant Person at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour, may write Books in Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks, and Theology, with the least Assistance from Genius or study."[24] The machine is a parody of Ars Magna, one of the inspirations of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz' mechanism.
1750	Julien Offray de La Mettrie published L'Homme Machine, which argued that human thought is strictly mechanical.[25]
1763	Thomas Bayes's work An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, published two years after his death, laid the foundations of Bayes' theorem.[citation needed]
1769	Wolfgang von Kempelen built and toured with his chess-playing automaton, The Turk, which Kempelen claimed could defeat human players.[26] The Turk was later shown to be a hoax, involving a human chess player.
1795-1805	The simplest kind of artificial neural network is the linear network. It has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.[27][28][29][6][30]
1800	Joseph Marie Jacquard created a programmable loom, based on earlier inventions by Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740).[31] Replaceable punched cards controlled sequences of operations in the process of manufacturing textiles. This may have been the first industrial software for commercial enterprises.[6]
1805	Adrien-Marie Legendre describes the "méthode des moindres carrés", known in English as the least squares method. The least squares method is used widely in data fitting.[32]
1818	Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus, a fictional consideration of the ethics of creating sentient beings.[33]
1822–1859	Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.[34]
1837	The mathematician Bernard Bolzano made the first modern attempt to formalize semantics.[35]
1854	George Boole set out to "investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed, to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a calculus", inventing Boolean algebra.[36]
1863	Samuel Butler suggested that Darwinian evolution also applies to machines, and speculates that they will one day become conscious and eventually supplant humanity.[37]

Date	Development
1910-1913	Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published Principia Mathematica, which revolutionized formal logic.
1912-1914	Leonardo Torres Quevedo built an automaton for chess endgames, El Ajedrecista. He was called "the 20th century's first AI pioneer."[6] In his Essays on Automatics (1913), Torres published speculation about thinking and automata and introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic.[38][39]
1923	Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) opened in London. This is the first use of the word "robot" in English.[40]
1920-1925	Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model (1925)[41] which can be viewed as the first artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of neuron-like threshold elements.[6] In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive.[42][6]
1920s and 1930s	Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) inspires Rudolf Carnap and the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle to use formal logic as the foundation of philosophy. However, Wittgenstein's later work in the 1940s demonstrates that context free symbolic logic is incoherent without human interpretation.
1931	Kurt Gödel encoded mathematical statements and proofs as integers, and showed that there are true theorems that are unprovable by any consistent theorem-proving machine. Thus "he identified fundamental limits of algorithmic theorem proving, computing, and any type of computation-based AI,"[6] laying foundations of theoretical computer science and AI theory.
1935	Alonzo Church extended Gödel's proof and showed that the decision problem of computer science does not have a general solution.[43] He developed the Lambda Calculus, which will eventually be fundamental to the theory of computer languages.
1936	Konrad Zuse filed his patent application for a program-controlled computer.[44]
1937	Alan Turing published "On Computable Numbers", which laid the foundations of the modern theory of computation by introducing the Turing machine, a physical interpretation of "computability". He used it to confirm Gödel by proving that the halting problem is undecidable.
1940	Edward Condon displayed Nimatron, a digital machine that played Nim perfectly.
1941	Konrad Zuse built the first working program-controlled general-purpose computer.[45]
1943	Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943), the first mathematical description of an artificial neural networks.[46]
Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener and Julian Bigelow coin the term "cybernetics". Wiener's popular book by that name published in 1948.
1945	Game theory which would prove invaluable in the progress of AI was introduced with the 1944 paper "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior" by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern.
Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think" (The Atlantic Monthly, July 1945) a prescient vision of the future in which computers assist humans in many activities.
1948	John von Neumann (quoted by E.T. Jaynes) in response to a comment at a lecture that it was impossible for a machine (at least ones created by humans) to think: "You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!". Von Neumann was presumably alluding to the Church–Turing thesis which states that any effective procedure can be simulated by a (generalized) computer.

1952–1962	Arthur Samuel (IBM) wrote the first game-playing program,[48] for checkers (draughts), to achieve sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. His first checkers-playing program was written in 1952, and in 1955 he created a version that learned to play.[49]
1956	The Dartmouth College summer AI conference is organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathan Rochester of IBM and Claude Shannon. McCarthy coins the term artificial intelligence for the conference.[50]
The first demonstration of the Logic Theorist (LT) written by Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert A. Simon (Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University or CMU). This is often called the first AI program, though Samuel's checkers program also has a strong claim. This program has been described as the first deliberately engineered to perform automated reasoning, and would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.[51]
Simon said that they had "solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind."[52] (This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call "Strong AI": that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do.)

1958	John McCarthy (Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT) invented the Lisp programming language.
Herbert Gelernter and Nathan Rochester (IBM) described a theorem prover in geometry that exploits a semantic model of the domain in the form of diagrams of "typical" cases.

Since humans are able to "see" the truth of such theorems, machines were deemed inferior.

Yorick Wilks (Stanford) developed the semantic coherence view of language called Preference Semantics, embodied in the first semantics-driven machine translation program, and the basis of many PhD dissertations since such as Bran Boguraev and David Carter at Cambridge.
First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) held at Stanford.
Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert publish Perceptrons, demonstrating previously unrecognized limits of this feed-forward two-layered structure. This book is considered by some to mark the beginning of the AI winter of the 1970s, a failure of confidence and funding for AI. However, by the time the book came out, methods for training multilayer perceptrons by deep learning were already known (Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa, 1965; Shun'ichi Amari, 1967).[6] Significant progress in the field continued (see below).

2020	2020 DeepSpeed is Microsoft's deep learning optimization library for PyTorch that runs T-NLG.[113]
In February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which was then the "largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters."[114]
OpenAI's GPT-3, a state-of-the-art autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce a variety of computer codes, poetry and other language tasks exceptionally similar, and almost indistinguishable from those written by humans. Its capacity was ten times greater than that of the T-NLG. It was introduced in May 2020,[115] and was in beta testing in June 2020.
2022	ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, debuts in November 2022. It is initially built on top of the GPT-3.5 large language model. While it gains considerable praise for the breadth of its knowledge base, deductive abilities, and the human-like fluidity of its natural language responses,[116][117] it also garners criticism for, among other things, its tendency to "hallucinate."[118][119], a phenomenon in which an AI responds with factually incorrect answers with high confidence. The release triggers widespread public discussion on artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society.[120][121]
2023	By January 2023, ChatGPT has more than 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date. [122]
OpenAI's GPT-4 model is released in March 2023 and is regarded as an impressive improvement over GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains many of the same problems of the earlier iteration.[123] Unlike previous iterations, GPT-4 is multimodal, allowing image input as well as text. GPT-4 is integrated into ChatGPT as a subscriber service. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile),[124] 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[125]
In response to ChatGPT, Google releases in a limited capacity its chatbot Google Bard, based on the LaMDA family of large language models, in March 2023.[126][127]
