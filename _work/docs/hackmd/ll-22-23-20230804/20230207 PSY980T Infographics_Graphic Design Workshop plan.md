# 20230207 PSY980T Infographics/Graphic Design Workshop plan

## plan
### Outline of a plan from check in
* Starting with an unpacking activity (ie. how to talk to your kids about covid? Rebecca can send if she thinks of any)
    * Less looking at the content, but more so looking at the form
* Then a few tips on basics of graphic design for this kind of communication of academic ideas
* Then low stakes activity that gets them to try it out - Maybe also something with paper prototypes, 
    * Let the students choose their own content/myth/idea (if you havenâ€™t landed on one, choose one from the paper) - could even look at one together and think through how to make a post about it
* Present to each other using the overhead (and also talk about rationale for form??)
    * Feedback from LL staff about form
    * Feedback from Rebecca about content


Each group responds as different users 
Social media - you're not just working with a single audience but a large and diverse audience
when you have this situation, you try to think of specific user stories - 3-4 very specific people you want to interact with your design and get something from that (a teacher in k-12 zone developing a unit for a health course; womgen course at a college; a 14 year old girl; someone who works in a state rep office)

graphic design creates continuity across posts - memes as an example of something where the meme gets applied in a new domain and this develops a kind of psychological shorthand
so think about branding/aesthetic - want people to recognize this as "myth" thing
continuity important because gives people a UI for grasping ideas

## space and gear prep
* 6 colored imacs - 2 on low table, 4 on high L table
* art spaces - main table, pipe table, and other side of low table
    * put out glue sticks, scissors, cards, large paper, markers, miscellaneous supplies etc. (avoid green paper )

* print 1 copy of the syllabus
