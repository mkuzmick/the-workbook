- printing project cards (MW)
- assets for May 10 (MK+DD?)
- system for collecting+displaying fellows work (MK+DD+MW)


### llufs

- bio-graphic wrap-up
    - for each we need
        - the raw video (.braw)
        - the initial .tiff exports (renamed with their names and a counter)
        - the transparent .png (original size and then also a resized-for-web version we can create once we have all the original sizes)
        - the .psd file or canva link to where they created their card
        - a .jpg export of their card (probably already in show-your-work)
- leveling up the bio-graphic prompt in two ways with AI
    - option 1: help Madeleine in [this base of AI tools](https://airtable.com/appwPyEPLPYVnz4ER/tblJEXShmQVgaUe6m/viwQUCuJ6vbf2DPIc?blocks=hide) by creating "bio-graphics" for individual AI tools according to [this template]()
    - option 2: use AI/ML tools as part of your workflow to create a composite of MANY LLUF bio-graphics. This could be 
        - a poster of four of you, like the original [Mad Men](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/514184482473534862/) 
        - or it could be that you ask ChatGPT to write a Python script that creates planes from all the .png images in a folder and randomizes a color overlay with a multiple blend mode to create something like [this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/514184482473546105/)
        - or it could be the about us page of a LLUF website
        - or it could involve midjourney-remixes or pairings
        - or it could be a group-project group generator that randomly deals a "hand" of 4 student cards to assemble a group randomly, etc etc etc.
    - the key is to use AI tools to try building something to get a sense of how useful they are to your workflow. Don't try to do something you know NOTHING about.
    - as always, we need to get all of your project files--you are welcome to share them all on Slack, or, if you are on an LL machine, you can save everything in the `/_projects/llufs/ai-bio-graphics` folder on the Synology
