# LL meta/projects



## for metaprojects so far we have:
LL_CODE
LL_INFRA
LL_LABS
LL_STUDIO
MDF
LLUF

## DD's proposed alternatives for metaprojects-
* ll_digital_infrastructure (google drive, slack, code?)
* ll_lluf
* ll_mdf
    * example of 1 project: MDF Fall Meetings
        * microproject is each specific meeting?
* ll_working_groups (toolTime + labs?)
    * projects: each lab, and toolTime
        * microprojects: each lab's microprojects (like 3d's mapping challenge) and each toolTime?
* ll_studio
