# ideas for TDM 1

# Learning Lab + TDM (mini menu)

Below are a number of tools, skills, and methods that the Learning Lab can offer in partnership with TDM courses. Many of these tools were prototyped with TDM90DR (Harvard Dance Project) in Spring 2022.


## Projections and Installations 


One of the ways in which we have brought student research and documentation into the digital space is by supplementing undergraduate performance projects with digital projections and lobby installations. These tools work to 1) enhance presentations/performances and 2) live as a sustainable record of work for students' portfolios as they transition into the professional sphere.

## Meta-cognitive reflective interviews
    
We have found documentary-style student interviews to be a fun and effective tool for meta-cognitively crystallizing learning objectives and encouraging students to reflect on their goals, progress, and learning in the course. By comparing beginnind and end of semester interviews, students are able to better understand the trajectory of their development (and it makes for great promotional footage, too!)

## Documenting from process to product
    
We use film-making to track the evolution of student research. Using film as a method of documentation, students can learn how to record their projects and create a professional-level archive of their work.

## Tablescapes
    


##  Web development / online portfolios
    
Helping students create online portfolios / webpages for their work can help them transition from university into professional work. By showcasing their cumulative efforts, portfolios offer valuable data about student improvement and skill mastery. Creating these portfolios in a digital space broaden the possibilities of how work can be documented, preserved, and shared, particularly for students whose work does not culminate in written form. 

    
##  Printed materials
    
We are also able to support the design, development, and production of printed materials, including buttons, booklets, zines, postcards, etc.

## Learning Lab Workshops
    
Any and all of the tools and methods we mentioned above can be delivered to students in both a hands-on, personally curated capacity, as well as through group workshops. Our dedicated workshops offer students insight and practice with any unfamiliar skills or tools that may be beneficial for the course assignments. 
    
Some of the workshops that we can offer thesis/capstone-based courses are:
    
- developing artist statements
- organizing portfolios
- filmed documentation of performance/presentation
