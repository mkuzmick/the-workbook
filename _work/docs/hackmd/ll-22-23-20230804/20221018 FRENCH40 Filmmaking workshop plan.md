#### 20221006 Notes from check in:

French40 Filmmaking–
CM has provided video clips in the past from the films the students have seen. As they walk in they see the video clips from the films they’ve seen and they get really excited. Some of the cool stuff - focusing on framing, focusing on the ways that students can start recording and have a filmmakers eye.

It’s an intermediate/advanced course - B1B2. course is focused on contemporary themes and issues - talk about immgiraiton, representation of minorities, education and access, ableism, lgbtq+ identity, etc. then they finish up the semester looking at documentaries and put up public displays of arts, renewing spaces and revisiting questions they talked about in class. As another layer - there’s the idea of framing. The final project is a movie, CM said the final projects are always above and beyond what is expected. Sound, angles, camera, lighting, etc. the recreation of the scenes is really helpful. 

Up close shots
working with lighting
creating your own scene that feels authentic (they’ve already started thinking about their own projects and their own ideas)

Phone as a professional tool. Some students went up to the atrium and they were able to test up there with stabilizers and other equipment. Making them feel comfortable that they’re capable of doing this. Placing themselves within the framework of being a viewer to being a narrator. They focus on narration and in this case they become the narrators - how do we best represent and present others on the screen and how do others manifest that on the screen and how to do that in French. So CM said whatever we think makes sense along these lines - and she’ll send us the video clips.

They can also speak in english for this workshop too!
