## Jinyoung
* video in lab
    * Similar shoot to the all the labs
    * also we'd like shots of the A/C he built. And maybe we want a better quality super high resolution perfectly framed shot that he can use to walk us through the process. Some other stuff can be some cool close ups and a little more abstract

## Lydia
(photos mostly?)
* Animation of dots representing people moving around and turning red as they bump into each other
    * aerial building outline, people bumping into each other and become infected - all in 2D each person a dot, as dots bump they turn redâ€¦.then have a burst of tiny particles from a person and people in vicinity get infected. then one infected dot goes into vestibule, particle emit, person leaves, uninfected person enters vestibule and becomes infected. then zoom out of aerial of one room to show that it is a part of many rooms. 


## Ryan
(keynote mostly?)
* causal sequences are the core of the talk
* text is ok - use 3 bullets of simple two-word titles
* person andhouse metaphor
    * person becomes more dotted outline
    * house fractures
    * at the end there is no house at all
    * a green outline like monopoly house outline. then house become red or dotted, shifts out and leave 
For next week try out the chalk outline morphing of:
* humainoid plus house (child and decaying house)
* venn diagram 
* stress to crp diagram starting with chalk outline and getting filled in with color as process goes
