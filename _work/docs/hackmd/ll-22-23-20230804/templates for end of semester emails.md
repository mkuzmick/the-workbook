# templates for end of semester emails

## courses we want to send the note to
maybe an airtable link? and identify which ones we'd want mdfs to send
## Draft for end of term wrap up:
*these might not only come from Dani. for MDF supported courses we will discuss.*

Subject: Exemplary student work
Hi _______,

It was fantastic supporting ______ last semester - please let us know if you’d like to meet up about any courses you might want our support on in the future.

Over the next few months, we’re reaching out to courses the Bok Learning Lab supported to begin to put together a gallery of exemplary student work on creative and multimodal projects. Would you be willing to identify 2-3 projects that you really loved, and let us know the students names and emails who made those projects? There's no urgent rush on this at all, but we'd like to reach out to them to see if they’re willing to give us permission to share their projects, and speak with us about some reflections they have about their work. 

Please let us know! 
All best,
Dani

### draft to nominated students who we have their projects

Subject: Request to share and reflect on your project
Hi _______,

We hope you're doing well! We're reaching out because you've been identified as having a really excellent ____ project by your instructor in ______ last semester.

The Learning Lab is working on putting together a gallery of exemplary student work on creative and multimodal projects. We want to ask your permission to include your project in the gallery:
* If you're willing to give us permission to do this, we'll just need you to sign a [super brief waiver](https://airtable.com/shrJlxSH4DvRYQRzb).
* If you're okay with us sharing your project, we would also like to extend you an invitation to sit with us for a brief 15 minute interview with a member of our team in which you'd have the chance articulate some of the ideas and decisions that lie behind your project (you could think of this as a director's commentary on your project!). If this sounds interesting to you, please let us know a few times that would work for you to come in (no urgent rush on this part).

Of course, let us know if you have any questions at all. We look forward to hearing from you!

All best,
Dani

## draft to students who want to interview
Subject: Scheduling a time to reflect on your project

Hi -

Thanks so much for your willingness to share and reflect on your project with the Learning Lab! Please [sign up for a time slot here to schedule a brief 15 minute interview](https://calendly.com/boklearninglab/student-project-gallery-interview) at the Learning Lab studio. (If you'd prefer to zoom instead, please reply via email and we can schedule a separate time for you.)

All best,
Dani



## WAIT ON THIS (maybe summer? maybe fall?) Draft for random student drop ins from courses we weren't in touch with

Hi _____,

We’re writing because we supported ______ in their creative capstone project this semester for _______ and we wanted to see if you’d be interested in consulting with us. 

At the Learning Lab, we collaborate with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. When ___ reached out to us, we were able to help them because we had extra availability, but if you’d like to meet up over zoom, we’d be thrilled to know if we can support more of your students. We often host a workshop (or a series of workshops) launching creative assignments and also host drop-in office hours for multimedia assignments. You can see a little more about what we do here: https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab 

Please let us know! 
All best,
Dani
