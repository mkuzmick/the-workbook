# Exemplary Student Work worfklow
## context
Over the next few months, we’re reaching out to courses the LL supported to begin to put together a gallery of exemplary student work on creative and multimodal projects. We've asked faculty we've supported to identify 2-3 students projects that they really loved. 

We're asking the identified students if they’d be willing to give us permission to share their projects, and speak with us about some reflections they have about their work.

## interview logistics
For students who've said they'll share their project and reflections with us, we'll need them to sign a [super brief waiver](https://airtable.com/shrJlxSH4DvRYQRzb).

We'd also love for you to record your conversations with the students as casual interviews in the LL! This will be good footage to have. Let Dani know and she can help get you booked. 

If coming in-person to the LL doesn't work, we recommend meeting via zoom so you can record as well.
## interview guidance
We trust you to have autonomy about the questions you ask! No script needed. Some themes that would be great to get them to speak about though include:

* What the process of making their project was like and what they feel like they learned about the course that was special because of this assignment
* Taking us on a tour on a few details/moments of their assignment that they're really proud of, or find particularly comment-worthy

## post interview steps
It would be awesome if you could:
* write down any notes that are interesting about the story

For now that's enough! As we move this project forward, we may reach out to you about getting your help writing a summary/short piece about the student reflection.
## feedback
We're super open and interested in feedback from you, the interviewer, as this all unfolds! Please do let us know!
