    * This was helpful for consolidating my knowledge on the scale of shots. I can imagine an in class assignment being more along the lines of watching a scene in a film and identifying the scale used in various shots and the effect of these, or the effect of combinations or progressions in scales of shot. 
* allure's chalk write up
    * Beginnings of the chalk board wall by Allure Akaeze. This is a project that creates a sense of belonging for faculty and staff, brings to light the various tools used at the lab, and helps further cultivate artistic and design skills that can be used  within and outside of the classroom (especially for me as an Art Film and Visual Studies Major)
* matilda's tiny desk ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F056DP74B3N/asset_2.png?pub_secret=2aaabe9958)I loved this task! I'm always getting more comfortable in illustrator and got to grips with using online downloads (brushes, fonts etc) in projects too!

    * I learned how to use Keynote and use primary source documents in an interesting and transformative way.
* caroline's globe ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0563LX2BR7/360_globe_360.gif?pub_secret=a15eade6b0)One really basic thing that I practiced with this project was essentially the scientific method, applied to Blender. Making this globe began with me asking questions and figuring out what I wanted to see as well as what Jordan and Adam wanted to see. Next, I tested a lot of different methods, aesthetics, colors, textures, and more to figure out what the best 'look' for the globe would be. That process of trying and revising multiple times was super valuable for me, and I'll use those skills in many projects to come. Another thing I learned was how to work with modifiers in Blender, and how to create a really complex material for an object.
