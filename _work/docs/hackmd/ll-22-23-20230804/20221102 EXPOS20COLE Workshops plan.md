# 20221102 EXPOS20COLE Workshops plan

## plan
Structure:
* Process of undertaking the creative project - look at models and unpack them, how does the machine work
    * apple commercial
    * rage against the machine
    * images of book covers, etc.
* Then figure out in a tool - how might I actually make that thing myself
    * 
* To wrap up - how will you rationalize the thing you made
    * why this form
    * what does it enable
    * why did you choose it
* If you want more technical help, here are the open studio times and our email address
