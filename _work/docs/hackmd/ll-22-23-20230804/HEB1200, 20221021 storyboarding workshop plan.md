### notes from the instructor: 
##### 20227 Consultation Notes from Dani - 

* 20221021: more focused on their specific project, storyboarding
each student will have a different topic and should already be working on their research paper. Some will have already led a class lecture on their topic. So they definitely should have a concept they can practice explaining.

* Week of 20221003-20221007: Final Planning Meeting with Bridget

* Weeks 7 & 8 (around October 14 and 21), likely right post lunch.

* From bridget - each student will have a different topic and should already be working on their research paper. Some will have already led a class lecture on their topic. So they definitely should have a concept they can practice explaining.
* For more context - Week 2&3 - they do activities in the natural history museum and talk to visitors to gauge what people generally know and don’t know.
* Technical things they used last time -
All of them used LL 2-camera set up. Almost all used card cut outs, talking to camera and moving things around on overhead. And came in for editing sessions. And used open access music. 
* MK asked if we should we spend time helping them make digital versions of the images they want to use?
Bridget said the things they’ll be using - Maps, photographs, artifacts (real ones at the museum and casts?) that could be recorded on broll

* MK asked - What differentiates the 2 sessions?
    * From her recollection, the first one was fun practice and being introduced to the LL. Second session just said storyboard and she can’t remember exactly what was done, she may have been out of town that week.
    * MK said the 1st one could be about the very idea of recording, getting comfortable with the overhead camera, explaining just a basic concept from course. The second session they think more specifically about their specific project. (bridget likes this strategy)
    * Bridget has an old storyboard template handout from us
