21st century teachers and scholars communicate their ideas in a wide array of media for a diverse array of audiences. When we think about honing our communication skills, we may think about improving public speaking or learning how to design better slides. In this course we’ll do this -- but we’ll also go further, training you in a diverse set of communication media, but also focusing on a key set of patterns and techniques for teaching and storytelling that hold true across the wide array of communication scenarios you encounter (from the classroom to the academic conference to the job interview). Each week we’ll engage a new medium, including voice, text, visuals, and the creative use of physical space. The goal of this seminar is to prepare you in as many media and for as many audiences as possible. You will work on two projects: a short multimedia composition and a short live performance.
