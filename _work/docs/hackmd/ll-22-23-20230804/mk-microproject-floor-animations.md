- blue star pair
- black hole chart
- black hole detection machine
- 

1. animation of stars orbiting. one expands. mass transfer. then one goes supernova. black hole pair collides.
    - particle stream may have to wait
    - initial sun, then encase in glass?
    - 
2. glasses full of marbles. add in neutron stars.
    - just get the right numbers and render
```
BH = black hole, NS= neutron star

in 2015: first BH-BH detection, eventually total of 3 BH-BH (i.e., 2 more)

by the end of 2017: seven more BH-BH (now total of 10 BH-BH), and first NS-NS  (so 11 =10+1 total detections)

in 2019-2020: 76 more BH-BH, now a total of 86 BH-BH in the catalog, 1 more NS-NS (now a total of 2 NS-NS in the catalog), 4 BH-NS!

future: 100 000 BH-BH per year, with a ratio of about 100:4:2 BH-BH, BH-NS, NS-NS this gives that for those 100 000 BH-BH, that there will be 4000 BH-NS and 1000 NS-NS (edited) 
```
3. two orbit each other, then collision, then one marble, then waves, moving left to right over warped grid
    - mainly grid
4. factory

### Floor

- start with the pivotal role in the history of our universe
- dinosaurs of our universe
- similar to how fossils of these massive stars formed, lived and died
- 10x or more massive than the sun
- 1 in a thousand
- forming two black holes
    - what if we could use these black hole colisions
    - gravitational wave paleontology
- ok--so how do we do this
    - so, when they collide, they release bursts of gravitational waves that can travel through space and 
    - 2015; 2017; more and more
- as an astronomer I map . . .
    - how do these systems form in the universe

need the stroopwafel algorithm.
- need the battleship analogue
- then the graph of the factor of 100
- massive size relative to the sun
- progress bar
