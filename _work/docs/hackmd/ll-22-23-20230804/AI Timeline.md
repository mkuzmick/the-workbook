2023 AI Timeline

February 1, 2023 - ChatGPT, also known as OpenAI GPT 3.5, was released, a language model capable of generating human-like text that could revolutionise the way we communicate with machines.

February 24, 2023 - Meta, previously known as Facebook, released Llama, a large language model with 65B parameters that's poised to shake up the competition.

March 13, 2023 - Researchers at Stanford trained Meta's open-sourced LLaMA 7B model using ChatGPT in under $600, demonstrating how easily and cheaply a LLM could deliver fantastic results. However, the experiment was quickly taken down after researchers noted that the AI hallucinated a lot, raising safety concerns.

March 14, 2023 - OpenAI released GPT 4, a significantly improved large language model compared to ChatGPT, currently only available to paid customers through their ChatGPT Plus program. The release raised concerns in the community that we may have inadvertently achieved Artificial General Intelligence.

March 14, 2023 - Google announced their intention to integrate generative AI models for image and text into their Workspace product suite, which almost got missed by most of the media due to the noise from OpenAI's announcement.

March 15, 2023 - Mid-Journey V5 was released, making significant improvements in the quality of images produced by this AI system.

March 16, 2023 - Microsoft introduced Copilot 365, envisioning a future where AI is deeply integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite, helping users generate documents, Excel charts, and entire PowerPoint slides with ease.

March 21, 2023 - Nvidia announced Picasso - Cloud Services for Creating Large Language and Visual Models, aimed at larger enterprises eager to jump on the AI bandwagon. Companies like Adobe and Getty Images have already partnered with Nvidia to power their next-gen AI-enabled products.

March 23, 2023 - OpenAI launched Plugins for GPT, allowing the GPT to connect to third-party services via API to extend its capabilities beyond just the GPT chatbot.

March 30, 2023 - AutoGPT by Toran Bruce Richards became the top trending repository on GitHub shortly after its release. This AI system is capable of executing responses to prompts to accomplish a task, creating and revising its prompts in response to new information without the need for human input. Its developers claim that it can write and improve its own code, allowing it to "recursively debug, develop, and self-improve."

April 9, 2023 - Hot on the heels of AutoGPT, a new Open-source project called AgentGPT is launched. Similar to AutoGPT, but running in your browser, it leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT to spin up multiple agents to plan and execute complex tasks. You can read more about it here.

April 13, 2023 - AWS announced Bedrock, a new service that makes Fundamental AI Models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon accessible via an API, making it the quickest way for customers to build and scale generative AI-based applications.

May 10th 2023 - Google had its Google I/O window which had a big focus on AI. Amongst the many announcements, Google released Bard to the public (its ChatGPT competitor with the ability to browse the Internet), along with announcing its bigger Palm2 Large Language Model. They also told us about their plans for their next generation LLM, Gemini, which is being built from the ground up to be multimodal. On a more utilitarian level, they also announced Help me Write which will be integrated into Google Workspace and Gmail to help users write faster within their work context. This comes hot on the heels of Microsoft's announcement of CoPilot, a similar product integrated into their Office 365 suite.

May 12th 2023 - Anthropic which earlier in March released Claude (a ChatGPT like Chatbot), announced that its AI language model now has the ability to analyse an entire book's worth of material in under a minute. This new ability comes from expanding Claude's context window to 100,000 tokens, or about 75,000 words, which compares very favourably to ChatGPT's 8,000 tokens.

May 13th 2023 - Hot on the heels of Google I/O, OpenAI announced that they will open up Web Browsing capabilities for ChatGPT along with Plugins to its Plus subscribers. And we didn't have to wait long, as I had access to these features progressively over the week of 15th -19th May.
