#### 20221006 Notes from check in: 
French 30:
3 stations they rotated between last year. JK asked if there are any changes CM wants

French30 course
They do a podcasting project throughout the term as a way to express themselves. They’ve done one and CM likes that they do it without any training. Then they come to the LL - it’s reflective for them to think about where they’ve been. CM a big fan of reflective learning. Right now, they’re thinking about how it went recording their first podcast episode and what they’d like to do better etc. CM thought the stations provided a lot of momentum for students, she really liked the set up and format. She really loved the projection of voice activity and that helps them in the long run. Background: french30 - meant for students who may have different levels of french background but wants to improve and feel more comfortable speaking the language. Goal to feel supported and have fun. She remembers them learning a little bit with the software - suggested students pulling up them previous submissions on the canvas site so they can rework. She guesses that some students have used some of the tools already, how to make it more professional, how to think about environmental factors, how to think about sound quality. She loved the idea of the small studio(?) - reminding them that podcasts don’t have to be just audio. (They will be the ones coming into french40 normally in the next term)

JK asks if CM recommends a specific software - CM said she uses our recommendations.
Jordan said we tend to use GarageBand and she thinks that’s what Casey used at the station last year. 

JK asked what compromises the first podcast they did.
CM said it depended on the student. Some students used music, some just recorded. The second podcast is the one they do after they meet with us, and then they compare the first and the second.

(CM is the course head and is not teaching this term)

JK asked if they’ve been listening to podcasts/any models etc. CM said they’ve been using a website TV5Monde that give them little snippets of French. Students are at B1 level.

CM said 3 stations are an awesome idea. Anything that can get them engaged and exciting. Getting the students comfortable with the stuff, we don’t have to speak french

Therese will be around to help with French30
