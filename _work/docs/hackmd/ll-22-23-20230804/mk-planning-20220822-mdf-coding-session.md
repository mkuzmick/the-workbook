## Thoughts on the Session

- all of these apps involve a database backend and an interactive front-end (think YouTube or Pinterest or Spotify)
- and your teaching kindof does this too
    - there's a collection of stuff you analyze (texts, materials, animals, events, people)
    - and each of these has a bunch of properties
    - and many of the various objects in your collections will relate to each other somehow
    - and then you come up with 
        - interesting relationships between these objects
        - novel arguments or observations about their properties 
        - argue about the effects the objects or properties have
        - detect patterns, etc
    - and in teaching
        - you give students views of objects in these collections (rarely if EVERY giving them access to ALL of the objects in a given collection)
