### notes from the instructor
* MK response - pitch activity could be helpful for anyone. More of a show and tell for **Dec2** maybe? Jason was excited - said every student would need to pitch their capstone projects so working that out/practicing/developing would be good. They haven’t selected dates for the pitches yet but it would be after the first week in december.
    * different forms pitches take, how pitches function
    * micro ted talks
* Jason asked if smaller hackathons could be scheduled in the spring for a smaller group of students who were all interested in the same thing (like podcasts), MK suggested evenings and ordering food.
* From Jason-Ed (or Med) school used to do a thing - Educationmatters series - videos of exceptional students talking about their work.
    *  **If there were some pitches Dec 2 that really stood out, to try and capture in some way would be good for department and program**
    * MK said we’d record the whole session Dec 2nd, the live thing would function as a rought draft and if any were great that they wanted to use live they could. But we could also set aside studio time in January for folks they’d ask to record for use
    * can also set up protocol for them to record themselves, as a sort of self-produced social media type of thing.
        * Jason said a lot of students would really be excited about this.
    * They’re also thinking about building up their own ability to be online and be in space. Get dynamic stuff for instagram. How to get content they might have on tiktok or stuff like that. So Jason is also thinking about opportunities for these things. The other program in their department, don’t have super dynamic stuff but they do have excellent photographs that really goes a long way.



#### Email from Jason, received 12/1:
Hi Carol,
 
Here is what we are looking for by 12/16:
 
The capstone project pitch is the first formal step toward the capstone, which is the culmination of your master's degree in media, medicine, and health. Approval of your pitch is required to assign your mentor and advance to the capstone course.

By December 16 at midnight, each student will upload a filmed pitch for the directors to review. The pitch will be no more than 5 minutes. Each student will also submit a 250-500 word paper.

A successful pitch will answer the following questions:

What specific health problem do you wish to address?

What storytelling method will you use to address it?

Why is this problem important and what is at stake?

How have other health initiatives and interventions sought to address this problem?

Why would your media approach be transformative?

How do you propose to carry out your media project in the spring?

A successful written pitch (250-500 words) will provide:

A preliminary description of your topic, and why it is significant;

A brief description of the social context of your topic;

A brief description of other health initiatives and interventions that sought or seek to address this problem, and why your approach is different;

A brief description of any other media initiatives to address this problem, and why your approach is different;

Why you believe your media project would be transformative;

Your plan for your media project for the spring semester.

Your written pitch should also include an annotated bibliography and include:

Minimum 5 different references, which can be drawn from any of your courses or your independent research.

Citations must conform to either the AMA or Chicago Manual of Style.

Citations must follow university academic integrity guidelines.

Your annotated bibliography should follow this format:
·         Full name of source
·         What type of source each is
·         Why you chose it (i.e., why do you think this specific piece of literature is appropriate?) What questions do you intend to use the source to answer?
Example of a source for your annotated bibliography:
Alexander, Michelle. The New Jim Crow. New York: The New Press, 2012. Book. This book is important to my paper because it describes racial discrimination in the justice system and provides statistics on the disproportionate incarceration of African American men. As my thesis is that mass incarceration is a public health issue, this book helps me argue that these health impacts will affect one group of Americans more than any other.
