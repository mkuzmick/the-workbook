Hi!

We're holding a small End of Year Celebration for our Learning Lab graduate fellows this Thursday, May 11. We know it's last minute, so of course no pressure at all, but if you'd like to join us for an informal happy hour 5-6pm at 50 Church St, Suite 374, we'd love to see you! 

All best,
The Learning Lab team

I hope your term is wrapping up well otherwise!
