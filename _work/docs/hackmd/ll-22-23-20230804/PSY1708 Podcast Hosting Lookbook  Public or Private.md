# PSY1708 Podcast Hosting Lookbook <img src=https://i.imgur.com/vf6Wk3y.jpg> Public or Private
There are **two** primary methods for hosting your recording:
1.    Hosting your audio recording on a **Private** cloud-based service such as [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
2.    Hosting your audio using a **Public** hosting site such as [Anchor(Free)](https://anchor.fm/) or [Podbean(Free&Paid)](https://www.podbean.com/)

**Pros & Cons**
There are benefits to both methods, but it really depends on your use case. 

* If you are looking to upload your recording primarily for academic usage, and would rather have the option to share it privately, then using Google Drive or Dropbox would be the better option. This also gives you the flexibility of uploading a text summary with your recording that can be placed in the same folder. However, one of the downsides is that embedding a public-facing recording into a website can be a little bit difficult. It also doesn't lend itself well to promoting your podcast professionally. 
* However, if you want to share your recording publicly then Anchor or Podbean can be great resources. Both services let you upload your podcast to all the major streaming directories (**ex. Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, etc..**). These services also allow you to submit a very short written summary of the podcast that will show up in the description of the podcast. 
    * Additionally, these services also let you embed your podcasts into other websites, giving you a lot of flexibility when it comes to sharing your work publicly. The only significant downside would be if you want a private option, this is very public-facing and wouldn't be a good option for that use case. 


### A Potential Third Option
 This is sort of a hybrid option between the two primary methods I mentioned earlier.

* **[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)** is a free hosting service primarily aimed at Musicians and Artists, but you can definitely upload Podcasts there as well.
    * What's great about SoundCloud is that you can upload your recording with a written description, and keep the upload private. This allows you to share the podcast with a private link, similar to how Google Drive or Dropbox would handle this. Additionally, you can embed this private link into a website allowing it to be semi-public, but still private to the discoverability of SoundCloud and the internet.

**Which Service Should I Use?**

The biggest factor in deciding what program to use is going to be the question of Public or Private. Once this decision is made, it will be a lot easier to figure out the best course of action. 
* Having used all of these options in the past, with the exception of Podbean, I can say that each service is relatively easy to use, with Anchor and Soundcloud being the easiest upfront. 
    * **Anchor** has a lot more built-in functionality, with tools to help you produce your podcast, and would be my top choice for professionally publishing a podcast. 
    * **SoundCloud** however might be the best hybrid option between all the different services. The fact that you can upload a private recording and embed that into a separate website isn't something that should be overlooked. 
    * While I haven't personally used **Podbean**, one major pro is the site gives you a fully customizable personal website on which you can host your podcast. This is a great option if you don't want to build a separate website for your podcasts. 

Either way, these options should provide some guidance as to what service is best for your particular needs.
