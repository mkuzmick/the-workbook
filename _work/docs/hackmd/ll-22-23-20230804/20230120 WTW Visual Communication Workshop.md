# 20230120 WTW Visual Communication Workshop

## plan

currently 19 registered.

MDFs around to help:
* Anna
* Carly
* Elitza
* Kevin

Many of the things we need to explain as teachers are best explained visually.  Sometimes the data that we are analyzing is itself visual (a Frida Kahlo painting, C. elegans anatomy); sometimes we find it useful to visualize something that is actually quite abstract in order to render it more concrete to students (a process, a hierarchy, a dataset).  


How to teach visually
* why visualize?
    * schema construction
* look at examples and unpack
    * [hans rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)
    * [jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fk1V5NqoD4)
* Mayer article jigsaw activity
    * each group gets a section
    * paraphrase and share out
    * this is about organizing content, let's think about organizing structures that are visual
* graphic design principles
* illustrate a concept in your discipline - what do you know you need to teach this term? or in your field?
* ending reflection: if you had students do this, what's valuable about that
* evaluation (leave 5 mins for this!)



Session Closing. Please leave 5 minutes at the end of your session to wrap up and direct students to fill out the evaluation form. The link is here: tinyurl.com/BokWorkshopEval and we will also have QR codes up around the office. Donâ€™t forget to share resources and ways for the students to learn more, remind them about relevant seminars, or encourage them to come back to see us in the future.
