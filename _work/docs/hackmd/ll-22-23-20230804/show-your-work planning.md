# show-your-work planning


## plan

- input
    - send a message **including an image file** to `#ll-show-your-work`
    - any further comments beyond the text in the initial post should happen in a thread attached to image
    - the bot logs this as a "show" 
        - and creates markdown for the image?
        - adds the image to images too?
- follow-up-in-slack
    - for messages posted by users other than ll-studio log user
    - for messages posted by ll-studio (and actually still listen to emojis on things posted by users) the image gets emojied with personal emoji and that defines the user
    - add authorization here later (for specific emojis)
    - for now focus on tool tags and user tags
    - more information added how?
        - maybe do this manually for now to see what more information we end up needing that we may try to systematize later
- processing (for now in airtable? or on server?)
    - connect to projects, tools, events, tasks
    - ensure X number of essential fields before displaying
        - add ShowYourImages and ShowYourWorks and all the fields from [old base](https://airtable.com/appXOcPzK7Qvb1Vam/tbl2wM6PlTj0kHTZj/viwM0yWaX29hhu4ta?blocks=hide) tags, reactions,
            - emojis can link to tags (but don't have to)
- display
    - print
    - timeline
    - `#best-in-show` channel


## notes from weekly doc
* make everyone do it? (or encourage? :)
* connect to task printing? (see above front-desk)
* learn-to-do-your-work
    * more pop-up tool-tutorials?
    * mechanics for this?

## initial prototypes

- MW printing by hand in Show Your Work and/or Images
- recipe card layout one page size, with ingredients section being the structured data, and then a paragraph or two of description

## needs and use cases and feature requests

- CD would like the timelines of MDF shows available
- CD needs updated media for reporting out to departments
- MW needs for showcasing greatest hits at the front desk/ front hallway?


## thoughts and reflections

### hackmds vs long-text cells

- we want to give MDFs and others space for long reflections
- but we also want to have to more uniform, shorter descriptions for all projects fitting a certain class.
