### mk plan

- split do-your-work base in 2:
    - project-base
    - action-base or prompt-base or to-do base
        - 


## To do:
* dani work with individual people on the staff to help make 1 base that helps them
    * task base (DD+JK+CC)
    * capture & deliver bases (DD+CC)
    * events base (DD+MK)
    * projects base (DD+MK)
    * show your work gallery base(s) 
* do an inventory of bases we have now and move some to archive
    * list them all out and go through side by side to move to archive
