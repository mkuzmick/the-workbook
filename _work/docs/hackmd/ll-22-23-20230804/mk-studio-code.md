## hyperdecks

`nc ip.ip.ip.ip 9993`
`remote: enable: true â†µ`
`record`
`stop`
`play`
`clips get`

```
playrange set: in: 00:00:16:00 out: 00:00:21:00
play: speed:50
```

note: set `timecode output: clip`



### sample workflow

- record (while NOT routing the feed from the hyperdeck to the TV)
- stop, play . . . switch so TV gets audio from hyperdeck (but nowhere else)


### instant replay concept

- two hypers
    - hyper.a
    - hyper.b
- initially
    - hyper.a receives PGM1
    - hyper.b dormant
- request for replay hits
    - hyper.b starts
    - hyper.a stops
    - hyper.a queues to timecode requested
    - atem switches to hyper.a playback audio ONLY
        - pan to one side?
    - atem sends audio at this point (mix minus?)
    - hyper.a play (with speed requested)
    - atem switches to display hyper.a on PGM1
    - somehow audio hits speakers and condensers are cut
    -

## to do

### macros

looking like this may be the only way to access cameras . . . also a good way to access everything else.

#### determine macro upload/download structure
do the first and then the second:

```
public async downloadMacro(index: number): Promise<Buffer> {
    return this.dataTransferManager.downloadMacro(index)
}
public async uploadMacro(index: number, name: string, data: Buffer): Promise<void> {
    return this.dataTransferManager.uploadMacro(index, data, name)
}

```

#### can you restore with code?

is there a method for restoring the ATEM based on an XML?
