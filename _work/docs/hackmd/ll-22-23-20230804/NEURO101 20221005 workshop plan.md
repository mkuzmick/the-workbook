# NEURO101 20221005 workshop plan

## plan
* Discuss how effective visual content can increase audience understanding/convey concepts in a different way than written content
* Looking at a model of a scientific article (Emily will pick a favorite!)
    * Example article from Emily's lab that has nice figures https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0150
        * Consistency in colors across figures- same colors always mean the same thing
        * Simple drawings of biological structures/organisms that broad audience might be unfamiliar with to orient to the data and serve as reminder of what technical terms mean
        * Clean plots with lots of white space, clear axes so easier to see the data
   * Example article showing ways in which the kind of data in the paper we're talking about today can be represented (recommended by Emily's psych PhD student roommate) https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2795626#.YzYLEQP7YnU.twitter
    * Article with tips for making image-based figures https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001161
* Article with tips for making figures (particularly interested in rule 3 since talking about adapting papers for presentations) https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833
* Steve Jobs + graphic design principles
* Prototyping a slide using paper visuals: the frame is your slides, you only have so much space
* Students each take a section of the assigned paper and come up with a 1 minute visual interpretation of the data that they present to the group
    * Students utilize paper and other crafting materials around the room
* After each presentation, discuss ways in which the visuals were successful/helpful in explaining the content


Additional challenge: Presentation is dynamic - you animate it by adding the pieces in yourself/with your partner as you present

Practice it in small groups (and could try it out with prof. walking through the different sections)


### timing
5-7 minutes for students to arrive and get settled
15 minutes for discussion of the big ideas of the workshop at the beginning + steve jobs video unpacking
5 minutes for graphic design discussion
20-30 minutes for students to create/plan their visuals
15 minutes for students to present their work at overhead camera
5 minutes for Alen to sum things up
=75 minutes total

## space and gear prep
paper frames and art supplies on each table
4 copies of the article Alen sent (in Project Folder)

## media prep
ability to play a video/show images from the yellow mac (projection screen?)
four up with cams 1-4 (these projected on the screens as well)
PA and stage mics
stage key (key 2) for students to present in middle of the four frames and/or for prof. to synthesize/respond to their visuals at the end

## live event support
live stills and buttons of students presenting or working at tables would be amazing! it's a small class (eight students so it would be really cool if each got a button)
