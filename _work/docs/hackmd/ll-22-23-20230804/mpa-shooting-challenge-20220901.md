# mpa-shooting-challenge-20220901

- starting today, we want to record at least SOMETHING at the main table each day, so we want the system on first thing in the am
- power everything on
    - main rack on
    - all monitors in brick room on
    - stage lights on
    - main table power strip on
    - second table power strip on
    - small studio power strip on
    - all screens and projectors on
- settings for all machines
    - sync the 8K ATEM (and ultimately others?)
        - confirm that the system is getting the right TC on the cameras
    - white balance everything. if not using scopes then
        - 4350 or so in zones with mixed CFLs and fluorescents
        - 4500-5500 in zones with more true daylight mixed in
    - shift tint and hue for cameras that allow it
        - most need 15++ on tint
        - hue spun to 182-185 sometimes helps if there's a green/yellow cast you just can't get rid of
    - gain and aperture
        - this is what you're going to determine today
        - see below
    - shot lengths
