## Some Forms


## The Elements of a Podcast
We'd love to start by taking some time to deconstruct just the first bit of a podcast, and unpack all the elements involved. We will do a close reading (or close listening!) of the first 30 seconds of a podcast called [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) and map out how the different audio elements work together temporally.

## Video Essays

Video essays deploy visuals, audio, and sometimes text in order to make an argument or convey key data to an audience. Let's unpack the start of a video together and think about its moves, much in the same way that we just did with the podcast episode.

Some great examples of video essays include these Now This videos [about Title 42](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1512891348218699778) and [border and climate politics](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1513246186546683905), as well as the Vox "explainer"-style video below about a chair featured on multiple album covers.
