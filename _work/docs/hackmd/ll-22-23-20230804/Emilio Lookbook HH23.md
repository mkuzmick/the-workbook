### notes from 20230210

- ancient hydraulic models
- molding from clay
    - can we model the clay?
- controlling the flows of water: understanding the human bodies in terms of flows
- a healthy body was one in which things were flowing well
- we do not jump from one model to the next, but we move gradually
    - mk: think about the da vinci overlay as way of developing a mechanic for doing this
- video of Emilio with the books
- at some point the mechanical becomes hegemonic
- funny version of Garry's suggestion:
    - that houdini demo with body bouncing and releasing the clay, gears, and digital networks he was asking for :)
    - look at Galison book on epistemic virtues

## notes from 20230213

possible timeline
* travel through space and time to focus on 3-4 main movements
* minimalistic timeline moving backwards and forwards
    * starts in present day
* photorealistic globe spins backwards and stops at first movement
    * ancient mesopotamia
* minimalistic timeline moves a little and globe stops at the following movements
    * next era TBD (ancient egypt?)
    * then 17th C Europe
* zoom into globe to show textures/technologies of the place/era
    * find stock footage of textures and materials (ex. clay)
    * hydromechanical machines
* last move, world spins and timeline advances back to today

video animation of existing collages
* could incorporate other videos - something similar to Youtuber who uses primative tools instead of modern technology
