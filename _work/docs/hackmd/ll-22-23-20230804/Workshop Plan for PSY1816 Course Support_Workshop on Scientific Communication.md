### Notes from the Instructor:
9/19: PSY1816 - 16 students (capped, possible some may drop)
* Same as last year. Support to develop infographics. 
* Definitely wants a hackathon towards the end of the semester for scalar support.

MK’s memory of what he’s done
* What he remembers - doing things on basics of communication, using graphic design principles, maybe unpack some examples of the form (infographics and diagrams)
* In the past we’ve used a scientific paper that mayron has sent us and then they cut up visually
* MK asked if that would work in both
* for scalar hackathon, we should reach out to ATG about helping with this hackathon- 12/7 (we can reach out closer to pin down the actual time) maybe we could send out a survey to students to see what works for them. And we can touch base with mayron end of november about this.



### space and gear prep:



### media prep:
4 up and key 2

### step by step:
unpack infographics as a group
graphic design principles
duarte exercise with article prof sent
look for words that provide a way of visualizing a structure (e.g., framework, taxonomy)
ask prof whether they should visualize beginning or end
then have prof synthesize the four ups at the end


## elements
assets llufs can make:
live trace or pen tool etude - all duarte objects and vectorize-get it as vector artwork, organize, print with line width that matches button size.
