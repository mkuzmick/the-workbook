## Physical

* Empty out everything except the steel pipes from the Glass Studio, move them into the classroom(or in their storage location) **JC/DAD** 
    * if the item has a box, or storage location, stow them there(cables, cameras, etc)
* Remove and coil any extra cables in the Control Room, put any devices that aren't actively connected to anything into the classroom **JC/SC/DB** 
    * the idea here is to clear the floor and the table tops of anything except computers
* Clear everything out of the Editing suite, except for the Macs currently in use and the furniture. **SC/JC/DB** 
    * again, put anything back in their requisite locations otherwise into the classroom

## Visual projects

[Harvard Horizons(TED talks for grad students)](https://gsas.harvard.edu/academics/professional-development/harvard-horizons) is coming up -- we tend to make quite a few visual resources for them. 

In January, we'll be pitching them ideas for projects, so this is a good opportunity for using interesting tools(Blender, C4d, After Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc). 

Below are some good options to make "on-spec" projects -- and for convenience, here's the reference sheet from over the summer: [on-spec projects](https://hackmd.io/YzXbMQNfTae1MFEzk1O2ug?both)
