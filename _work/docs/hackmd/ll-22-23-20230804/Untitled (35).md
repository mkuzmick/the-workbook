<p><img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F0485TUPX37/screen_recording_2022-10-26_at_4.27.29_pm.gif?pub_secret=58b47af9e6" alt=""></p>
<p>Go to the &#39;File&#39; menu, choose &#39;Bounce&#39; and then &#39;Project or Section...&#39;. Under &#39;Destination&#39;, check off an audio format: PCM and/or MP3. PCM (AIFF, WAV) will bounce a full quality file, while MP3 will bounce a slightly lower quality but more manageable file size. You can share your audio on sites like SoundCloud, services like iTunes, or create an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed of your own, so listeners can find and subscribe to your podcast.</p>
