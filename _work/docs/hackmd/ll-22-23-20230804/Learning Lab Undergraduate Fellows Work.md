## Skill Building


### 2D Animated Chart
By Caleb Lee

I think something like this could be used to enhance presentations in a way that adds more effect to something like a donut chart. Rather than a still image of a donut chart, something like this with a beginning, middle, and end (with the reveal of the final percentages) creates more suspense and impact for representing especially meaningful statistics. Otherwise, I think that it simply makes presentations more interesting, and adds movement in a way that doesn't make presentations dull and flow better with something like an adjacent lecture. 

Before making this graph, I didn't know the first thing about Adobe After Effects. This project taught me about creating keyframes, creating movement, and playing with multiple layers to create a single image. I can definitely see myself using something like this to enhance my presentations in the future, but more importantly applying what I learned in making this donut graph to creating different animations that I could use in my films in the future. 

I would really like to work on something like this in the future, where we are challenged to create different ways of representing the same things in Adobe After Effects. A donut chart could also easily be turned into a pie chart, and similar animations could be used to create a spinning wheel of something like a car. I like the idea of working together with a group to use the same principals of an animation created through Adobe After Effects to create different things, and I think with extra support from Marlon or others well versed in After Effects, we could create some really cool things. 


### 3D Animated Globe

I made this globe for Adam's Harvard Horizons presentation on military mock villages in the United States and around the world. The globe itself is constructed in Blender, and the glowing dots, which indicate the locations of military mock villages, is a Photoshop overlay. This multi-media project was a big challenge for me that involved many iterations and many learning opportunities. I learned a lot about modifications in Blender, using image textures, and animation to create the globe. 

One really basic thing that I practiced with this project was essentially the scientific method, applied to Blender. Making this globe began with me asking questions and figuring out what I wanted to see as well as what Jordan and Adam wanted to see. Next, I tested a lot of different methods, aesthetics, colors, textures, and more to figure out what the best 'look' for the globe would be. That process of trying and revising multiple times was super valuable for me, and I'll use those skills in many projects to come. Another thing I learned was how to work with modifiers in Blender, and how to create a really complex material for an object.

### Code for Studio 

### Graphic Design in Adobe Illustrator
By Matilda Marcus

/Imagine: the logo for the wildly popular NPR Tiny Desk concerts, but for the music department's senior thesis colloquium.

I loved this task! I'm always getting more comfortable in illustrator and got to grips with using online downloads (brushes, fonts etc) in projects too!  

I think that making a cover for something -- especially something that you're really proud of -- is a great way to get invested in your work.


### Visual Essays in Keynote
By Max Jepsen

A videoessay based upon the content from my Prison Abolition class, based specifically on one historical event at Walpole prison in 1973.

I learned how to use Keynote and use primary source documents in an interesting and transformative way.

### live event support 
### senior thesis support

   At the Learning Lab, we have the amazing opportunity to help undergraduates pursuing projects outside of the bounds of traditional pedagogical culture. This year, this role expanded to include helping out with seniors' creative theses like Shirley Chen (a former LLUF)'s play which incorporated archival research from Chinatown in Los Angeles, California. To assist, we (under the supervision of Jessie and Shirley) hung up hundreds of newspaper clippings, hanging tulle, helped turn old Chinese attire into three dimensional models, and brainstormed curatorial layout changes. 
   
   This task was really helpful in learning about curation and novel ways of physically presenting information. I would love to work on a project like this in one my courses, but am also aware of the immense amount of effort it takes to construct such a cohesive and impactful display. 
   
   Curating a physical space offers an amazing opportunity to engage with learners in an accessible way (sometimes not available through digital or academic means).
