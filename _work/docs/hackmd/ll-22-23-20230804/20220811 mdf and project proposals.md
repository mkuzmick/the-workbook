# 20220811 mdf and project proposals

lookbooks will have r

day 1: you're going to do a number of projects throughout the course of the year. by end of these 2 weeks, we're going to help you create a lookbook with assignment ideas and rationales for why they work in your discipline.
over time, they'd be submitting work in progress to slack. over time, we'd be helping them assemble that.


they'll use:
private for work remained confidential and what's shared
* individual mdf channel
* google drive
    * delivery and storage of large media assets is a good place to do that
    * if its not images or text (because those are handled well by slack) - like video files, blender assets


need to produce/report on information that will be public
* show-your-work, models, links
* google drive
* hackMD


they'll need images
text they've written



proposal part-
actually we want a project description and project report at the end of it.
more proposing a lab or learning project that its the LL who is greenlighting.

we want the project at a glance - the thing they'd send the professor who doesn't want to see 

me and CD - create a hackMD template for this lookbook project 

this doc is in google - and we just do googledoc2markdown and paste in our base
the other is that they get presented with an airtable or slackform that we know they're gonna create MD from and they paste in the description


we want this permission to use it and your help telling the story of it.

templates in google drive and forms in the other places (visual of the production pipeline, some people can skip to making things public)

google drive - project 1 working doc with the things to fill out
once you have a finalized description, we want to plug that into the project.

project 0: lookbook
project 1: name
we could have notes under the headings for what things are shared on each form
ex) description (when ready, click here to submit to airtable or something) and a professors email would never be made public 



## google drive folders
* top level name
    * working docs
        * project 0
        * project 1
        * project 2
    * shared with department docs
        * plan for the year
    * media
    * MDF RESOURCES (shared with everyone)


project 0: lookbook
project 1: name
project 2: 
we could have notes under the headings for what things are shared on each form
ex) description (when ready, click here to submit to airtable or something) and a professors email would never be made public 


things that we want to get can have spots on the google doc and at certain moments we're going to ask that you share public parts of this

and then we'll generate 'project at a glance's that are on the web

### for working doc template:
course/client
description
links + references + models
events and milestones
notes and reflection (throughout)

project 1 lookbook and we fill out the description
project 2 empty 




channels for posting things

"show" means that it is exposed to the public/published, so you put stuff there when you're ready for everyone to see them
"share" is still internal to us, our bok community


show-your-work



share-your-ideas
- text and references
share-your-moments
- image stream



ll-staff
save-your-links
save-your-assets
save-your-fcpxml
