This is their capstone project - audio/visual component of it. Going to be producing content that is for a very different audience than what you’ve been used to. And it’s a different platform. Could be with the intention of being on social media or could have a more targeted audience (like HUHS)

An overview on:
Talk through the merits of using a different format. How do we think about writing in these varying formats. What does it mean for the type of content that we’re putting out there.
Sheza has already begun to incorporate MK’s language into the capstone.

The topics:
* Looking at mindfulness from a variety of angles. They’re going to be working in groups. Could translate things from the research paper into this project, or could pick a new topic. As long as it’s related to mindfulness. 
* A lot of them are athletes, so a lot of sports interest
* One poet
* Different philosophies (Buddhist, Daoist, yogic, etc.)
* Forest bathing
* Chess
* Diving 

Could be a series of short things that add up to something. 5-7 minutes depending on how many people are in that group. Still needs a cohesive element because it’s a group project that explains that connections.

How to write for a newer set of platforms. What it means to produce content that is open to the public or for a specific type of audience. How would they curate their content accordingly.

Sheza will send us [capstone instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bh6HcIUs66sSP_EiJlxk8PZIvMiRh6hJ/edit) to print out. But MK can go over the rationale for them. And then get them to make something! Try to make one little 30 second to 1 minute piece of content that could involve music, speaking, visual dimension.

From sheza: Part of the purpose is to introduce them to the technology. Give them a mini project to work on so they can get their hands dirty.
Sheza said it’d be great for their projects to be grounded in what they’ve learned in class but she’s kept it pretty vague, and just related to mindfulness. Could be more along the lines of personal reflection.

What would be the rhetorical purpose of these things?
political or ethical intervention, persuading to change
Tell stories of self - textured articulation of your own practice and its meaningfulness
straight informative/explainers - drawing on their research projects
How to videos - ie. “how to incorporate mindfulness as a harvard student”/”how to be mindful at harvard”

Sheza said it would be great to tell them about these options ^ that could be possibilities for them
