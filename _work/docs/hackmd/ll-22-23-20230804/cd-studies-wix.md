# cd-studies-wix

## features i would want for project reports
* ability to click images from a gallery view that take you to a blog post about the project (nested pages of some kind)
* sidebar that allows you to see project names that you could click instead of the images
* wall text kind of view that has course, department info (like where medium and year would go in a museum!)

## notes
* text wrap only works when applied to a specific image (so, you can't insert an image after writing text and have that wrap around the image)
