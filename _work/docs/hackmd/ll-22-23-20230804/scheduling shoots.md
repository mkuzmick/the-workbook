# scheduling shoots

## what we ask of them (from help.learninglab.xyz)
* what course and project you're emailing about
* duration of the appointment you want to make*
* which space you want to book
* how many people will be coming with you
* 3 date/time options

*Typically, we book 20 minutes to an hour for recordings. This is to make sure we have time for the many students who need our studio space but also so students don’t have so so much extra footage to sift through which makes the editing process more difficult! Students are encouraged to prep and practice during office hours so that shouldn’t take place during your scheduled recording time.

Then look out for an email response from learninglab@fas.harvard.edu!

## process
* check to see if we've promised ['student project recording' support](https://airtable.com/app2Q5werGGNgVOiE/tblFwwhFMhuRQqWO3/viwmTOWvWJ92DB6mG?blocks=hide) for the course the student is writing about
    * if it's not a course we've already promised recording support to already but we decide to say yes, let DD know so we can add it to the projects base
* often, we'll need to email with clarifying questions


## booking space
### space options
* talk to DD&CC&SC as much as needed!
* review what else is happening that day that might need the studios, check in with workshop leaders as needed
* places to start for bookings:
    * video recordings in small studio
    * podcasts 
        * busy times
            * 1-2 students: casey's office 
            * 3-4 students: music studio or fireplace room
        * less busy times
            * small studio, fireplace room, or music studio
### steps
#### if we send time options
* make a calendar event "hold for [COURSE NAME AND #: (Podcast/Video) Student Recording: (name of student)]" *if* we send time options
    * book on: ll-plan
    * invite ll-menu, ll-media-plan, the room calendar
    * do not invite the student until confirmed!
#### once a time is confirmed time
* on ll-plan, remove the word "hold" from the event title
* make sure ll-menu, ll-media-plan, the room calendar are invited
* invite the student now
* include directions to the LL in the description field

Hi (name),
 
Thanks so much for submitting request to record for (course)! Can you please let me know the following before I schedule your recording time:
* how much time you’ll need to record
* how many people will be recording with you
 
Typically, we book (20-30 minutes for podcast recordings)(20 minutes to an hour for video recordings). This is to make sure we have time for the many students who need our studio space but also so students don’t have so much extra footage to sift through while editing which makes the editing process more difficult! 

We encourage you to come to our drop-in office hours (Mondays through Thursdays 3-5pm and Fridays 9am-5pm) where you can prep and practice prior to your recording time slot, and then after your recording slot you can receive help editing.

All best,

Hi ____,

Thanks so much for submitting request to record for GENED1112. The Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with and we haven’t been in touch with GENED1112. If you can give us some more information about your video project, any relevant information and support you need, and any deadlines, we’ll let you know if we can book you time to record.

If we are able to schedule you time to record, I’ll also need to know the following:
how much time you’ll need to record*
how many people will be recording with you
 
*Typically, we book 20minutes to an hour at most for student project recordings. This is to make sure we have time for the many students who need our studio space but also so students don’t have so much extra footage to sift through while editing! Students are encouraged to prep and practice during office hours so that shouldn’t take place during your scheduled recording time.
 
Please let us know!

All best,
Dani
