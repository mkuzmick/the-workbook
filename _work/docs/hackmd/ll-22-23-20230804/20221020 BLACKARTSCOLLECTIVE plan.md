### notes from the instructor: 

#### notes from consultation: 
MK said it would be fun to design it with Mariah and whoever she wanted to bring in. MK proposed having a meeting in the physical space to design the event and plan it. Brainstorming about the technical requirements or does mariah know them now? From Mariah:
Logic
They were thinking about having people work on their own laptops on garageband

MK said we have 10 iMacs that will have Logic loaded
Mariah said people from the LL to give the Logic instructions.
MK said we’d love to be able to capture it and report on it, if they’d want to use though on their own social media

Mariah said yes yes- they’d want video definitely for their platforms (and our own)

Thursday, October 20th, 7-9pm

MK proposed meeting up for an hour in our space. 6 of them can meet with us
