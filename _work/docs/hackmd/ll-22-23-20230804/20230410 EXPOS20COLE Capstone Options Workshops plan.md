### notes from the instructor
I think running the session like last time with the stations you described below makes sense. The way I’ve framed it to the students is that we’ll be exploring options for audio, visual, and multimedia projects in the Lab and then the following session I’m going to give them some orientation on creative writing options in the classroom. As far as media goes, the only thing I was going to ask during our call was whether you would want some of the capstones from last semester? I can also just send that to the students independently.

(one station on graphic design, one on video editing and making montages, and one on editing audio for podcasts)
