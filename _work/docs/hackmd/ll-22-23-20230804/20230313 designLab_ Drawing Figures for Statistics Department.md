Hi,

I wanted to reach out with an unusual request.  Some of the teaching faculty in the statistics department (and no doubt some students) are interested in learning how to *draw* certain types of figures and diagrams on a blackboard/whiteboard that come up quite a bit in our teaching.  For example, we are often confronted with trying to draw 3-dimensional graphs projected onto a 2-dimensional blackboard, e.g., graphs that might look like the following: (the photo didn't come through for me)

Do you know of a way to find someone who might be interested and have the capability to instruct some of us on how to draw common but often difficult-to-draw figures?  Basically a mini-art tutorial for drawing
