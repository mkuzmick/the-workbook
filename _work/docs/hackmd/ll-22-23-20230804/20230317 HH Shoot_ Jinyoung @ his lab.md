Casey, Christine, and Jinyoung
## key details
**When:** Friday, March 17, 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
**Where:** 12 Oxford Street, 3rd floor
**What:** Jinyoung's lab
**Point of contact:** Jinyoung

## logistics
Jinyoung will meet LL team in the main entrance of 12 Oxford Street and walk everyone up.

## equipment 


## shot list
### ideas:
there will be 3 videos in his final slide deck from this shoot.

these are the parts we definitely need:
1. Walking up to the lab, shooting the chemistry building
2. Typical chemistry experimenting/tinkering
3. One that’s specific to A/C research doing really cool stuff
    4. part of this one is getting really good shots of the a/c unit, interesting angles and a regular view at


### mk notes
* has some things he’ll share
* shoot in the lab. some scary looking equipment that tells the story (sounds a little Twister-like)
* show a raw version of how research is done
* reminds you of cell membranes
* random inspiration he collects
* slides now
    * summer
    * AC
    * problem with AC is this molecule
    * so gas to solid
    * show solid structure
        * when you squeeze it gets hot
        * when you release it gets cold
        * pressure and temperature related
    * the molecule
        * template hosts each chain well
        * cooling: ordered
        * heated: disordered, twisted, wiggle
    * shows experiment
        * pressurize it 
    * then tweaks the structure
        * synthetic chemistry
        * that’s what we are good at as chemists
    * side by side
        * data
        * visualization
* let’s try for a montage of similar-looking-structures

## packing list
* z cam
* 5D (for stills)
* 5D4
* batteries
* SSD
* prime lenses
    * 24, 35, 50, 85
    * 100 macro
* 2 x softboxes
* 2 x stands
* 2 x power
* power extension
* sachtler tripod
* polarizing filter (to cut down on reflection)
* ND filters (to cut light as it comes into camera)
