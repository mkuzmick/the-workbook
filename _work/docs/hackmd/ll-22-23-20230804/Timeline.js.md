A word on challenges, as you do and/or design them:

These are not tutorials. These are rhetorical mechanics. 

While thousands of resources exist online that help people learn a tool (blender, photoshop, etc.), our challenges help people learn to make an important, frequently-deployed rhetorical move that teachers, scholars, and learners make in their work.

For instance, the first challenge (relative scale) we made was based on something that one of this year's Harvard Horizons presenters asked us to work on (showing the relative sizes of our sun and the super-massive stars that she works on). We use that move in blender, so it became a level one challenge. 

If you find yourself totally at a loss for ideas, it could make sense to go and look at an inventory of text-based maneuvers, because these have typically been catalogued at much greater length. It can be fun to try to imagine what the 3D, video, or graphical equivalents of metaphor, anaphora, anadiplosis, etc. might be.
