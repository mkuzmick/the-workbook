# priorities-for-20220214

## By Scholar
### Adam
will share more with us

### Emilio
has collages of images, maybe a video animating in and out of images with different opacity and blend modes. 
#### to do:
* so any kind of models of that that folks can think of, can start populating his lookbook with that.
* tool time: animate opacity
* Houghton shoot ideas:
    * establish him headed in to library (just in case)
    * establish him in the room
    * loads and loads and loads of closeups of books
    * cut together with shots of Emilio looking at the books
        * we may need to go through a number of different books to make sure that we walk away with the content he needs, and while we're there we may also want to get
    * some bird's eye perfect high res shots of the pages themselves for later use in graphics

### Floor
* caroline and jacob working on orbiting star pairs
* we need visualizations of black holes
#### to do:
* 3d
    * find tutorials of how people have created black holes, stars, sun animations, orbits
* 2D or 3D
    * different ways of visualizign a logarythmic scale so it looks like a lot of stuff (stuff passing through so you see a lot of)
        * showing exponential growth without using a log scale

### Gary
will for sure share more with us
#### to do
* we'll do some kind of media capture
* will bring his brother for us to capture
* maybe try the Fogg instead of the MFA
    * reach out to the Fogg and ask if there's a way we can record something in there for Harvard Horizons (involve Pamela and someone else at GSAS)
    * location scout to look at what greek sculptures do they have, or what other rooms could work - and could then populate lookbooks with this footage
    * could ask llufs what other rooms could play the role of an art museum
* Fogg shoot ideas:
    * establish garry and his brother walking in to museum
    * wides of them walking through rooms especially Greek room
    * shot reverse shot of them talking to each other in front of statue with
    * loads of shots of the key statue (nice CUs and XCUs, some with a little movement)
    * matching CUs of Garry's brother and the statue (just in case we cut them together, one with matching objective view eyelines, one with matching subjective views (i.e. both looking at the camera)
    * shots of Garry talking to brother outside
    * if we don't have enough space or good lighting to get good shots of Garry's brother inside, get some shots of him outside that we could turn to stone

### Gbemisola
#### to do:
wait

### Jinyoung
* he has slides - folks should read the slides and see if they can think of things
#### to do:
* tutorials of molecules
* ask him what we can pull out of his slides to put in his lookbook
* media capture - we'll definitely shoot him in his lab


### Lydia
will send us things Thursday for her lookbook. does a lot on virus transmission and overlaying graphics and maps
#### to do:
wait till Thursday until we get stuff from her

### Ryan
he has a presentation - folks should read the slides and see if they can think of things
#### to do:
* find models of things getting under the skin

### Steven
* he's going to have photos. MK spoke about the possibility of filming photos. 
* he's working in keynote to work on circles to show in group and out group
#### to do:
* finding an example of filmed physical photos to show him

## notes
when scholars send things to slack, we should either
* upload to google drive
* if it's an image, ask if we can make it public to put in HackMD
