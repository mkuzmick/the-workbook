3. let's set up a graphic design station! bring 2 rainbow macs out and get canva and pinterest set up on one and adobe photoshop and illustrator on the other.

3. look for short youtube clips and slack them to #share-your-links. the clips you are looking for should relate to the course material in some way. the course is on **Gender, Race, and Poverty in the United States.**
