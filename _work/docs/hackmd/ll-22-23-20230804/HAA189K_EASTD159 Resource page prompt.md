# HAA189K/EASTD159 Resource page prompt

## Background

### Ask
Hello,

I am writing to inquire about the Learning Lab setting up a resource page for the final project for my course:
https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/106063

The Learning Lab at the Bok Center did this for me previously, providing a page to which I could link in the final project description:
http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/eastd97-final-project-support

My final paper/project will have basically the same resource needs this semester, it would just be great to have a dedicated page. 

[Attached please find the draft description of the final paper/ project for your reference.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AToQQSpnRouR5OR4fy3XYHckobELe_GE/edit)

Thank you for your help,
Melissa
