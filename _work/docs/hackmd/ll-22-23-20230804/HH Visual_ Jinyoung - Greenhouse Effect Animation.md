## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YqVPSJ2cP1y2ZTgnqwpJXVJgqArWTgoe)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N64lu5RepJ45gMCzE5OdPci3TM4HWfsq). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0UZ4dVez1swlUpIw3XYeKKmxRMkvZpo/view?usp=sharing).


## the directions:
### for this build...
make the individual greenhouse gases greyscale - export as separate pngs with transparent background (wille ventually be on black background)

and then make a "cloud of them" to match the shape of the cloud on the slide. - can add a cloud like back ground if needed!

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
