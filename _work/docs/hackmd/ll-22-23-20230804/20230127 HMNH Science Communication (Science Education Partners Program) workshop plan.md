Hi Christine and Jordan,
 
Thanks for your email!
 
Here are few videos that we like for models:
 
[The Brain Scoop – Venoms vs. Poisons](https://youtu.be/i3o72xseBC8)
 
[Science IRL – The First First Fossils](https://youtu.be/-PdUs787qA4)
 
[Let’s Botanize - Carnivorous Plants](https://youtu.be/69JjhxvjJc4)
 
[Let’s Botanize - The Sensitive Fern](https://youtu.be/UQ0Bk5dUG54)
 
If you have other videos that you like, that’s fine too. We’ll let you choose what you think will work best!
 
We are looking forward to seeing you on Friday!
 
Best,
Arielle
