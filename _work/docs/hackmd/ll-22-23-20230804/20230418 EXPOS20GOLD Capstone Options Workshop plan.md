# 20230418 EXPOS20GOLD Capstone Options Workshop plan

## plan

Tentative Plan/hopes for workshop: 

Introduction 
* Marlon to “to do his speech on how to present information in various mediums that are multi-modal, especially with how that might relate to course content.”  
* Samples
    * We’ll look for samples of social media/tiktoks that actually show content. 


Stations
* We can have students try several different sorts of mediums, rotating through different stations (audio, diagrams/assets, video, etc.) 

Creating 
* Engagement statements made in class, then presented on stage (with perhaps visual in the background) 
* Per Marlon:” this helps students practice the rhetorical moves behind a social media post, explaining a rationale with the content” 
* Particular focus on audio and visual components
