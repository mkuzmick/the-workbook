## notes from session 1 (20230127):

atomic structure and zoom inside the structure. tweak one part and see how the other parts are affected.

energy, vibrate, wiggle, twist. a 3d visual. make the molecule more flexible and more twity. like victoria's model. data to compliment. a split screen of data and visual


## meeting with PPMK 20230130

- [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYKe4sMQ51vZ-1g0qVXOpfqMgPWmrNaidFgi0_bphOE/edit#heading=h.d9z3f72d7oeo)

### mk notes on key elements
- working on X material for more fundamental research. How energy interacts with the molecule. How the structure absorbs the least energy.
- joined a new prof (started 2018), so they began together
- gave him a random, high level idea: "just look at this molecule; i think it’s interesting (some sort of intuition—even an aesthetic element)"
    - the molecule looks very flexibly, very hairy
    - the structure is barely held together
- "2 dimensional perovskites"
- emphasis on the quirky ways he works in the lab:
    - 90 percent time studying
    - 10 percent reading random papers
- in any case, they were looking at the molecule for purposes entirely unrelated to AC, but he begins to ask "can I connect them?"
- (though this is not exactly the way it happens really) 
- in order to prove this, they need evidence, but they are a new lab without all of the most advanced instruments/funding, so they need to be creative (MK mentions Twister as reference)
- accent the fact that they use unconventional moves for a Chemistry lab
- "we had to be creative to collect evidence; we couldn’t do what others could do, didn’t have those instruments. we had to invent techniques that could do this"
- so accenting process/product opposition
- used hi pressure equipment to measure this
- a story of how inspiration arrives?
- mk suggests focalizing narrative through the journal-reading thing . . . that way audience is learning basics of AC mechanisms through experience of Jinyoung's earlier self
    - discovers this connection the climate change by accident
    - wow–cooling functions this way
    - OMG I’m actually doing something that can effect climate change.
    - ironic, because initially he tried to escape climate change
        - tried to escape climate, but found my way back to this--potentially something for the end?
    - and now we’re building an AC in the lab (shots of this)

### visuals
- shoot in the lab. some scary looking equipment that tells the story (sounds a little Twister-like)
- show a raw version of how research is done
- let’s try for a montage of similar-looking-structures: montage of molecules, cells, structures
    - to go with "reminds you of cell membranes"
    - or "when a chemist looks at this shape, they get a bunch of ideas"
    - so gas to solid
    - show solid structure
        - when you squeeze it gets hot
        - when you release it gets cold
        - pressure and temperature related
- the molecule itself
- template hosts each chain well
- cooling: ordered
- heated: disordered, twisted, wiggle
- shows experiment
- pressurize it 
- then tweaks the structure
    - synthetic chemistry
    - that’s what we are good at as chemists
- side by side
    - data
    - visualization

### notes from 20230210

- synthetic chemistry
- when you show the process of compression and expansion; citation from data in the 70s and 80s
- 1st gen prototype animations
- diagram of how the AC prototype works
- payoff at scale
-
