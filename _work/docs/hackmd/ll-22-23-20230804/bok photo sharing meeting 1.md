# bok photo sharing meeting 1
20221004 MK+DD+LM

## key context
### TB's slack ask: 
* This morning we talked about resurrecting the Bok Flickr account, especially for P&P photos (FTC, Bok Seminars, etc), but potentially also for good LL photos.  Marlon suggested having a meeting with relevant people to talk more about developing the process for this (e.g. **who decides which photos to upload?  when do we need to worry about permissions, and how do we track that?**).
* A further reflection: my main goal is that it is easy for people to access good photos that were taken at various events.  So, this doesnâ€™t have to be done in Flickr; maybe there is another systems that is equally good.  Maybe it would work to keep photos in Google folders, but, in this case, we need a good system (perhaps Airtable) that would let people find and browse relevant folders.


### goals
#### TB:
* goal is that it is easy for people to access good photos that were taken at various events.
#### MK:
* workflow for making all of the photos be available
* what JK is concerned about
    * holding on to exports and published things and starting to tag them with peoples names etc.
* being aligned with the media production workflow

### questions for laura-
* what are the pain points now
* what do they wish would be better

### framing questions
* what could happen automatically for them
* how could we build this into the central airtable 

### keep in mind
* level of permissions
* tags/keywording

## meeting notes
### ideas:
* using slack to airtable
    * maybe a synced view from a media base that has a P&P view
    * unedited photos go to a feed on airtable maybe and P&P staff can select photos they want edited
* best of or published photos - a zone where all of those goes
    * permanent collection of every photo that has been published by bok

roughly 20 shoots for P&P a year, with 250 max maybe photos per event

right now, the media team is putting together a google drive folder. laura said that might be fine but no one on P&P knows where these photos exist.

to do:
create a Bok photos airtable
* people could depend on that to be record of every photo we've made/used with their permission status
* a smaller version of the photo in airtable, but if they wanted a higher quality photo or different edits they could ask in ##ll-media-requests
* airtable base in Bok Central could have a RAW STILLS table (that gets updated automatically) & Edited Exported Stills 
    * P&P selects, LL edits & exports (normally)
    * add studio@learninglab & media@learninglab to just this base, 


tags table in LL central
string for the tag
then we know what base and table it comes from
courses, people, tools, etc.
dani can start this


## for luke 
add google drive links to folders you shared with P&P

* bok seminar photos
* ftc
* pf orientation/headshots
