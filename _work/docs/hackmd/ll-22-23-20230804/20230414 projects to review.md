## formulating project chunking of the following
* NAHSP projects
    * storytelling workshop series
    * student media capture support

    * an intro session where we launch the project and help them think about storytelling, communicating science and the types of b-roll they should capture with their phones (or camera kits, if they'll have those again), and then give them some basic templates for the final video that will help guide their work over the course of the summer
    * a rehearsal session where they refine their stories-of-the-summer and the visuals they'll use to illustrate their concepts (this session would involve on-camera practice for the final session)
    * a final session during which they will record a live presentation in our small studio, which will form the backbone of the final video project.
* Soul Sessions
    * all editing (can incorporate these as microprojects)
    * sifting through old footage/looking for soundbites/developing questions/themes
    * Make a trailer for people who did research on student experience and transition moments (highest priority)
    * Cleaned up version of all the footage, so cutting off all of the silence, set up time, end time, all of the break gaps. 
    * In an ideal world, going in and marking/timestamping when each of the questions were asked.
* fellows end of year interviews
* contentLab
    * each lab should be a metaproject
    * microproject is pitchDeck, but what is project
