# 20221006 and 20221019 SHBT workshops plan

## plan
* demystifying presentations
    * storytelling/sharing a technical experience in a way that makes it legible to a non-specialist audience
    * visual component: **graphic design principles**
    * **steve jobs presentation**: visual and oral storytelling - unpack this model together
* on your own: use cards to list out keywords and draw icons/images that help tell the story of your research experience/project this past summer
    * try to only include on the card ONE word or ONE image
    * think of your cards as a paper prototype for your slides
    * what data, insight, etc. will you need your slides to convey?
    * is there a process or some context you want us to understand?
* practice telling this micro-version of your story with a partner
    * this is just getting you on the way to creating your presentations that you'll share at the retreat
* provide one another with feedback
* practice again! refining based on the feedback you received from your partner
* then share out as a group on the stage with your cards behind you
    * did your visuals/cards help you tell the story of your summer work?

## space and gear prep
* markers, pens, cards, cool arts supplies on the tables

## media prep
* overhead camera 1 projecting on all screens
* maybe also hdmi into yellow mac so Steve Jobs talk can be presented on projector?
    * with the speakers attached to the yellow mac so we can all hear the video
* key 2 so that presenter can present on stage with cards/visual stories projected behind them 
* stage PA system on so participants can use the mic while they present

## live event support
* CD would love some help with just making sure all of the tech works/nothing weird happens in the middle of the event :)
* live stills are always amazing!

### notes from the instructor:

#### [notes from 20220928 check in with gabe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d95M8dmUXGQrwlekaPbY26fAkM3fo7XGWt3uUdLE0n4/edit#)

#### 
* Getting students who are presenting at the retreat to attend one or two sessions at the Learning Lab to practice the organization of their talk, speaking skills, or other presentation-related items
* From Gabriel - Alright we are all set for the two trainings! October 6th from 10am-11:30am and October 19th from 10am-11:30am. I got 5 'yes' responses for the first session and 10 'yes' responses for the second session. I hope all 5 students attend the first and do not wait to only attend the second. I will reach out to those 5 students in particular to offer encouragement. Also, I am only available to attend the first session, so I will be there with them. I suspect most if not all will attend the later date since there was a lot of interest and it is closer to the event date (~10/29).

#### christine's notes from speaking with GA
* separate session for students who are giving talks - this is separate from the retreat
* essentially new - 2nd and 3rd year students give 12 minute presentation about their work over the summer
* technical in that audience is all specialists but want the research to be accessible to students from different fields
* need to give an intro to what youâ€™re dealing with
* 2 workshops here and get presentation tips, how to intro their subjects
