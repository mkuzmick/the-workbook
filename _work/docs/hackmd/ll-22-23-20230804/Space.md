# Space

## Space development
deadline 1/20, LL WTW Session
### Main Studio Rebuild
* finalize racks in Control Room (new power, rotate, max out inputs and outputs)
### Redesigning small rooms and spaces on the office side of 50 church
#### what we want **functionally** out of small spaces:
* podcasting
* video
* art room
* editing
* PCs/gaming (wall instead of room? like in an open space?)
* storage
* meeting rooms
* office hours
* functional classroom
#### List of spaces + some ideas
* storage rooms
    * activating so these can be workspaces too
    * one could be a documentation station? (or this could happen in the classroom)
* glass studio (room 381)
* editing suite (room 377)
* open space
    * improve! make easier for charging
* front desk
* music room (room 307)
    * ask: door from control room to here, so could access not via main studio!
* back hallway
    * get rid of cabinets in the back?
    * would need to figure out:
        * cubbys for LLUF stuff
        * storage space for printer paper
## Furniture fabrication (CC)
* hanging baskets for the mac studios
* custom attachments for truss and pipe (ie. for front desk)
