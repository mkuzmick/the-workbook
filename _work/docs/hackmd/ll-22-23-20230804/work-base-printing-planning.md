# work-base-printing-planning

## brainstorming
tasks get printed based on
* type
* available for

we'd like, when launching a project (or specific type of task) to auto launch specific tasks that are for specific groups. ie:
* workshop plan 
* workshop delivery 
* workshop materials prep (llufs)
* workshop set up? (mpas)
* workshop report (lead+kevin)
