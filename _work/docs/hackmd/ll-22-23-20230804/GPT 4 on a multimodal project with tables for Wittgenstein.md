# GPT 4 on a multimodal project with tables for Wittgenstein

### Kevin:

Imagine a group of students learning about the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. The students are in a room in which there are several tables, each operating as a kind of station where a different aesthetic and cognitive medium is being engaged. What might these specific media be in order to best teach the students the thought of Wittgenstein? And how might the students interact with these media differently and then interact with each other, each medium and group informing the rest?

### ChatGPT-4:

This sounds like a fascinating and interactive way to learn about Wittgenstein's work! Here are some ideas for the stations:

**Language Game Station:** Students can participate in 'language games,' a concept introduced by Wittgenstein. These could involve constructing new, self-contained 'languages' using sets of symbols or activities, to understand how language use is embedded in a form of life and is not simply a representation of the world.

**The Picture Theory of Language Station:** Here, students can engage in activities that revolve around Wittgenstein's 'picture theory' from the Tractatus. They can create art, diagrams, or symbols to represent propositions, illustrating how sentences 'picture' the states of affairs in the world.

**Philosophical Investigations Reading Group:** This station could involve reading and discussing Wittgenstein's later work, Philosophical Investigations, to explore his evolving ideas about language, meaning, and understanding.

**Ladder of Ideas Station:** This station could include physical ladders or drawings of ladders to symbolize Wittgenstein's metaphor in the Tractatus that one must climb up the ladder of understanding and then throw it away once one understands. It could involve discussions about the limits of language and the things that must be passed over in silence.

**'Forms of Life' Drama Station:** Here, students could act out scenes or skits to embody Wittgenstein's notion of 'forms of life'â€”the shared practices and ways of living that make language meaningful.

**Private Language Argument Station:** Students could attempt to create a 'private language' that only they can understand, reflecting on why Wittgenstein argues this would be impossible due to the communal nature of language.

Each station provides a different mode of engaging with Wittgenstein's ideas. After spending time at each station, students could come together to share their experiences, insights, and questions, creating a dynamic, multidimensional understanding of Wittgenstein's work. They could perhaps be encouraged to map out connections and conflicts between the concepts they explored at different stations, representing the shift in Wittgenstein's own thought from his early to later work. This multi-modal, participatory approach might help students gain a deep and lasting understanding of Wittgenstein's complex and influential philosophical ideas.

This is great! Now imagine that several stations have digital technology, including video cameras and green screens, and also computers with software programs including Blender for 3-D modeling, the Adobe Creative Suite, Unity, and Logic Pro. The students also have access to GPT-4. How could these be used together and also used with the other media you list above?


### ChatGPT-4:

Digital technology can further enhance the understanding and appreciation of Wittgenstein's philosophy in a highly immersive and interactive way. Here's how the stations might evolve:

**Language Game Station (Digital Remix):** Utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite, students can create digital 'language games' using symbols, visual designs, or animations. This can include creating short films with green screens where the language and its rules shift from scene to scene. This visual language can be shared with the rest of the group for understanding and interpretation.

**The Picture Theory of Language Station (3D Upgrade):** With Blender or Unity, students can create 3D models or even interactive virtual worlds that depict their understanding of Wittgenstein's picture theory. For instance, they could build a world where every object stands in some logical relation to the others, reflecting the logical structure of propositions.

**Philosophical Investigations Reading Group (Podcast Style):** Students can use video cameras to record discussions and reflections, or use Logic Pro to record and edit a 'Philosophical Investigations' podcast. This podcast can be shared with others to provoke further discussion. GPT-4 could be used here to generate possible counter-arguments or questions to stimulate deeper analysis.

**Ladder of Ideas Station (Virtual Reality):** The concept of the 'ladder of ideas' could be explored through an interactive VR experience created in Unity. Students ascend a virtual ladder as they learn about the concepts, which are then discarded or 'thrown away' at the top, simulating the metaphor of Wittgenstein.

**'Forms of Life' Drama Station (Film Production):** Students can use green screens and video editing software to produce short films or skits that depict different 'forms of life.' They can create alternative realities or symbolic worlds to illustrate the concept.

**Private Language Argument Station (AI Language Test):** Students can attempt to 'teach' a private language to GPT-4. When the AI fails to 'understand' or generate meaningful sentences in the 'language' (as it will lack the 'form of life' context), this will help illustrate Wittgenstein's argument against the possibility of a truly private language.

The digital creations from each station could be shared with the entire group, allowing everyone to engage with Wittgenstein's ideas in a range of modalities. Each medium provides a different perspective and form of engagement, helping to create a robust, multifaceted understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophy.
