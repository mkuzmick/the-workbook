# EDUS307A Gallery of Modes of Documentation for Arts Educators  20220930 happening plan
## plan
Aysha taking the lead on facilitating on Friday
### Sarah H slacked out a session outline:
* 3:30-4:15 - Teaching Team arrives to set up
* 4:15-4:30 - Community arrival (passive warm-up via prompts on screens & tables)
* 4:30-4:40 - Warm-up
* 4:40-4:50 - Meet Bok folks - 3 minute mini-lecture from Marlon about LL & documentation
* 4:55-5:00 Explain Stations:
    * 25 minutes each at two stations
        * Round one: all students - overhead cameras and cards
        * Round two: choice between 2 stations - video or audio
* 5:00 - 5:10 - Solo Prep: 
    - Students pull out their responses to prompts sent via email, begin to write key words/phrases on cards for Round One
* 5:10-5:35 - Round one:
    * 2-3 stations with overhead camera - index card flip book/gif – all students engage in this activity at once, with a prompt about creative process specific to Baldwin reading. Students create cards to be turned into gif, as well as engage in activities to sort/pair/cluster cards together to draw connections between students’ thoughts and generate discussion
    *Prompt:  Baldwin states: “The role of an artist, then, is to illuminate that darkness…so that we will not…lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”  
    * What is your role as an artist/creative to society?

* 5:35 - 5:40 – Transition
* 5:40 - 6:05 Round two:
    * Choice between – video interview station or podcast interview station, with prompts relating to the teaching process, which will be supporting/building up to students creating teaching/artist statements and manifestos at a later date.
        * Podcast interview:
            * 2/3 tables, a couple of mics all running to one computer. Students will have an opportunity to rotate in these small groups to record audio responses to prompt. Suggest 30 seconds of audio, and roll with it if they have more to say.
        * Video interview:
            * Similar to above, recording audio for podcast-style interview
    - Prompt: Who are you? What do you care about? What do you do that services that care?
* 6:05-6:10 - Bio Break
* 6:10-6:25 - Share out – whole group
* 6:25-6:30 - Quick speed dating for project homies. Gratitude & Depart

### notes from the instructor
#### notes from 20220929 zoom check in
* Aysha taking the lead on facilitating
* Aysha has some logistic concerns and proposed changes
* Aysha and Sarah can come early to set up
* MK suggested starting out in pairs or groups of 4
    * so 8 to 10 people at each table
    * so then you show your cards to a partner
    * then a pair of pairs shows
    * then the table assembles their cards on the overhead
    * prompts could be around identify points in common or of divergence
    * could invite someone from each table to do a impromptu 1 minute presentation 
* MK clarified that there are 4 tables and 4 overhead stations.
* so likely trios and then groups of 6, then the full table can chat
* aysha asked for feedback on interview question and asked where all of that data goes
    * MK said we can certainly record everything and then they can decide what they want to do with it. MK pointed out that audio won't be pristine since everyone will be doing this - mk said this is more people having fun and learning, if we want to really record we'd want to set that up separately
    * MK said let's think about how many stations we need. for podcast set ups - those are easier. 
        * 12 stations overall? aim for 6 and 6 podcasting and video,
        * MK said we don't have enough stations to JUST do podcasting. Aysha asked how many. MK said we could probably do 6. MK said they could also be using props and could think about visual capture of objects at the video stations
        * MK suggested story of self, story of us, story of now with tension to resolution structure - could maybe also be useful as a prompt for interviewing
            * Louisa said this would be great for them to have as a record, of footage (so maybe we do want to record - Aysha had said she doesn't want to accidentally create too much, so maybe not recording everything?)

aysha said prompts should be the same at both video and pocasting stations. 

aysha asked about video station numbers
* MK said if we have them in 9 groups of 3-4 people, in total 5 stations of each video and podcasting (if it needs to be 4 video stations then we can add a 5th podcasting station)
* MK asked about a LL-y set up for why we have these stations. the intimacy of this kind of storytelling, talking close to the mic or talking looking at the camera (MK can do this)
    * louisa said they can also talk about in terms of the arts - different ways of connecting with the world (so actually MK and Louisa can do this)
* louisa said something useful to flag to students - archival footage (?) that folks can come back to us to see how people have used this media
    * MK said christine has loads of project write ups that have linked media embedded
    * Aysha said they can also link things on their canvas page, sending follow up email, their newsletter
* MK asked what support we want to talk about over the course of the year, through Sarah, the next event, etc.
    * Aysha said: for just tomorrow, explaining what the LL is. 
    * and after tomorrow we can meet up to figure out:
        * process documenting of the program
        * and working with us scale wise - what would be the most tenable thing to do with such a large group of students
        * revist after tomorrow what other sessions (if not this term, then next term), working with sarah to help folks process documenting, etc.

Louisa asked if there's one day in particular that works for Sarah to be around for students to drop in:
* MK said evenings really, but can work around Sarah's availability
* and we want to figure out fewer, big impact events at key points in the term
#### notes from 20220923
* 6 total stations of 3 activities?
* like a poster fair, go at your pace around the stations instead of spending 
* it'll be 40 students
    * 6 or 7 students in a group, spend 15-20 minutes in each station, so rotate 3 times.
* everyone's reading james baldwin's text on the creative process. so what they do in the different stations could somehow connect to a part of the creative process
    * MK asked if there were conceptual categories or key terms or oppositions from this text
    
##### LP's thoughts
exploring the creative process through different media (so maybe not all students get to every station/explore every different media)

##### activites to do:
MK suggests starting out with everyone thinking about the creative process on cards AND THEN everyone does the interview thing 
* every table could have it's own overhead and the screen could show all 4 tables at once
* then a little talking/teaching
* then everyone thinks about artist teachers' statement/philosophy in interview (video recording + podcasting stations)
* could say something about documentation as we're doing this overall for today but if you want to think more about this, we can help with this.

##### stations
* for card stations at each table - everyone reflects on the creative process
  * MK - suggested card sorting activites. and we capture every card and can send back as part of a thank you package
* interview stations  - all about teaching/artists statement/philosophy
    * video recording in small studio? 30 seconds of "this is what the creative process means to me" (so building an archive/capturing a gallery of different responses)
    * podcasts/voice zones - shared experience with someone talking station for workshopping artist or teaching statement (where one person interviews another)
        * 3-4 computers on each table with 3-4 headphones/people at each computer

could do mini shares for 5 minutes and then do a bigger share at the end
* bigger share: could ask a volunteer from each zone to talk about (LP said that's a great idea)

SO for sorting people:
* cards - whichever table they're at, they end up working with the people there
* can give people the choice of which medium they want to go for the different interview stations
    * everyone could have a couple of minutes - switching roles as the interviewer, the interviewee, and the producer

#### relevant notes from 20220913 zoom meeting
MK said we could work with Sarah to design an activity that would work for this number of people, suggested stations (Louisa very excited about this idea), have intentional experiences that would sum up to something at the end of it. The stations have to work to be done in any order tho.

Louisa said stations are perfect. Maybe students could get a professional photo taken. Using the cards to documenting what creativity means to them or their thoughts on the creative process. If Sarah can take the lead on putting together a draft schedule for that workshop. Maybe showing some of the work that Aysha has done in collaboration with us. Maybe seeing some of the other work the LL has done with students so they can understand more of what’s possible for them.

MK said he can imagine a lecture-y show and tell, move to stations then, and then bring everyone back together and maybe some present or do a group discussion

MK likes the idea of them using cards to draw/write their sense of the creative process. Would be cool to have a grid of all the cards with their images, and then their names

From Louisa - brings their reflection to a whole new level, if we can somehow during station activities - pull out moments of what they’ve been doing in the space - like little snippets of videos - that we can then project onto a bigger screen - like a live gallery. (MK says we can do this).

Maybe the final sharing at the end - we project behind them something they’ve finished making and they can present about it, and Louisa can help facilitate this part, connect it to theory etc.

From louisa - sarah should start drafting a workshop plan, format for stations and what equipment, what printouts are needed, etc. MK asked if they should create a handout takeaway for each station (louisa said yes maybe or maybe just an online resource - could be distributed beforehand as a PDF which could be printed if they want). MK said we should think about playful things about marking up their pdf
