# HH Visual: Adam - Current Montage
## the ask:
(one liner description)

Tools: Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro



## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNoMbrKTz7eqJ3ll1Ag8P25EAnJgsvXH)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EPn9rbOGoJP1oaCys_9rHGCwuxJfRXW4). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_1kz-XgLO8GmCGYW-DukGpj8Lp-t_w56/view?usp=sharing). the montage would be at the very end of the talk.


## the directions:
### for this build...
we want a short montage to replace the last few slides of the talk. we for sure want to include EVERY image in the slides so far, but we can also try adding in a few more shots from the sourced footage folder (also in the drive folder). [Here is a montage we made for a separate talk last year that you might use as a reference.](https://youtu.be/4qBuVCwlPAU?t=3274)

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
