# Recording check in
*(booking/forms/sending footage/etc.)*


## steps
* booking (MW [scheduling shoots](/nTj4LOcUTc-PT5YqwW29BA))
* [shoot information form draft](https://airtable.com/appICA5tIKwtxgHSq/tblzQoD9QLeUpc5hF/viwVQ8cJSqryqwpZs?blocks=hide)
    * some of this could be filled out before with info we already know from the course consultation
    * some we need to ask as we're booking
    * some of this would need to be filled out after
    * DD&MW fill out the form with as much info as possible and then show to people via editable interface
    * edits to form:
        * post production reqs - structure
* live logging
* ingesting footage
* uploading footage to gdrive
    * Script for making folders for the french10 and 11 recordings in drive - can we reactivate?
    * should we try to use this for more than just french?
* sending footage to clients

## to do
* sync a view of the events base to the photovideo base. where will everything that has media live? in the events base or the shoot info form..
    * prob the events base
* create a parallel list of shoot appointments in events table with type shoot and create an interface off that
    * add a project media folder 
    * add a select for who will send back to client and a check box that it's been sent 
* think about whether we need specific resources for each course given that we have such uniquely tailored support plans... (MK+DD+MW)
