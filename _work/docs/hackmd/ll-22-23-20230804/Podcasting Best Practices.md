# Podcasting Best Practices

## 1. Make sure you are as close to the mic as possible without being uncomfortable.
The closer your mouth is to the mic the lower you can set the mic's gain and the lower the level of white noise will be present. Around 6-12 inches away from the mic is a good range. 

## 2. Set your levels/gain
Depending on what type of microphone you are using you should have some control over the gain or senstivity of the mic. If you are using a USB-microphone then you should be able to see how "hot" your mic is by looking at the audio levels. Typcially a good range to stay in between is about -6db to -12db. This will give you the option to bring up your audio levels in post, but will save your audio from clipping while recording.

## 3. Try not to move around too much
This might seem like an ovbious one, but moving around can cause a lot of abnormalites in your audio. Any contact you have with the mic or what its sitting on can send vibrations through your microphone which will show up in your recording. 

## 4. Use a pop filter

When speaking into a microphone the audible sounds produced from the letters "P" and "T" are called plosives. Plosives can produce a harsh sound in your recording that sound like a burst of air. Using a pop filter in front of your microphone will prevent these plosives from coming throuhg in your recording. 

## 5. Use a DeNoiser in post production
If you find that your recording has a lot of white noise, try applying a DeNoiser effect on your audio. Most DAW or recording programs have prebuilt DeNoisers that should significantly help reduce noise. 

## 6. Apply an EQ
This is highly subjective but applying an EQ can drastically change the way your audio sounds. I'll put some links down below that go more in depth on the different ways to EQ your audio.



## Troubleshooting
* If you are using a USB-Microphone and recording using a Windows machine sometimes Windows enables "Enhancements" to the Audio which can introduce a fair amount of noise in your audio. 
    * In sound settings, go to 'Input Device Properties', then on the right side of the screen click 'additional device properties', then on 'Enhancements'. Disable anything that is checked in this window.

* If you are still experiencing noise in your audio it could be an electrical interference that is causing the problem. Unfortunately this is harder to troubleshoot, however try changing out your cables from the mic into the computer or whatever device you are using to record. If using a laptop, unplugging the power can often reduce electrical noise that comes through in your audio.
