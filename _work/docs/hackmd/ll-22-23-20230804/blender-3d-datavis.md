# blender-3d-datavis

## the challenge

For this challenge we'd like you to create a 3d data visualization in Blender. The goal is to use some real data (and data that's appropriate for the scope of the visualization you intend to build).

If you don't necessarily come from a quantitative background you can absolutely work with a simple set of 5-7 numbers and manually produce a bar chart--that's no problem. If you'd prefer not to get involved with JSON and Python and arrays and objects there will plenty of exciting possibilities for you in the next challenge (create an infographic).

But if you DO want to create things based on a slightly more complex dataset, please do share it with us (along with your completed .blend file) when you're done.


## key skills

- basic blender skills (adding objects, positioning, resizing)
- working with blender text
- (optional) create a Python script in Blender that generates your datavis based on a `.json` or `.csv` file. Feel free to use ChatGPT, but if you do, create some screenshots to help tell the story of how it assisted you (and try to make sure that you understand the code and aren't just copying and pasting! :)

## for bonus points

- create a Python script that pulls data from a web-based API to visualize something you'd like to see live updates for
