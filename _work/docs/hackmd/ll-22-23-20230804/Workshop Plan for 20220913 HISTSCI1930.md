# Workshop Plan for 20220913 HISTSCI1930

## Plan 

*center around live podcasting!*

### at stations:
taste testing station: distinguish between condenser and dynamic mics
stage: dynamic mics good for stage and why it's not feeding back, this makes that apparent 

what's the story in this sound?
* find a strange, mysterious sound (flipping cards in front of phone)
    * record something that has something connected to history of science (so record a car, elevator, etc.)
* record it with your phone
* come back and give it as a live performance with logic loops

4 groups get objects
4 groups get locations

### Notes from the Instructor:
#### from consultation notes:
We’ll do the first session: september 13th, 4:45-5:45pm 
* Introducing to microphones, the idea of telling stories with sound, live fun activity around that, letting them know they CAN borrow microphones from us (they can also record on their phones), and if needed could book a little time
* Can mention resources during this workshop (Lamont Media Lab, Cabot has recording booths) - we can send these links back to Dave (someone at Lamont does podcasting tutorials - let’s try to figure this out and let dave know who does this)
    * Microproject resource doc - We’ll put together one about “so you want to make a podcast” + podcasting editing tools (deadline is the first session)
* October 25th second session: we’ll hold the whole class 3-5:45pm but likely Dave will just want to do it at the beginning half. We’ll likely do a bit more in editing but we’ll make sure to check in with dave about where they are in the process to determine really is the plan for this session.

#### from email
* Dave - I'm keeping my streak going with another class that seems right in the Learning Lab's zone. This one is called "Podcasting the History of Science" and the plan is to do exactly that: create 15-30 minute audio-rich narrative podcasts about science/history of science. Like the digital storytelling class, but with podcasts.I was hoping to grab some time with you to talk through my overall plan for the class, see if you know good podcast-making resources, and talk about a Learning Lab class visit in the fall.
* Dani - I’ve gone ahead and scheduled workshops for HISTSCI1930 on 9/13, 4:45-5:45pm, as well 3-4:45pm on 10/25 (though I’ve noted that the workshop portion might just be the beginning half). We’ll also be working on a podcasting resource for your students that will be ready for 9/13.I’ve done a little googling to see who at the [Lamont Media Lab](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/lamont-multimedia-lab) might be able to help with podcasting tutorials, and I came across this webpage which lists some of the staff and things they can help with, but I am suspicious that this hasn’t been updated in a while: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/73232/pages/contact-us. I couldn’t find anything more specific than this unfortunately. In addition, here is a link for the [Cabot Media Studios](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/cabot-media-studios).

 

### space and gear prep:

### media prep:
* JK question: who is building the podcasting resource mentioned by dani above?

* live podcast
5:30-5:45:
