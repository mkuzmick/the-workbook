# 20230411 EXPOS20Alqera Instagram Capstone Workshop plan

## plan

### takeaway goals:
* how to convey ideas in a non-paper format
    * With a focus on social media as that alternative form
* With social media; how to condense ideas into the shortest form
    * But also how to make content feel cohesive when strung together: 
        * what are the themes?
        * what are the design choices?
        * What is the content?


### prep from instructor: 
* on tuesday, they will already be grouped by similar interest (average of three per group)  
* The students know  and have thought about their assignment, linked [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZb1qv2I9VXS7iX9K5j5L0Vpf15kD4rZ/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=117256173551810667274&rtpof=true) 
    * For us to know: 
        * each post needs a 75 word caption minimum 
        * there is a minimum of three posts per student (nine posts per group) 
        * Main references used in class that we may want to pull in: 
            * Thich Nhat Hanh
            * Bruce Lee 
            * Lebron James


### tentative plan: 

* Introduction 
    * Sheza asked specifically for marlon “to do his speech on how to present information in various mediums that are multi-modal, especially with how that might relate to mindfulness.”  
* Stations
    * We can have students try several different sorts of mediums, rotating through different stations (audio, diagrams/assets, video, etc.) 
        * audio/CU (from small studio)
        * stage composite
        * canva/graphic
        * photo station
        * audience and algo
* Creating 
    * Engagement statements made in class, then presented on stage (with perhaps visual in the background) 
        * Per Marlon:” this helps students practice the rhetorical moves behind a social media post, explaining a rationale with the content” 
        * Particular focus on audio and visual components
