### Notes from the Instructor:

8/30 response from AJ 
Yes! That’s correct – I run the workshop. I do need a little bit of help setting up the cameras/tvs etc, but other than that, I can do it! 9/12 would be great. I’m open pretty much anytime that day, with a slight preference for connecting in the afternoon. I won’t be on campus, so if we could do Zoom that would be great.

8/30 from Dani
Marlon’s recollection is that for these analysis workshops, our involvement is a little less hands on - we essentially introduce the space and are there to answer questions and jump in a bit, but you really run the workshop. If that’s still the case, checking in on 9/12 should work fine! It’s only if you wanted us to do something more elaborate that we should check in earlier. Please let me know your thoughts! If the plan is mostly the same as in the past, we are available anytime after 10am.


### space and gear prep:

- we need 4 overheads
- and presets for presenters to be referencing them
- but main presentations will still happen at the front of the room
