# 20230302&03 GENED1030 LL Studio Tours

## plan
the classroom: normal section for 50 minutes
the studio: studio tour for 10 minutes

## key points

- Your course has the support of the CompLit MDF Minji Choi, who is also the Head TF for your course
- She will be making use of the LL's resources to support you
    - Minji will be setting up times for your sections to visit the Main Studio for workshops on creative assignments
    - you will be able to book time in our small studio if you need to record voiceover or a talking-head-style interview or performance
    - we have office hours from 3-5 Monday to Thursday and all day (9-5) on Friday for courses our MDFs are supporting (though Minji won't necessarily be here the whole time!)
- we know from the course that you'll potentially be creating audiovisual or media projects that critically dramatize themes of the course, or some other web, audiovisual or media project in consultation with your TF
- so at this stage you are probably still deciding what to do--and that's fine! we can see you again for the workshop in April, but here are few sorts of things we've seen students do in the past (and why you'd want to do them)

## space and gear prep
## media prep
*  Makes sense for them to see different creative projects that people have done in the past that we’ve curated (a reel, showing/looping on different screens
*  TODO:
    *  find footage of dance/performance projects
        *  maybe dance on camera? or jessi loop or maybe james bedford
    *  paris and the 60s
    *  rise of the sporophyte
