<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s time to tell you a story about the origin of the name &quot;Fiona&quot;. A good old Scottish name, you might think. And it is, in a way, a name very representative of Scottish culture and literature. But not in the way you might think...</p>&mdash; Josie Giles (@HJosephineGiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/HJosephineGiles/status/1555216419721297922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

##
## Notable Features
* Can continue to update
* Free and easy to use, a highly accessible format - but also copyright restrictions (fair use?)
* Interactivity - engagement with audience - and with other Twitter accounts
    * Likes and replies; polls
    * Twitter metrics



## Presentation of evidence
* Incorporation of different kinds of media (interactive polls, still images, hyperlinks, gifs) - but links also go dead (ephemeral form)
* Starting with a clear hook (how does the thread start to generate interest?); pacing and timing of thread (posted all at once? throughout the day?)
* Text with a strict character limit
    * Breaks things down concisely (but risk of oversimplifying) - which is also the point of the system (misinterpretation - disagreement - Twitter storms - more engagement, clicks)
* Tone 
    * chatty, casual, personal (using different registers - "Here's some info" / "I LOVE THIS SHOW!")
    * also can be argumentative, meant to spark discord/debates
* Question of authority / who is speaking?
    * Anonymity (benefits and risk of)

## Scaffolding Assignments

* Compiling images: what narrative/argument to tell with them
* Identifying and tracking patterns, repetitions within a text
    * something that initially seems insignificant but is actually important
    * maybe within a few films to start with? in order to limit the data set! 
* how to work with huge amounts of data/text/images?
    * training an algorithm?
* crafting the hook; identifying the starting and end point (tweet 1, tweet n), beyond graphic resemblances
