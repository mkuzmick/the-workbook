# 20230124 Youth Lead the Change workshop plan

## plan

the plan:
* we'll unpack a few models (they're going to send us a couple ASAP that they especially like)
* we'll move into stations: video editing in Final Cut; basic moves in Canva (using it as an all-purpose tool); doing a workflow in the Adobe Creative Suite (going from Photoshop to Illustrator); and speaking to camera in the small studio (we thought they could do 20 second introductions which we'll capture on camera)
* we'll have the students wander around and choose a station to focus on/do work in and we'll give them feedback on their work/consult with them
* group reflection/share out at the main studio table (so we can capture footage of them for their website!)
* small studio: give the tips to the students while speaking to camera; student intro themselves and say one sentence about why this is important
* JK: here's how to mask in Ps and here's how to vectorize a photo in Illustrator - just one move
* video editing: make clips, get a montage, maybe some color correction
* canva: the surprises in this tool!

### notes from the instructor
From Ayah and Ethan 1/22:
Hi,

It was a pleasure coming this past week! Thank you for working with us to bring this opportunity to life. The [folder that is attached here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WkPQxe3-7EEFcRcL_iZ6I5_QSnXI7nil) has everything we mentioned from models (on google doc) to ideas. We have also attached our case studies which we would love to play around with in the session. Our team numbers are at about 15-18 members! We're all incredibly excited to come in and learn! 

If there's anyway we can also create a Zoom background for our team through learning Adobe that would be a cool activity. Please let us know if you need anything else from our end. We appreciate you all. 

We look forward to seeing you soon!

Kind regards,
