### 20221031 Consultation notes:
So far: students did an in-class workshop where they listened to a 10-minute podcast together and then two 1-minute podcasts, conceptually on similar material but really different styles; all three episodes were narrative style podcasts and that’s what their assignment is - allowed students to analyze aspects of the structure of how two different hosts went through unpacking and then they contrasted differences in style and pacing; Jessica generated audio scripts as written texts to share with them so that they could look at what was written and think about how it sounded, how to make it more engaging - what changes they’d make
What they haven’t done: doing any of the technical aspects of making

**JK:** podcast as a machine, the different parts of the machine and how that supports content that’s being spoken; different in audio quality, etc.
-sometimes we look at academic writing and think about how it would be different in a podcast

**JJ:** students were thinking about how to change the podcast to make it more engaging - intonation, language 
But students haven’t thought about how to make the audio communicate to listeners in different ways
So far they’ve focused on unpacking how to create a compelling narrative for their 5-7 minute podcast episodes that they’re creating
Recommending that they’re integrating additional audio to make it more interesting but more like sampling clips from interviews, other types of audio - this is meant to help you emphasize or help you communicate but shouldn’t convey the main information - you and your voice should primarily drive the episode
So additional audio not required but recommended

**JK:** podcast analogues to academic essay - primary source data that you’re analyzing 

**JJ:** so far students have done
Proposal
Outline
Script is coming next

Marlon recommended having students practice recording - so Jessica has them recording their summaries (50 words) so that they get some feedback and a peer on how that worked
-this will be later/after this workshop

**JK:** recording tips, practice recording with the phone and doing testing where you record with your phone at different lengths like a science experiment; have different types of mics that we could bring - mic taste testing activity; give students bite-sized experience of producing podcast from start to finish - GarageBand but could do it with other tools, import audio, how do you trim it, move it around, ingest it, how to have different tracks of audio and stack them, how to add a music bed - what kind of music and when to bring it in, adjusting levels, exporting

**JJ:** really wants students to focus on editing and getting professional quality audio
Not as concerned about additional audio if we are short on time - possible to put this in a resource that we would share with them afterward?

**JK:** yes we’ll come with a folder that will be media assets that we can share with them (google drive); we’ll have everything in that folder and we can go over - here’s where you’d go to get audio clips, free music clips, etc.

GET A RESOURCE TO THEM FOR THIS!

16 students in the class - all individuals working on their own podcasts
In pairs to do this workshop - have a buddy to learn the tool 
Technologically it’ll be more feasible for us to troubleshoot 

Do they have computers?
We’ll bring some just in case - laptops
But we don’t have eight laptops so if we could know what students have that’ll be helpful

They’ll bring their computers and phones to class this week and Jessica will remind them and will also ask anyone with a PC to let her know

**JJ:** possible to give students five minutes to record a little soundbite on their phones; then edit these in garageband together

**JK:** if you could send us what you’d like them to read, we can record it ourselves and put it in the folder so they can edit that just in case something goes awry with their recordings, they’ll have something to work with then
-finding the soundbite seems important

**JJ:** yes - has been telling students, you’re aiming for 3-4 page script that’s 750-1100 words; wants to prevent the type of thing where students have way too much 
-as you write your script, consider when you might want to use other bits of audio to supplement or to deepen your listener’s engagement with your podcast

We’ll share open studio times with students too
Share google drive link with Jessica so she can add it to the module on Canvas
JK will bring laptop and share screen during demo
Will also have the asynchronous resource they can use as well
