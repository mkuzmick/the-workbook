#  20230412 EXPOS20Rosefield Podcast Interview Workshop plan

## plan


* quick intro where we (very quickly!) listen to both the NPR and Slate clips (approx. 1 minute from each) and they can share with me some of their observations about the differences in terms of audio quality, who's discussing, etc. 
* Students map out on cards their ideal interlocutor, namely the questions they'd want this person to ask and in what order
* Then, students will think about *why* they want those questions and in that progression. On a different color card, they can map out the key points of the story that they want to be able to tell about their number. This would help them rehearse their story (by thinking about it as having these component parts that they want to address throughout the interview).
    * But then we can talk about the fact that interviews are not necessarily linear--you're still responding to another person who will take the conversation in a particular direction (and that being ready for this is an important aspect of making sure the interview conversation, whether with a friend or an expert, still sounds organic.) They want to know their material well enough that they can respond to their interlocutor, but they want to maintain control by knowing what the core "thread" of their narrative is. Hopefully thinking about this "Why" (why these questions, why this order would help them keep in mind the bigger picture story about their number).
* Then we'll do an activity where the partners think about whether their podcast will adhere to the "friend" or "expert" model and what form the prep for those interviews will accordingly take. I'll have some zones set up with different mics: One in the main studio where they can think about what it's like to capture sound in an environment, using their full voices; the other in a smaller studio with podcasting mics that produce a more intimate sounding quality. 
* Once they've thought about what pre-interviewing will look like (and we'll talk as a group about what the key components of interview prep tend to be at places like NPR), they can choose a zone to practice in with their partner! (So this kind of two-part activity will get them thinking, on the one hand, about how you prepare for an interview, and on the other, about what type of recording environment and audio you ideally want to get. We will encourage them to record with their phones for their projects, but we can use the mics as thinking tools, if that sounds good to you.)
* We'll finish up with a demo in GarageBand--we'll supply them with computers and assets, so they don't need to prep anything for this. MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE MUSIC!
