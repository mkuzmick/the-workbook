40 students attending a retreat
professional development optional session
geared toward both younger students and more senior students - helping them learn to talk about themselves (for younger), for older students - networking at conferences, developing a kind of technical elevator pitch


separate session for students who are giving talks - this is separate from the retreat
essentially new - 2nd and 3rd year students give 12 minute presentation about their work over the summer
technical in that audience is all specialists but want the research to be accessible to students from different fields
need to give an intro to what you're dealing with
2 workshops here and get presentation tips, how to intro their subjects
