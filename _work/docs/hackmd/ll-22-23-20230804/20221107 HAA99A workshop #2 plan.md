### notes from the instructor: 
* Nov 7 - Errs towards academic presentations vs. improvisation. Tailored towards an academic audience but it shouldn’t be dry. They haven’t really done a lot of presentation prep in the past though.

#### Consultation Notes: 
* Senior thesis seminar overview
    * Every year at the end of course in the fall, students present thesis as it stands (though they have the spring to complete it)
    * Looking for someone to provide support on teaching presentation skills, how to make an engaging presentation
    * Someone to provide basic technology and image manipulation, storage archiving (three identified largely - photoshop (ie. how to crop, dpi resolution), image storage and archiving in whatever software, powerpoint (not the basics, but how to make an engaging presentation and animation to be engaging)

November 7 potential plan (from July)
* potentially practice some of the “moves” identified above if they don’t fit in session 1
* tools for presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, Canva, Google Slides) and visual essays. ​Most students (in my experience) make a very limited use of Ppt. and very few would know of Keynote. I like the way it is planned so that in the first session they know what can be done, and this week they put it into practice first with PPt that they know better, and then with Keynote that would probably be new to them.
* visual story structures (building on the “moves” above—how do we link these together into larger wholes? how can we create complex series of “builds” in Keynote or PowerPoint to achieve this?)
* oral presentation tips and practice
    * voice and body as instruments
    * alternatives to rote memorization
    * practice with feedback
#### Slack Messages from Yue: 
* @christine I communicated with both the class and Felipe, and we came up with several ideas for next Monday’s workshop. The overall goal is to practice presentations and help modify ideas in their these. Ex. 1. (40 mins.) [Table-scape] “Introduce the anchor of your paper.” Among the group members, introduce to each other the “anchor” of your thesis (could be one painting/artwork, one artist, one concept, or one media). Give key questions revolving around the anchor and explain how each chapter of your paper is related to the anchor. Use the cards and think in terms of diagrams or mind maps. With these visual tools, also tell us where you are now at your writing and research.    Ex. 2. (20 mins.) [Visual Analysis A: single image] In less than 3 minutes, introduce an image that is crucial in your paper. Point at two to three details, connecting them to your interpretation or argument. (20 mins.) [Visual Analysis B: image comparison] In less than 3 minutes, compare and contrast. Tell why you select the pair and how they support or challenge your/existing ideas.  Ex. 3. (30 mins,) “my peer’s thesis in a nutshell” Join a group of 3 , in 1-2 mins, tell one of your group members, what is his/her research topic and main questions and arguments, and what you like about it. Afterwards, let him/her clarify what you have missed. (This is to make them reflect on how effectively communicated their ideas were.)  Finally, 10 mins of recap and reflect. We will try to keep the activities under 2 hours. The rest of the class time (5-5:45pm) is for individuals who need extra help with technologies related to their presentations or papers.
[3:59 PM] 
* @christine Let me know if you have any other ideas or just suggestions to these activities. We can talk a little more on Friday before or after the scroll-lab meeting (3-4pm), or other time that is suitable for you. Thank you so much!
