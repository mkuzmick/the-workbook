### notes from the instructor: 
#### notes from 20221004 check in
Students already have themes they are supposed to cover in their videos - that’s not what Bridget sent, she said general topics

From Jordan -
We can start out with a conversation on what their goals are and what they want

We should start with an intro to the space, getting them oriented to the LL space.

Themes that they’re going to be making their videos on - all about neanderthals
* One is about diet
* One is about language 
* One is about extinction hypotheses
* One is about social structure/lives/communities

First workshop is on brainstorming
Second workshop is on storyboarding

They’re still figuring out what they know about the topic. But they should have thought enough at this point, they should be imaging what kind of story they want to tell. So yes practicing, thinking about how to make it into a story. This will be the first time they can imagine what it might look like, how they could turn it into a story or video worth watching,

Last time for the first session - they partnered and practiced explaining, and overview of what a storyboard would look like and what they’d put on it. And how to take an academic idea and give it a narrative structure, and tension to resolution 
Second session - they had recorded (bridget was absent) - they layed out their story plans on cards.

We can use the whole course time

Jordan asked about dietary restrictions in case we wanted to do stop motion animation with food. Jordan said we’d def want to go over basics of capturing stuff they will be using so if there is anything they have on hand already that they’d want to practice with. Ie. capturing an object.

Bridget said there are some things they can only capture at the museum that can’t be removed but Bridget could bring some of her own fossils. (DD note maybe we can use a similar HAA move with capturing behind glass)


##### 20227 Consultation Notes from Dani - 
* 20221014:
LL Intro, the idea of recording a video in the space, comfy with overhead cam and tools-explain basic concept from course. 
Potential ASK for Bridget: send us list of concepts they should know by this time
first few weeks, they review the last 300,000 years of human evolution and take an exam
* Weeks 7 & 8 (around October 14 and 21), likely right post lunch.
* MK asked where are the students in their process. So they can practice with a small piece when they’re here.
* From bridget - each student will have a different topic and should already be working on their research paper. Some will have already led a class lecture on their topic. So they definitely should have a concept they can practice explaining.
* For more context - Week 2&3 - they do activities in the natural history museum and talk to visitors to gauge what people generally know and don’t know.
* Technical things they used last time -
    * All of them used LL 2-camera set up. Almost all used card cut outs, talking to camera and moving things around on overhead. And came in for editing sessions. And used open access music. 
* MK asked if we should we spend time helping them make digital versions of the images they want to use?
    * Bridget said the things they’ll be using - Maps, photographs, artifacts (real ones at the museum and casts?) that could be recorded on broll
* MK asked - What differentiates the 2 sessions?
    * From her recollection, the first one was fun practice and being introduced to the LL. Second session just said storyboard and she can’t remember exactly what was done, she may have been out of town that week.
    * MK said the 1st one could be about the very idea of recording, getting comfortable with the overhead camera, explaining just a basic concept from course. The second session they think more specifically about their specific project. (bridget likes this strategy)
    * Bridget has an old storyboard template handout from us
