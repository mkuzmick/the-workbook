### notes from the instructor

The instructors are looking forward to our Canva portfolio workshop sessions at the Learning this upcoming Monday, September 12th at 9am, 10:30am, 12pm, and 1:30pm. Each class session is 60 minutes. 

We are using this class session to do some "housekeeping" and introductions to assignments, etc. in English. Could the instructors conduct the first part independently with students in the small classroom? (approx. 30 minutes). Then, we could move into the larger space where you can help them create their Canva portfolio. For homework, they will have prepared a short written introduction. I would also like them to use this time to record their audio intro and post it on Canva. 

Please let me know if this plan will work and let me know if you have any questions. Class section sizes range from 9 to 17 students. I will not be present, but the instructors of the sections will bring their students. I have attached a sketch PPT of the administrative things that we will review in Part I. 

#### Part I: (in small classroom)
* Warm-up in French
* Quiz discussion
* Study strategies discussion
* "how to use voicethread" intro
* Introduction to Portfolio project and assignment 
#### Part II: (in LL) 
* How to create a Canva Portfolio
* Record their first intro prompt and upload on to their new Canva portfolio.
