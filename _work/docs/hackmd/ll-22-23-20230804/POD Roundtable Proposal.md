# POD Roundtable Proposal 


Teaching and learning centers have been at the vanguard of responding to emergent phenomena: We were central to conceptualizing and implementing remote teaching pedagogy during the Covid-19 pandemic, and more recently, many of us have been asked to help faculty think about best practices and responses to the emergence of AI tools like chatGPT. Teaching and Learning Centers are a key zone for developing the skills of the future that faculty do not currently possess. We continuously ask what knowledge work means, or will come to mean, based on the evidence we gather from students and faculty today.

Our roundtable will discuss the programs and systems we have developed at our teaching and learning center in response to what we see as radical shifts in knowledge work. These programs are one way of thinking about how educational developers can provide support. 

At our center, we have developed future-oriented assignments and activities, as well as the academic support staff that coordinate and build relationships with faculty and other units on campus. Our roundtable speakers will talk about the development of undergraduate and graduate fellowship programs that help students develop critical skills that support faculty who seek to further the possibilities of academic communication and that these students will need in their professional futures. Critically, these fellows programs help us develop more inclusive, student-centered scaffolding activities and assignment guidelines. We will also discuss our center's use of low code/no code (including the use of chatGPT) to design internal systems that help us respond to these continuous, rapid changes in knowledge work. Because they use open-source tools that do not require extensive technical proficiency, these systems could be integrated at institutions with a wide range of resources.
