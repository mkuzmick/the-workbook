# 20221025 HISTSCI1930 20221025 Workshop #2 Plan

## plan 

Part 1: storyboarding
* what do you have already?
* what do you need?
* today is about refining and pushing your podcasts to the next level
* using three different color cards, map out your timeline and the different audio components that will comprise your podcast
    * narration
        * how will you guide your listener through the story your podcasts tells?
    * music bed
        * think about the tone you want to establish
        * how will you structure the listener's experience through music
    * primary data/field audio
        * how does this do something different than the music bed or the narration
        * how does it structure experience
* work in your groups
* share with the other group at your table

Part 2: editing
* garageband
* finding the soundbite
* recording some voiceover
* sourcing music and using music to establish tone
