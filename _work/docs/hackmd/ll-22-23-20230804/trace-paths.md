# trace-paths

We often use 2D animation to show some sort of path whether that be on a map or animating written text, we can show movement from point A to point B.

## the challenge

in Adobe After Effects, create an animation along a line path. The path does not need to be perfectly linear and can be along a curve, it just needs to illustrate movement from one point to another, such as one of the lines on this graph:

(some other examples include a plane path on a map or written text)

## for bonus points

Make the path align to a real scale (ex. data for a line graph); Create multiple paths that start at varying times, such as the graph above or:

## helpful shortcuts 

* A - anchor point
* P - position
* S - scale
* R - rotation
* T - opacity
* Shift - when using pen tool to make straight lines
* , - zoom out
* . - zoom in

## key skills

- use line tool to create shapes/object paths
- add key frames on a timeline
- import media (if importing something to move on the line)
