# Automated Video Compilation for GENED1080

## Background
GENED1080 *How Music Works: Engineering the Acoustical World*, taught by Rob Wood has 91 students students, each producing a video for each project. 

They just turned in an assignment where they created acoustic instruments and then composed an original piece of music using those instruments. The deliverables are videos of them playing their instruments (and some images). They just collected those videos from their first project and [shared those with us](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1btGKfKk9NSV8_PVu16tc1xx4345y6cr2) to give us an idea of what they are working with.
### Project description
We've told Rob that we can work on a prototype of a process for automating a video compilation. Even if we can't figure this an automated process out, the LL will still support a video compilation, even if it has to be done manually.

### Ask
A process for creating a 3-5min clip of highlights, stitching the students' submitted videos together.

## Elements
for testing, could possibly use what Michelle sent us: 

> Here is a link to a google folder that contains all of the videos from the acoustic builds: [(has been added Project Folder)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1btGKfKk9NSV8_PVu16tc1xx4345y6cr2)
> 
> They're roughly separated into folders, and the filenames have been edited to a rough description of the instruments they are, though student creativity knows no bounds.
> 
> Some of the exemplary ones that the TFs have highlighted are:
> Stringed > STRINGKEYFLYWHEEL_45.mp4
> Stringed > DULCIMER_40.mov
> Percussion > GLASSBOTTLES_4.m4v
> Wind > Horn > ALPHORN_98.mp4
> Wind > Flute > TROMBONEFLUTE_96.mp4
> Percussion > Pitched percussion > MUSICALSAW_22.mp4
 
## Tools
* TBD by Jordan?
* maybe Ffmpeg (could be totally random or maybe the loudest moment)?

## Deliverable
They are looking to have a tool in place by 11/22 when their second project is due.

## Timeline
We definitely want to send them an update before 11/22 but no immediate rush.
