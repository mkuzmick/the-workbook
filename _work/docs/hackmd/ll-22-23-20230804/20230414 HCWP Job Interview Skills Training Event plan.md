MK+MW+SC
## plan

STATIONS: 
* Fireplace Room: 
    * vocal and body warm ups
        * must clear space as much as possible in fireplace room for placing down bags and creating space for movement**
* Classroom:
    * practice interview:
        * the preceptors that will be monitoring the students during their practice interview, will sit in the classroom off to the side.   
* Control Room: 
    * feedback: 
        * the preceptors will move from the classroom with the student to the control room to give feedback.
            * and possibly the table that is just outside the room if needed
*  Small Studio: 
    * final interview:
        * The video should only capture the student, not the interviewer. You will hear the interviewer but not see them.

* Main Studio:
    * victory zone:
        * pizza, karaoke, headshots 
        * they will arrange for pizza
