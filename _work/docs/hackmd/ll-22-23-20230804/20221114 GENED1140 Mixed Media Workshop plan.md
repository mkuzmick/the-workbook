1. introduce the forms
2. in small groups - what are the moves each form makes (what are the parts you're hearing/seeing) - do this each for podcast and for video essay
3. share out
4. in small groups - think about why you'd want to use one form versus the other; try to come up with 2 rationales that you'll share with the rest of us
5. share out

### Notes from the instructor: 
**Accommodations: ​​One hearing impaired student who has a transcriptionist that joins them in class and brings a live mic for the presenter so their speech can be transcribed. (other accommodations were vaguely referenced that are not relevant for us like course flexibility)**

* Emailed exception: 
    * Dear Brigitte and Anna,
We are willing to make an exception in this case, but your podcast would need to be 8-10 minutes instead of 5-8 minutes. Keep in mind that asking you to make it longer does not mean just putting in filler or having longer interviews. It requires conceptualizing a podcast that makes sense as a 10 minute segment.
I am copying the Learning Lab folks and our Head TF Elizabeth, so that they know that this is truly exceptional, and that no other group projects have been approved.
Thanks and good luck to you,
Prof. Lewis
### 20221103 Consultation Notes: 
They don’t know how many students are interested in video and podcast (elizabeth said probably more interested in these than mapping)


Christine proposed for the 14th - unpacking a bit of the form. And do a paper prototyping activity, thinking about the structure. The follow up workshops will dive into the specific medium. Elizabeth said Mary really liked whatever was done last year.

They haven’t discussed doing storyboarding - christine she could float doing that with marlon maybe in the later sessions? (or as the paper prototyping activity)

For the subsequent sessions in the LL:
* We can have sign up sheets that we can take a photo of and send back to Elizabeth. 
* Elizabeth has had a few students say they want to use iMovie. Elizabeth said we can just give our own recommendations.
* Elizabeth will add a question to the survey about the software students are interested in using


Each student is meeting with a TF individually about their projects
