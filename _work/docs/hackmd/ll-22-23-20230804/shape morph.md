# shape morph
A common use of 2D animation is visualizing transition. One seamless transition for two objects is morphing one shape into another.


## the challenge
in Adobe After Effects, create an animation of a simple shape morphing into another shape. This can be any two shapes and the transition can be anything you would like: spining, sliding, etc. as long as one shape animates into the other. Here's an example where a triangle morphs into a circle and the accompanying tutorial:

## for bonus points

Transition to a third shape or morph between more complex pictures/icons that have multiple shapes in them (see tutorial)

## helpful shortcuts 

* A - anchor point
* P - position
* S - scale
* R - rotation
* T - opacity
* Shift - when using pen tool to make straight lines
* , - zoom out
* . - zoom in

## key skills
- Building energy/anticipation in animations
- Rotation and position key frames
- Linking objects in animations (parent/child feature)
- Adjusting shape paths to add curve
