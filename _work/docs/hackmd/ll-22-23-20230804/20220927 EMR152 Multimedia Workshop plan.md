### Notes from the instructor:
#### Notes from 20220922 consultation

* where they are in the course: still feels like the beginning!
* the will be transitioning to more of the artistic course from the more conceptual. Will be a mix for the rest of the course
* People are really not sure still what they want to focus on topically, let alone the modality for the final project
    * **So showcasing possibilities - even if you havenâ€™t made a podcast before that is something you can do. Making things seem accessible and doable. What would be the process for doing the projects in a certain form.**
* This week their homework is viewing there is a portal + reading poetic/prose text
* MK asked about theoretical framework/models
    * Stuart hall essay - important framing for whole course
    * Michelle - silences of the past this week - their discussion on this this week got really existential - that will stick with them

#### Notes from 20220922 consultation:
* Storytelling project- encourage students to do something in their own voice. Not a conventional academic essay. Engaging with multiple forms of media. Eleanor is open to podcasts, video, zine. Some students already have project/forms in mind.
* they are looking at There is a Portal. Some live prototyping of things like that - can unpack there is a portal and then students can play around using overhead cameras, green screen, to layer lots of video on top of itself, fun for students to be experimenting that way. Low stakes, no prep in advance, but students kind of live DJing.
