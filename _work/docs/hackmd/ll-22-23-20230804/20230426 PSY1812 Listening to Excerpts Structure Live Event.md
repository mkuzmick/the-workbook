### notes from the instructor
“we came back to the Learning Lab for the last day of class to listen to excerpts of the students’ podcasts. This was done in the studio, where several computers with headphones were available and each computer had one podcast by the students.”

#### back and forth about the zoom speaker (in chronological order top to bottom)
##### M
We had a speaker who could not join us before and would likely join us (via Zoom) for a short period of time. Would that be possible?

##### D
As for the speaker – in what capacity are you hoping for them to join the session? We could launch a zoom from the computer that is connected to the projector, so all of the students could see the speaker on the big screen, but the speaker not be able to see all of the students spread out around the room. We also don’t think there’d be a way for the speaker to get to engage with the podcasts on the various computers. Let us know what you’re thinking!
##### M
For the speaker, it’d be just for chatting, so no need for them to have access to the podcasts. Other than that, the idea will be that the students go around and have a chance to listen to other students’ podcasts.

##### D
Just for a little more clarification –
* is the speaker going to be speaking to the whole class - so the speaker should be projected on the big screen, so all of the students can listen at the same time, and it would be okay for the speaker not to see the students?
* OR should the zoom be set up on an individual computer, so students can walk up to the computer, and chat more one on one with the speaker (and in that case the speaker wouldn’t be projected on the big screen)?
 
##### M
I believe the first option would be better, since the speaker is talking to the whole class. I could also log into zoom using my computer and share that camera on zoom, just to have an option in which she could see someone.
