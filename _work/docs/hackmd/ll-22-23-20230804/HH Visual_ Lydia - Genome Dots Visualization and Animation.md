# HH Visual: Lydia - Genome Dots Visualization and Animation
## the ask:
(one liner description)

Tools: Adobe Illustrator and Keynote



## the context:
* here is the [Scholar's Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKb7SZXXdjAd8hIjghmLISCc417sw-wL)
* in it, you can find the [Scholar's relevant key note slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvtK1H7ECMTfMiUYwHva9lPe0S6GvF6c). These are placeholder slides that you might want as a reference.
* here you can find the [Scholar's run through video for more context and timing reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/145hAK-CCJX7KA6_ymiASec3uRXYPOG7C/view?usp=share_link) . The montage in question happens at the very beginning of the talk.

## the directions:
### for this build...
(insert directions here)
In illustrator, work on assets and make the dots more visible. 
Then it needs to be animated

### when you are wrapping up for the day
* please post in #show-your-work
    * a screenshot at least (if not a final export) of your build in image format
    * in the thread below, share the file (the .blend, .ai, etc) zipped in the thread of that post
    * please tag yourself if you posted from "Learning Lab Studio" so we know who you are!
* even (or especially) if you have a "work in progress" please post! This helps us continue these visuals as a community! You are not on the hook for producing a perfect thing during your worktime - just help nudge this build towards the finish line and we will do the final push!
