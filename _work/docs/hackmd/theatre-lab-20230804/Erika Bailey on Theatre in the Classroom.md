# Erika Bailey on Theatre in the Classroom
Erika Bailey (she/her) is the Head of Voice & Speech at the American Repertory Theatre and teaches voice in the Theatre, Dance, Media concentration at Harvard. In this lecture on Theatre in the Classroom, Bailey invites us to think about the "how" of teaching â€” how do we utilize the body, the voice, and our physical spaces to keep students engaged and teach with presence? She offers lessons from the theatre to help us connect with students as we return to the classroom in a pandemic era.

 

## On "Presence"
What is "presence?" A seemingly magical phenomenon in the  in the theatre world, presence often determines whether or not an actor is memorable. In the classroom, cultivating presence is key in keeping students actively listening and learning. Bailey breaks "presence" down into three components:

1. Commitment to  content
2. Engagement with students 
3. Awareness and use of self

Achieving presence is "a juggling act" of these three components, and when successfully juggling them all, presence is achieved.

## On "Improving Vocal Production"
Bailey offers advice on two physical components of improving vocal production: posture and breathing. She invites awareness of the skeletal system -- a long spine, open back of the neck, and grounded feet. She additionally reminds us of the importance of "low breathing," which effects our ability to project our voice across longer distances.

## On "Speaking to the Back"
When speaking to an audience or group, Bailey invites us to speak directly to the person furthest from you. By speaking to the furthest person in the room, you bring everyone into the loop, and people closer feel involved.

## On "Key Phrases"
Although repetition of content can sometimes feel unnecessary, repeating key phrases helps listeners retain important information. And in a time when our communication is hindered by masks, using visual aids to emphasize key phrases can be helpful.

## On "Accents"
Having an accent is not a hinderance, but a superpower. Be proud of your voice, and if you wan't to help students adjust to your way of speaking, consider adjusting the tempo of your speaking at the beginning of the course.

## Presentation Warm-up
Presentation warm-ups work to awaken the body, use a full range of voice, and practice connecting with an audiece. Bailey leads us through a standard warm-up, including physical exercises, humming, and tongue twisters.

## On "Teaching Persona"
What version of yourself are you as a teacher? Different groups of people need different teachers. Bailey invites us to pay attention to the needs of the people room, think about your character in relationship to who you're teaching, and adjust in order to be the most effective you can be.
