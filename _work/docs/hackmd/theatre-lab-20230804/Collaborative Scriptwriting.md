# Collaborative Scriptwriting

One important element of devised theatre is that there is no one person to create the story. The story unfolds collaboratively. Sometimes these scripts hit a final, fixed version when a consensus is reached, and other times they end up taking the form of a strong structure for improv, including rules and clear goals to guide the story moving forward. These are the most common types of scripts that exist in our everyday encounters. The most successful ensembles (group of collaborators) work to establish shared vocabulary and understanding. They know each other and the content well enough to create improvised scenes on the spot.
