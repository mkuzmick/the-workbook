# Developing Presence 

## What is presence?
If you’ve heard someone talk about “presence,” in reference to a performance, presentation, or even a casual conversation, they are probably referring to a seemingly invisible quality of engagement. Presence can be difficult to define — but easy to spot. 

## When does it matter?

In the theatre world, “presence” is typically referring to stage presence, a normative quality of connecting with not only the audience, but the other actors on stage. Stage presence can, quite simply, be a defining factor in an actor’s success, as it is linked to likability and memorability. Though difficult to pin down exactly what it is that separates an actor with a strong presence to one with a weaker presence, you certainly know it when you see it. While many theatre professionals believe strong presence is a natural ability, others believe it can be taught and developed. 

Of course, presence is valued beyond the stage, and is an important component of everyday performance. Strong stage presence is able to command the attention of one’s peers, take control of a difficult situation, successfully teach a complex concept, or powerfully persuade others. Similar to the role of an actor, presence is a defining factor in a teacher’s success. Giving a lecture can be much like performing a monologue, and keeping students’ attention is just as difficult, if not more, than keeping an audience engaged in a story. But presence is not only useful for teachers — it is a quality that can help students succeed in important peer interactions and difficult conversations with a teacher. 

## Can presence be taught or developed?

Certainly anyone can build a strong presence, though it isn’t as simple as memorizing lines, singing the right notes or smiling the right amount. Developing a strong presence is best achieved through tending to the presence that already lives inside each one of us. We are all born with our own unique presence, and these tools can help amplify that presence in order to demand necessary attention and pull your audience into your message.

## The "juggling act" of presence

According to Theatre Scholar Erika Bailey, maintaining strong presence is like a juggling act — when you juggle it all at once, you are really present. The three elements that we juggle are:

1. Content (committment to what you're doing)
2. Engaging with audience (responding to what they're giving you)
3. Awareness and use of self
