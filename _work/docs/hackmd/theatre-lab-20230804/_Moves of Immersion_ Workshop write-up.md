# "Moves of Immersion" Workshop write-up

In a StoryLab-TheatreLab crossover episode, Jessi led LLUFs through a "moves of immersion" workshop. LLUFs were paired off to create a design proposal for generating immersive experiences in the Learning Lab based on environmental aims generated by Marlon. See the full workshop structure laid out [here.](https://hackmd.io/@theatre-lab/BymZMdhBY) 

## Introduction & Group Conversation

First, Jessi provided definitions of the core concepts we'd be working with (i.e. immersion and immersive experiences) and laid out the learning objectives of the activity:


Then, we started by having a conversation about famous immersive experiences (e.g. Sleep No More, Haunted Houses, Van Gogh Immersion Exhibit) as well as more common immersive experiences (e.g. Hospital Wayfinding, Weddings, Parties). LLUFs shared about the immersive experiences they have had, and we investigated immersion on various scales, as well as considering the kinds of production elements used.

From there, Jessi introduced the "moves of immersion" formula we'd be using for the workshop, showing the end goal of today's workshop with a few examples generated from theatreLab earlier in the week.

## Partnered Mood-boarding

Next, LLUFs were paired off and randomly picked an "environmental aim" generated by Jessi and Marlon. Each pair was asked to create a mood board using images and text on canva slides based on the aim they were given. Each pair was invited to call upon their experiences in spaces where this aim was present, as well as using their imagination to think about the sights, smells, sounds, and feelings that were/are present in these spaces. Most importantly, each pair was invited to think about what kinds of *activities* and/or *actions* were present in these spaces. 

Mood boards:

## Mood Board Share

After creating their initial mood boards, we projected each mood board on the big screen and had each pair talk through their thought process when choosing images and text. We invited the other LLUFs to make comments about the production elements we noticed in the images (i.e. lighting, color, set design, etc.)

## Pairing an Immersive Experience with Environmental Aim

Using their mood boards as inspiration, LLUFs then created an immersive experience to support their aim. These experiences ranged from external actions to internal experiences. The experiences could have ranged to something as mundane as getting students to walk around & explore the whole space, as functional as getting students to gather their own materials, or as creative as getting students to creatively design their own nametag. 

The immersive experiences they came up with were:

* getting students to experiment with familiar tools
* getting students to have easy access to materials
* getting students to randomly choose pre-made design prompts
* getting fellows to feel "zoned-in" on their work without feeling stressed
* getting students to play games during breaks
* getting students to collaborate with someone they have never worked with before
* helping students understand what each space is used for
* getting fellows to contibute to small, easy artifacts that aggregate into an awesome collection
* getting students to participate in a scavenger hunt 


## Brainstorming Production Elements

Once students came up with an experience, they each came up with at least (3) production elements that they could use to facilitate this experience with students. 

## Crafting a Proposal

Once students have settled on a single combination of production elements to facilitate their immersive experiences, they will return to canva to create mood board proposals that include their full formula (environmental aim + immersive experience + production elements). 

Proposals:

***Encouraging risk-taking in design projects by making tools available using a series of catalogs of available tools using a QR code int he studio***

***Making fellows impact visivle in the space by getting fellows to contibute to small, easy artifacts that aggregate into an awesome collection using augmented portraits.

***Creating a sense of chill productivity by having fellows feel zoned-in without feeling stressed using the imac and speakers to stream lo-fi music***

***Creating a sense of play by getting studnets to play games during breaks using window markers and the glass window***

***Fostering understanding for visitors of the Learning Lab by getting students to understand what each space is for using a mission statements that is visible when entering the lab which is verbally reinforced in greetings and goodbyes***

***Encouraging physical exploration of the Learning Lab space by getting visitors to participate in a scavenger hunt using lists & people (as resources and collaborators)***

## Mixing and Matching

After sharing each pair's proposal board, we lined all of our proposals up under the initial formula on the table, and played with mixing and matching cards to demonstrate how no element or experience has one purpose, and the beauty of teasing apart these ideas allows us to plug them in to maximize the use of our production elements.
