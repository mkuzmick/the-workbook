# Turning the Learning Lab into an Immersive Stage

One of the central elements of Immersive Theatre is the physical environment that differs from a traditional theater where audiences sit in seats and watch a show unfurl on a proscenium stage with a curtain. Immersive Theatre instead sets up what is called a "real space." This means that the work unfolding is specific to that space, and is made around its unique features, rather than pretending to be somewhere else. 

## How can we activate the "real space" of the Learning Lab to enhance an immersive theatre experience?

Some ways of getting audiences to feel immersed in the performance is the heighten the senses (e.g. blindfolding audience members to heighten their sense of sound) or facilitate movement. Tailored movement experiences can affect how audiences percieve plot-moving around the space. 

**What if we took the open space of the Learning Lab, and created barriers, pathways, corners, and rooms that invite movement through and between to create a sense of "changing space." We could use curtains, lighting, cameras....**

This might be useful for differentiating between stations in a workshop (being able to adjust the mood, tone, and focus of each station), telling a unique story, or honestly, just having fun...
