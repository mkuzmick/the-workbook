# Jessi's MDF Spring Proposal
This document serves as a living proposal for Jessi's plan for TheatreLab and invidual projects for Spring 2022. The aim of this proposal is not only document initial goals and ideas, but also to suggest a collaboration system for the Spring between Jessi, Marlon, and Christine that will continuously help make connections between the tools/activities of theatrelab and academic benefit/courses that Bok is supporting. 

## TheatreLab Resource Book
Over the spring semester, Jessi will be working on a resource book for bridging theatre tools, concepts, philosophies, and activites into academic settings. This book will consist of four parts:

**1. Academic Performance:** This section will focus on elements of performance to be used in academic performances such as lectures, presentations, podcasts, etc. Each entry will include a definition of the concept, a justification of it's academic benefit, and at least one activity for classroom integration. 

**2. Group Learning & Collaboration:** This section will focus on using collaborative theatre games & prompts to enhance collaborative work in academic spaces. (e.g. collaborative writing, group presentation, idea building, etc.)

**3. Behind the Scenes:** This section will focus on the embedded elements of learning spaces and norms that can be used to enhance the quality of interaction between students, teachers, curriculum, and space. 

**4. Games:**
