# mk-microproject-projection-ratios

screen sizes for quick reference
- 49" from high table to underside of truss => 49x87 => 44" of distance (looks extremely good)
- table width of 96" => 54x96 = 48" distance (this looks good)
- truss width of 132 => 74x132 = 66" distance (this is the limit)
- low table to truss 58" => 

paper based:

48x 85.3 for 16x9
88.8 for 1.85
112 for 2.35
