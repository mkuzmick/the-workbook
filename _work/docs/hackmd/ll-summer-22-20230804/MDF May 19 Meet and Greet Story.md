As a way to collectively look ahead and celebrate the upcoming academic year, the incoming 2022/2023 Media & Design Fellows (MDFs) joined the staff and some Learning Lab Undergraduate Fellows (LLUFs) at the Learning Lab for an informal meet and greet. The meet and greet was a great opportunity to start to build (live and in-person!) the kind of community that is so central to all of our work at the Learning Lab. Building a community around the specific interests, goals, and excitements of our fellows enriches our work and expands our understanding of what's possible in the areas of multimodal and multimedia communication. We'll continue to build our collective during the August MDF orientation.

The meet and greet event also gave us the chance to explore some of the core capacities the Learning Lab has--and that the MDFs can draw on and learn during their time as fellows throughout the next year. The LL team organized four stations around some of the human senses. The "sight" station introduced MDFs to the cameras, switcher, and green screen that we use often in workshops where students use visuals to convey data and claims. At the "touch" station, the MDFs were introduced to the paper, art, and button-making supplies that students use to visualize, present, and make tactile their ideas. The "sound" station comprised different microphones, allowing the MDFs to explore the range of sound qualities that different microphones produce. No meet and greet would be complete without a "taste" station, replete with tons of snacks!

Throughout the event, we captured media that help us to tell the story of all of our fellows--we look forward to continuing to document their ideas, the contributions they make to  teaching and research in their fields, and their creative approach to using media and a range of forms.
