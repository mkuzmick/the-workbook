## TIMELINE

## ideas

* something with the P&P photobooth activity?

* movement in the studio
    * draw the studio space
    * imagine students moving through it
    * think about possible activities for distinct zones:
        * stage
        * main table
        * work tables
        * white boards
        * bonus: music room, other rooms!
* "tour" of the studio
    * given what you've seen in the space so far, how might you give students a 'tour' of the studio? what would you tell them they can do here? present on the stage
        * think about voice and embodiment
* choose a greenscreen background to present in front of
    * what is an MDF riff
    * why do multimodal academic communication riff/what interventions are needed in academic communications and what forms are up to that task?
* some kind of gesture/voice activity
    * what are the moves we make when we explain a concept or idea? 
    * what are the moves we need to make to make our oral presentations effective and engaging?
* combining oral presentation with visual storytelling
    * print a few images related to a multimodal assignment you might assign students in a course in your discipline (or could have mdfs role-play as students in a course, making an argument typical in an introductory class - the kind of tension/resolution exercise we do in Expos, for example)
    * using the overhead camera and presenting to main studio camera, unpack the visuals for us
