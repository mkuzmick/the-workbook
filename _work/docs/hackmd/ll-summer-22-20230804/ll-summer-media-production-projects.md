# ll-summer-media-production-projects

## stills for development office (ASAP!)
- more specific email - "looking for images that represent general colorful classroom teaching materials/methods, learning lab visuals. I saw some photos of sticky notes, drawings, planning materials, maybe the BOK signage things like this that you would have in your photo library. and some background/captions about the photos would be helpful."
- first email for context - "I work in the Alumni Affairs and Development office in the Creative Services department. I am working on a project that I hope you may provide some photography I could use that will be presented to a donor. I am looking for photos of good examples of what you do in the Learning Labs (can have people in to the photos but, Iâ€™m not particularly looking for that kind of photography for this specific project). There were some great photos on the website and in your Annual Report. I am looking for high res photo for print use, if available. Please let me know if you have any questions and if you can help me with this."

## montage of things that happened
- every shoot gets a minimum amount of post production (hero shot, peak gif script), but we identify at the beginning of the week which shoots should get a montage (note for montages - we can either use title cards or sound bite!)
- brainstorming some events we want to make montages of and getting proxy of it
    - NAHSP
    - LL Bok summer seminar
    - story of Horizons (prep + support + practice would be fun to put in the montage)
    - Expos 

## trailers of things we can provide/stories of different parts of the LL
- writing a script or storyboard can be done remote
- shooting in person
- editing could be done remote
- showing weird technical capacity but showing how/why we use it in programming
- brainstorming
    - button making (JK+CD around to be characters)
        - vogue-inspired "us at work in action"
    - unusual use of chroma-keying (sp?)
    - mic taste testing
    - quick tour of the space / playful "the LL in 60 seconds" 
    - LLUFs trailer


## lookbook for media shoots
- adds process around visual brainstorming
- process - ideally we meet with them, get initial ideas. then put together a lookbook (that could involve things we find or things we make as prototypes) and get feedback from them on lookbook, then continue to refine until shoot happens.
- some may be in media production zone, some may be more in mdf zone.
- think about any projects where we know enough to get started on a lookbook for it.
    - ex) puppet theatre course - grabbing bits of video that exist in movies OR making prototypes themselves that could function as proof of concept

## ll-greatest-hits
- we want to have an easily accessible group of videos & stills and other media types that we constantly refer to or reuse for various LL purposes. this includes sample student assignments, video montages of work that we've done for courses, various types of faculty genereated media to comments on student work to course trailers. it includes models that we draw on frequently (like HH, Steve Jobs video). ultimately these should all be stored in an airtable, but there will be media production involved - cutting things together, might have to remove student identities, might even want to record our own interview or voice over to frame something that doesn't make sense without framing, etc
- at some point there will be requests from people about editing specific things to add to this list
- but every single individual has to identify the greatest hits (wanting to hold on to the best stuff they've done)
