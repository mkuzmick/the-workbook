# arianna-explainer-video-oeb-51

teaching course in the spring potentially
could incorporate it into this
teaching with her advisor - Gonzalo Durrabit (sp?)
Arianna as a TA will be in charge of lab session
lab looking at specimens from the natural history museum or looking at live specimans
involves sketching them and learning about them

so you don't come to lab every friday and sketch an animal every friday, wants to make something more engaging or interesting/mix it up a bit

really wants to make an explainer video but isn't sure whether that's practical to include in the course or not; on velvet worms; for the OEB lab's website
* have live animals in the lab - get footage of those
* overhead (including with stop-motion animation)

video that senior thesis writers would make (in addition to their poster sessions) 

OEB51 is the course - something like invertabrate zoology 

modeling with clay or Blender?
spend some time sketching - 2D; is there a week where it would be cool to switch into 3D form? What would motivate that?

aggregation of sketches - put this together into a game or an explainer video that uses all of the sketches or one from each week; gallery; player cards of different specimens

scan the illustrations and bring them into some kind of a layout

drawing exercises for the students; how to do observational drawing - 5-10 minute exercises to introduce students/get them over intimidation of drawing
doing things that are representational versus highly detailed

guess who-style game with the species?! as a section activity 

interests:
bio-geography and distribution of species

## next steps:
arianna finds some models and will share with us
set up another time for her to come in (and look at models)
book time in the space
JK and CD send some resources in the meantime (see above)
* screenprinting for diagramming and layers
* drawing exercises for students
* printing on vellum or pure clear? (just find out whether we can do this)
* send info about MDF program + stories about virtual labs
    * cd to do
* is it possible to hire arianna to do a project for OEB51?
    * in progress - waiting to hear from the prof.
