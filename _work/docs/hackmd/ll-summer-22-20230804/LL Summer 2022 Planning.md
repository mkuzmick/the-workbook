# LL Summer 2022 Planning

## basics

In the summer, we'll work at preparing for the coming year, largely by learning and building new things. It's a great time for solo learning projects if we can connect them to needed products and prototypes, and it's DEFINITELY a great time for collective work on some of the more challenging learning and building tasks.

It is also a GREAT time to take time off, so please please don't think you need to physically be here for each week of the summer---try to take as many of them off for vacation as possible!

We'll think of the summer as running from June 1st to August 12th, and why don't we number the weeks this way?


* week 0: 6.01-6.03 (mk-3, cd-3, jk-3 dd-3, cc-3)
* week 1: 6.06-6.10 (mk-5, cd-5, jk-*1 dd, cc-3)
* week 2: 6.13-6.16 (mk-4, cd-4/5, jk-2*, dd-4, cc-4)
* week 3: 6.21-6.24 (mk-4, cd-4/5, jk-2*, dd, cc-3)
* week 4: 6.27-6.30 (mk-2, cd-3, jk-2* dd, cc-4)
* week 5: 7.05-7.08 (mk-0.2, dd-3, jk-2* cc-0)
* week 6: 7.11-7.15 (mk-0.2, cd, jk-2/2*, cc-5)
* week 7: 7.18-7.22 (mk-5,cd-4/5, jk-3/2*, cc-5)
* week 8: 7.25-7.29 (mk-5, dd, cd-4/5, jk-2/3*, cc-5)
* week 9: 8.01-8.05 (mk-0.2, cd*, dd-4, cc-4)
* week 10: 8.08-8.12 (mk-5, cd-5, dd-4, jk-2/3* cc-5)

 *= working remotely entire week

- we'll use [this HackMD space](https://hackmd.io/team/ll-summer-22?nav=overview) for summer projects, that way we can just shut it down when the summer is done without damaging anything else in the system
    - this operation is one we should get used to if we are going to continue with hackMD, and it will involve solving a few problems
        - coming up with the right sort of destination for the content. Should it be Airtable alone? a combination of Airtable and a Github repo? and should the Github repo be markdown alone or a Nextjs app? etc.
        - handling relative links that point to document IDs within the HackMD system. A key challenge is that all of the docs in the soon-to-be-archived repo will be dead, so they need to be updated. But links to other HackMDs may be able to stay live?
- we'll use [this repository](https://github.com/learninglab-studio/ll-summer-22) to create a next app, markdown content, command line tools, etc.

### planning things for summer

#### 051822 MK, JK, CD, DD

- LLUF - no for sure summer programming. we can have a guest list for folks who around for the summer if we want to do a few random things.
-

##### What we need to be in the studio for
- building the main studio
- building/re-organizing the rest of the 50 church space (getting the other rooms up and running)
    - learning how the new equipment works
    - running cables
    - building support systems for the other rooms
    - lots of storage built in everywhere!
- in-person calendar appointments
    - LL Bok Seminar
    - NAHSP
- tools that are just in the studio


##### Building Prototypes and Resources (can be remote (or in-person if people want)
- creating more handouts for live events (can use this as learning activities and to work collaboratively with staff)
- create a workbook or activity book that could serve as a manual for essentialsLab or some type of basics training (and then staff prototype)
    - ie. intro sequence could be done as a sprint over 1 week
    - write-ups can be done remote for sure
    - look to create an arc/flow
- MDF planning (especially if the summer seminar doesn't take place)
    - could bring in guest LLUFs to test things out (and staff!)
    - workshop ideas and activity ideas (some curating what already exists, and some creating)


##### Systems - perfect remote
* slack, github, airtable, google drive, reporting strategies, ingest workflow
* spaces, labs, workflows
* OUR time and availability
    * staff shifting hours (like JK coming in late and working late once a week)
    * getting fellows more into our space vs. balancing with time we can do workshops
        * Fridays - full days for fellows ? maybe wouldn't affect workshop availability too much


#### next steps - come up with categories of things and also then lists of things
- things that could be done together and also asynchronously
    - casey excited vfx, luke excited about davinci,
- come up with teams that could switch weeks or days
- challenges - setting up spaces (have a week to all learn together, and then the next week take try to do it. most important thing is learning! needs to happen before building/competing)
- structure summer plans that set us up well for storytelling (project launch doc, find models/examples, prototype, etc.)
- Dani can schedule show and tells on Fridays & make sure standups are happening at the beginning of the week (maybe a little later)
- MPAs in W, Th, F typically, and T, W, Th during weeks that have a holiday on Fridays . . . so for staff, earlier in the week is better for working from home

#### deadlines
workable studio space - by the start of the bok seminar (june 6)
full build out - by the time MDFs start (august 15)
