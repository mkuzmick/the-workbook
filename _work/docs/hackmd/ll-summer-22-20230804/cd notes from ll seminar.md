thinking like designers
some courses have students design games but that's not the main way we use games
we think about how we can use game design/techniques game designers use to design a classroom experience, the production of a final assignment, the course overall

theories of game design
* flow state: state of immersion, focus you feel when playing games
* subjective experience of playing a game (graphs) - boredom and anxiety based on level of challenge the player experiences
    * there's a flow channel you want to keep students in - skill level and challenge level are ramping at a rate that keeps them in flow channel, so there skill levels go higher and the challenge level goes higher as well (but not so much that they're too anxious)

activity:
- close-reading/analysis of games
- establish analogies between things that happen in games and things that happen in the classroom
    - extrapolate from that to think about kinds of things you might do in a classroom

game mechanics:
- randomization (dice) - when do you want to create randomization in the classroom? mixing up groups, topics, having a different student speak each time, etc.


Seminar participants thought about how game mechanics like randomization and game design elements like game boards could be used to scaffold toward alternative assignments. One example was from the board game Codenames, which requires players to understand what their partner does/does not know. Thinking about this in the context of an explainer assignment, where students need to explain scientific concepts to learners at different levels, one seminar member discussed how you could adapt that kind of gameplay to help students think about communicating with different learners.

Designing infographics
How does the visual convey something unique
there's a [hackMD for this day](https://hackmd.io/nljurz6qTuKsgEN7nvqyDQ)

process and product
what are the components of multimodal form
what does it allow learners to do, think, struggle through
how do we go about making those
micro-presentation at the end

How to lead discussions on the way to a multimodal assignment - rationale for unpacking podcast

music in podcast // diegetic music in a film (affective, punctuating)

anticipating student questions:
* is the music just pretty and cool? (no! it matters and you should be able to articulate why)
* language for articulating what makes for a good one of these forms a useful prep

analogues to aca writing (analyzing podcast):
* moment of "in this chapter, I will" - set up relationship between voice/narrator and data to be analyzed
* headings, segments, overviews - this tells people what they're going to learn here - like music guidng us between voices

teaching is an elaborate dialogue with students; introducing questions into your form really powerful because this engenders dialogue

what would we want students to notice before going off to make their own (video essay, etc.)

steps of the production process that are "easy" and that produce understanding in a better way than writing an academic paper might:
* find 20 instances of a recurrent motif, bring it to class, and do a micropresentation about it
    * v important to process of developing a video
* identify two sound bites that sum up the most important part of X

RECAP AT THE END - here's what we did!

### rationales:
- thinking about what's happening in the world as a context
- pandemic brought about need for alt assignments
- community-building through alt assignments
- accessibility and inclusion
- have experience with alt assignments as TF
- drawing on what k-12 already does to encourage student creativity
- certain discplines have studnets do the same types of assignments again and again
- retension

### building knowledge
- What do we want students to be able to do with content?
- What do we wants students to do (in order to understand that content in the way you want them to)?
    * summative versus formative assessment

Brainstorm objectives we want in our course
- public-facing
- low barrier to entry for students, inclusive
    - forms that are democratic
- encouraging students to reflect, critique, debate
- develop familiarity with the academic terrain, key terms and concepts in the field
- encourage students to reflect on formal choices (including in unexpected zones; thinking beyond conventional data visualization moves in EPS, for ex.)
- students take an active role in their learning
- students undertake acts of teaching as well as learning (something between memorization and application)
- seeing ideas, concepts, etc. as historically, socially, politically situated
