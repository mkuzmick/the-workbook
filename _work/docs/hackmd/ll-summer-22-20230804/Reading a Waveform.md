# Reading a Waveform

A waveform is a visual representation of audio, displaying amplitude or level changes over time. If the X-axis of the graph is the audio over time then the Y-axis shows the amplitude or volume of said audio. 

Being able to read a waveform is helpful for visually pinpointing problem areas in audio like uneven volume levels as well as clicks and pops. 

When reading a stereo waveform the upper waveform represents the left channel and the lower waveform represents the right channel.
