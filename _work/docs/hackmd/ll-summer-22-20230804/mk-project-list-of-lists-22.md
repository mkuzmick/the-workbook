ok. with the above lists in mind, let’s work at drafting some potential cluster.
* we should precisely NOT follow the divisions of the liberal arts (per se), because this is what happens in the curriculum  . . . we want to target tools and moves that run across the disciplines (and are other than them), because this is where we find a market opportunity.
* one could also argue that teachers should focus on tools (while the critic focuses on forms and genres)
