# mk-notes-for-mdf-orientation

- mdf notes
    - think about what students will be doing (i.e. we won't lecture during this hour: students will listen to the lecture (and perhaps take notes) during this hour). How this little reframing helps
    - exam = evidence of mastery; studying = method for learning. The nice thing about essays is that the writing is the learning and the evidence.
