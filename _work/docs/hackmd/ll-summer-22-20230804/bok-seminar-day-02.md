## activity 1: unpacking the machine
Let's consider what multimodal forms like podcasts can do (and that academic writing can't do). Let's take apart the machine and think about what the "machine" of the podcast enables for learners.

To do this, we can consider:
* How a podcast conveys data to the listener
* What the different components of the podcast are
* How its structure differs from the conventional moves of academic writing

Listening to an excerpt from the beginning of the podcast Serial, let's try to isolate the different components, reflecting on the functional role they play. 

Let's do the same with a video essay.

Having spent some time unpacking a model, we can brainstorm ways to make (and, specifically, to teach making) a podcast.

What are some activities that would help students create a multimodal assignment like a podcast or a video essay? If you had to make something like these video essays, how many steps do you think would be involved in that? How would you get them started on that?

## activity 2: making with the machine
We use cameras and mics a lot here at the LL! Using our studio equipment, let's learn a bit about how these machines work! Understanding even the basic functions of cameras and mics is really useful as you embark on designing an alternative assignment that uses these tools.

Let's reflect on the techincal skills involved in making using a tool: What does using these "machines" allow for you as teachers and for learners?

Once you've had the experience of analyzing the "machine" of podcasts and video essays and doing a bit with the tools, let's make explainer-style videos where we reflect on what we've learned.

## notes

what are the components of the podcast?
* recording/collect call
* narrator/voiceover
* music bed

video essay:
* visual motifs
* speed
* we see the pattern ourselves and then "think with" the video narrator about the chair
