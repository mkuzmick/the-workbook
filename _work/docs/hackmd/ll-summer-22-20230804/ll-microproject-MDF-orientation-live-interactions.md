## TIMELINE
Tuesday 23rd: 9:00 - 10:30 

## ideas

* in small groups, develop a manifesto arguing for a lab or working group. deliver your manifesto on the stage and build lab consciousness!

* analyze a board game
    * what are the mechanics? play a few turns
    * how could you adapt these mechanics for an in-class activity?
* design a game for students to play (we role play as students in this scenario)
    * make an icebreaker activity and test it on all of us
        * could make use of the PA system for this
    * something with the matrix grids JK has talked about?
    * design a challenge/mission for students (including LLUFs!) to play that also gets them started on a multimodal assignment
        * defamiliarization exercise with 20 photographs
        * try to capture good audio in a not ideal environment (outside)
* share your ideas in front of the group
    * tips for helping students feel confident enough to present on the stage
    * what strategies can we give to students that encourages their participation in sharing exercises?
* game board design for the multimodal assignment
    * making some kind of a game board layout on the main table that moves students through the different steps of the design process
    * gamify it - build in some hiccups that occur during the process, or have students do different activities as they go?
