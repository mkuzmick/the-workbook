        * anything else?
* part 2: MDFs, assignment design and academic communication
    * what IS an alternative assignment anyway? alternative to what? how?
    * the future of academic communication
    * the “moves that matter” in your discipline
    * examples of past projects from Horizons to the typical podcast assignment
    * the role of assignment design & academic communication in the role (why we're spending so much time on them during this orientation)
    * alternative to what? discussion? models and inspirations?
    * basics of assignment design?
    * putting these two things into dialogue
    * basic terms and concepts: backward design, alignment, formative and summative assessment, scaffolding


10:30 - 12:
* deeper dive into academic communication on the one side and multimodal assignments on the other--working towards a rationale that connects one to the other
    * close reading of a chunk of academic communication (like an article)
        * go find something on an iMac, post to Slack channel X
    * identify some of the "moves" that matter, that demonstrate knowledge and expertise 
        * potentially even some moves that push at the boundaries of text or reveal its limitations
    * let's try to think of an assignment that could be in alignment with one of these moves and create a rationale
        * deliver in small studio or look at whiteboard in studio?


12 - 1: 
* working lunch - tool landscape

1:30 - 3:45 (optional): 
* capturing audio, video, photo
* tools: cameras + lenses, mics, lights

**Wednesday, August 17**

1:30 - 3:45 (optional): 
* work time in the LL studio


**Thursday, August 18
Multimodal Storytelling: the Products and the Processes**

9 - 10:30: (PRODUCT)
* disassemble the product
    * what are all the parts of X?
* disassemble the process
    * what are all the steps in making X?
    * how can we LEARN from these steps?
* examples: 
    * writing assignments from Expos, say, as examples of the known
    * podcasting, photo and video assignments and the many steps involved in making them

10:30 - 12: (PROCESS)
* now let's actually MAKE something we talked about in the first part of the day
    * maybe a photomontage
    * a short film
    * a podcast
    * a 3d model
    * a poster
    * etc
* reflect on the steps
* what do we learn through these steps? anything unexpected? could the steps themselves teach us something about subject matter? (so that we aren't just doing disconnected "skills training" that's only a means to an end?)

tools: keynote, canva, iD

12 - 1: 
* working lunch: headshots + buttons

1:30 - 3:45 (optional):

Live Interactions and Experiences, Learning the Studio Machine**
    - or interaction, experience, performance
    - the theatre of the classroom
    - LL experiences as interactive theatre
    - how to lead a workshop
    - how to make use of the whole machine and its mechanics
    - what do they design?
    - also the basic idea of borrowing from adjacent worlds (theatre and game design) rather than merely educational technology, digital humanities and instructional design
- so, when you want to lead a workshop (for the stuff you are assigning based on last week), you are designing an experience (often one here in the LL)--today let's work at this together, borrowing from the highest-level worlds of experience design (games and theatre)

9 - 10:30 and 10:30 - 12:
* learning from the worlds of theatre and game design
* designing low-stakes in-class activities and higher-stakes performance assignments
    * "gamifying" low stakes scaffolding assignments (mechanics from games)
    * game pieces
    * cards
    * game boards
    * spaces and patterns of movement
* doing a live show
    * pa system
    * lighting
    * greenscreen
    * cameras
    * projection
    * multiple spaces
* the workshop as collaborative theatre
    * designing an arc
    * what do you want students to be able to do?
        

* get media assets for lookbooks?

12 - 1: working lunch: something with the PA system?; tension/resolution with pitch for alt assignment in your field 

1:30 - 2:30 (strongly encouraged):

### What we'll do at orientation:
At orientation, we'll get to know each other, and we'll start to design possible multimodal assignments and activities that are in alignment with your discipline's methods and modes of communicating scholarship. We'll talk about some of the fundamentals of assignment design and how to develop rationales for assignments that resonate both with faculty and with students. We are really excited to draw on your academic expertise as we think about what specific multimodal/multimedia forms make sense for your disciplines.

Don't worry at all if you haven't had the chance yet to talk with anyone in your department about possible multimodal assignments! Orientation will allow all of us to get ready for the new academic year together and to develop shared capacities that will serve you in your time as an MDF and in your future careers. (We'll also design materials together that you'll be able to share with your departments!) 

Together, we'll draw on the many resources we have here at the Learning Lab and think about how to make the best use of them for your current and/or future projects.
