# ll-microproject-MDF-orientation-grading-and-responding

## TIMELINE
Thursday 25th: 9:00 - 10:30 

## ideas

* discuss [some Bok resources about feedback and assessment](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/grading-and-responding-student-work) like we did in Bok seminar
* exercise where we analyze a rubric? Or make rubrics based on learning objectives they've defined in week 1
    * discuss: what are the most important components of a multimodal assignment to assess?
    * give the mdfs , say, a video essay ask them to assess it? (one great one, one not so great one - both from vox or something so it's publicly accessible and shows the importance of assessing models, even those professionally produced!)
* giving students feedback in a multimodal form activity
    * on camera assessment - you react to students' work in "live time"
    * maybe for this we'd have the mdf reflect on something they made at the start of orientation and reflect on what's changed or what's happening, for instance, in a video they're seeing (almost like jessi's hdp interviews?)
        * or what they've learned in the process that would make them revise what they made in week 1 (this could be a cool way to return to the "what is an mdf" question - they answer it one day 1 and last day); so they'd watch their original riff and assess it in this activity
        * or they could assess any of the oral presentations they do on camera - so we'd need to make assets for this, get a reel ready for them?
