# ll-microproject-MDF-orientation-3D-and-animation

## TIMELINE
Thursday 18th: 1:30 - 3:45
## IDEAS

* annotated object activity? make your name and department in 3d letters, bring in intentionally chosen object from sketchfab (could be an asset that they bring into their lookbooks?)
    * render as an animation and turn into a gif and upload to slack
* intro title sequence

Could we do the woorkflow that produces this?!...:
> Zibby drew it, I did the quickest of all possible background-removals in Ps (hoping for something that can be turned into an action) and then it's off to Blender to animate a simple plane or more complex rig. I like the way the sun crosses the line at the bottom where Z colored outside the lines.
Anyway---what's cool I think is that a whole bunch of this workflow could be automated, and that means that on a fast enough machine, LL guests could get on-the-spot epic 3D renderings of drawings, animation prototypes, etc

blender shortcuts:
- 'G' is Grab, it attaches the object to the mouse and you click to drop it.
- 'R' is Rotate, it attaches the object to the mouse and you can spin it around; click to finalize position.
- 'R' or 'G' with X, Y, Z lets you rotate or move on a particular axis.
- 'S' is scale, swipe up and down the mouse to make object bigger or smaller, click to finalize position. 
- 'Ctrl + P' is parent, select both objects you would like to link before
- Use 'tab' to switch between object and edit modes
