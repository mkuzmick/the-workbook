# Apple Loops (Logic / Garageband only)

Logic Pro X and Garageband come with a multitude of prerecorded musical ideas that can be dragged and dropped into your project. When Apple Loops are dropped in a project, they will adjust to the current project key and tempo, allowing you to combine different loops.

Apple Loops are found in the Loop Browser and are tagged by instrument, genre, and other descriptors. To open the Loop Browser, press **[O]** on the keyboard or click the Loop Browser Button in the top right of the Control Bar.

**There are four types of Apple Loops:**

- Audio loops (blue) can be edited just like other Audio regions

- Software instrument loops (green) can be edited just like other MIDI regions.

- Drummer loops (yellow) contain a variety virtual drummers. Drummer can respond interactively to other tracks and regions in a project.

- Pattern loops (yellow) contain all information from a pattern created using the Step Sequencer. Pattern loop notes can be edited in the Step Sequencer.
