Multimodal Communication: Process + Product**

In this session, we’ll explore the fundamentals of multimodal communication, emphasizing the process of designing and creating multimodal forms. First, we’ll consider the learning objectives that are important in your disciplines and from there, we’ll design multimodal assignments or activities that are in alignment with those objectives. You’ll also get a taste of some of the most essential tools we use here at the Learning Lab for visual communication workshops and activities: cameras and microphones!

9 – 9:30: coffee + introductions

9:30 – 10: 30: the future of academic communication: from text to ____ , motivations for multimodal communication, backward design, the “moves that matter” in your discipline
Tools: cards + brush pens; readings that MDFs bring in?

10:30 – 10:45: break

10: 45 – 12: unpacking audio/visual examples, speaking with images/visual storytelling
Tools: mics + cameras

12 – 1: lunch (provided)
*use lunch to get them set up on systems like Slack, etc.? Or do this earlier in the day?

Visual Storytelling + Documentation, Menus/Lookbooks**

As Media & Design Fellows, you are uniquely positioned to know: 
* what multimodal forms are best suited to convey and cultivate your discipline’s knowledge
* how to communicate to your department what these multimodal forms are and how they might be integrated into specific courses 

Today, we’ll start the process of developing multimedia menus—or lookbooks or pitch decks—that you can share with faculty in your department. These menus provide an overview of the types of multimodal projects that you can support as an MDF—and that make sense from an academic perspective, given what you know as experts in your domain. Like all multimodal projects, these menus are intentionally designed so that in their very form, they show what multimedia forms can achieve that text alone cannot. Designing these menus will also give us a chance to collectively explore the multimedia essay—a form that addresses the learning objectives of a range of disciplines. 

9 – 9:30: coffee

9:30 – 10: 30: developing + explaining rationales for multimodal assignments
Tools: cards + brush pens; cameras + mics

10:30 – 10:45: break

10: 45 – 12: the principles of graphic design (or something with photography/image processing?)
Tools: InDesign, Canva, HackMD?

12 – 1: lunch (provided)

Live Interactions and Experiences**

Whether you’re in the classroom, hosting a workshop at the Learning Lab, or presenting your own research findings, you engage others through the use of gesture, your voice, and the tools available to you (say, the microphones in the LL or a projector in a classroom). Today, we’ll explore ways of designing dynamic, inclusive, interactive learning experiences, helping us and our students develop our communication skills. We’ll also learn about some of the core “moves” of the LL studio—the keys to this space are yours as MDFs, and the possibilities for instruction here are practically endless! 

9 – 9:30: coffee

9:30 – 10: 30: the classroom/LL studio as stage, performance techniques and mechanics  
Tools: the body, cameras + mics, green screen?

10:30 – 10:45: break

10: 45 – 12: game design and learning activities
Tools: : the body, cameras + mics, green screen?

12 – 1: lunch (provided)

Assessing, Documenting, Collecting, Celebrating Student Work**

Documentation is essential to everything we do here at the LL. As MDFs, you’ll document your projects throughout the year, tracking the process of developing multimodal assignments, resources, and activities, and reflecting on what you learn along the way. This kind of metacognitive practice is essential when creating in unfamiliar forms and tools, and students are often asked to turn in reflective essays of this sort when submitting a multimodal assignment. It’s also a great way to share your learning with a broader audience, who stand to gain significantly from what you’ve gleaned through experience. Today, we’ll think through some of the ways to create multimedia documentation, as well as how we might assess multimodal assignments (or advise instructors on how to do so). We’ll also design end-of-term celebratory events that can give students a chance to share their multimodal projects with their friends and professors—an important way that we can recognize the unique challenges and successes that students working in multimodal forms for the first time often experience.

9 – 9:30: coffee

9:30 – 10: 30: documenting and collecting student work; assessment?
Tools: HackMD, some database?

10:30 – 10:45: break

10: 45 – 12: designing an end-of-semester event for your students
Tools: FCPX for montages, web-based gallery tool (HackMD? Canva?), buttons + paper 

12 – 1: lunch (provided)

Ideas for MWF or optional T/Th. afternoon sessions:
* Check-in w/us to finalize their project launch docs (because we’re sending these back to departments by the end of the month)
* deeper dives into the tools
    * Blender/Designing assets that students might use
    * Coding (maybe getting some templates ready for virtual galleries and/or web-based multimedia essays?)
    * filmmaking assignments
    * scalar, visual essays, 
    * keep in mind what we want specific staff to help out with (ex. Luke & Casey)
    * canva, indesign, 

Questions:
* Draft of menu by end of week 1; final by end of week 2? (with comments from us along the way?)
* Have one workshop “pitch” by end of orientation, ready to start coordinating with dept/specific course?
* How to convey to MDFs fundamentals of coordinating an event/workshop? Make a handout that can help them know where to start?
