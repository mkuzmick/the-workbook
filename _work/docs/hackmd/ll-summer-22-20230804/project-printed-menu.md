        - data needs to be current and far too specific and large-scale to be done by hand
        - but certain moves and mechanics, operations performed on the bits of information/cards ARE predictable and repeated, and the scale of reproduction you achieve with older-school printing methods is actually ideal for the groups we typically deal with.
