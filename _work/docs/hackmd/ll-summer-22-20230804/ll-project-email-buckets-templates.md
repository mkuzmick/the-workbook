## button requests from student groups etc.
Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately our button makers are mainly for internal use and we don’t have the materials or bandwidth to make them at scale.

## for groups reaching out for a collaboration that is beyond course support
Thanks so much for reaching out! This sounds really cool. 

Just for context, the Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students. However, in certain instances, we may be able to provide support if a partnership would contribute to our mission of supporting undergraduate student education. 

We’re excited about the potential of working with your group, but can you fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrlL2LycUrsxV4W5) first to provide us with some more information? In particular, those 1-2 paragraphs on why we should be able to support this (using the framing text below the question, which should help guide you in your response) will be essential in us determining if we can collaborate.

Let me know if you have any questions!

All best,
Dani

## borrowing gear request
Hi, 

Thanks for getting in touch with the LL! Can you tell me a bit more about what you’re trying to capture / what gear you’d like to borrow and when?

All best,

## P&P "observation" classroom recording request to the LL
Unfortunately this is not a service the Learning Lab provides. We’re not a technology center that has the capacity to lend out equipment - for context, the Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses that are creating unconventional and multimodal assignments for their students, and then we work to support those students (and we have a very limited amount of equipment that we may lend out for these purposes).

It sounds like [ESS](https://ess.fas.harvard.edu/lecture-capture-and-class-recording), [Lamont Media Lab](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/lamont-multimedia-lab) or [Cabot Media Studios](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/cabot-media-studios) might be what you’re looking for (if you don’t want to review your video with a Bok Center consultant). I’ve CC’ed my colleagues, Grace Gomez and Adam Beaver, who run the Bok Center’s classroom observation program, who are the best people to direct your questions to. They should be able to help you!

## returning gear emails
Hi, 

Yes you can definitely swing by the LL to return the gear! We are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, so any time during that window works!

All best,

## student group requests
### option 1
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out! We mostly only have the capacity to help students in courses we’re supporting, but we do have some limited bandwidth to help out with student projects. Can you let us know more specifically what resources you’re looking for? 
 
All best,
The Learning Lab

### option 1.5
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out. The Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. Can you give us more information about your project and the course/professor it’s for? Alternatively, it may be useful to check out Harvard Library’s Tech Loan program: https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/tech-loan.


All best,

Dani


### option 2 
Hi,

We have a limited bandwidth to work with student groups that overlap with our mission. So while we’d probably be unable to collaborate on every video with you, we would love to have you come in for a meeting to talk about your projects and brainstorm which of them we could support and the kind of support we could provide. 

Please let us know if you’d be interested in coming in to discuss, and if there are times that work well for you.

All best,

### option 3 (when we already know we want to help)
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out. The Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. Can you give us more information about your project and the course number + name and professor it’s for? 

If you can give us that information, I may be able to book time in our small studio for you if we have availability. Please also let me know some date and time options that would work for you, and how much time you’ll need to record.
 
Thanks so much!

All best,

## sending footage after class visit
