Luke's Guide:
#### Getting Started 
Editing video often comes down to ones particular goal or misson they have in mind. What I mean to say is that editing is not as cut and dry as simply pasting clips together in a select sequence, although at times it can be that simple. More often than not video editing serves as a tool to tell a story, or convey a message. As such I've comprised some examples of different ways video eding is used to tell different types of stories or messages that may be useful to you as you begin your video editing journey.
