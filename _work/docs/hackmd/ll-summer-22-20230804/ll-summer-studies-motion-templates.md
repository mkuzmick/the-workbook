Two clips that are connected somehow, want them in the same position relative to each other (like the student explaining their artwork/analysis video)

Final Cut Effect
don't worry about ppreset and frame rates - only changing size of things so no need

Effect Source: footage that's dropped in to final cut
Make effect source box smaller
can do this in inspector - like FCPX, but everything is on the left (including inspector
)

Scale - 47 percent
Add in some text (T button in the timeline)
label it 47 percent
make font editable but not text
Any paramet you want visible in fcpx - click publish in drop down next to font in the parameters
File > save as > cd-47-left-with-text
new category > cd demos
theme > example
Hit publish

go to fcpx
look in effects
now there should be cd demos in there
drag it on to a clip and it should automatically resize the 


Object > new drop zone
resize 
Save again (see above)
in fcpx - can drag the clip into the drop zone once you pull up the effect again

adding keyframes to position 
keyframing better in motion than in fcpx

adding behavior - other way to make things move
*make sure library (not inspector) selected to pull up behavior options
basic motion the easiest to understand
motion path - applied to effect source - it'll go along that path for the duration of the motion path behavior

Simulations (behavior)
apply to effect source (i.e., a vortex)
these work best with a lot of different drop zones

DROP ZONES BEST FOR GIFS, not for hour long clips

use this to make a kind of obs set up
