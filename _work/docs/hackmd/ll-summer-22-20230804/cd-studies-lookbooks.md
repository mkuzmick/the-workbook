# cd-studies-lookbooks

### form
lookbooks give a sense of the aesthetics and overall feel/tone of a particular project (i.e., a film)

lookbooks can function as answers to questions ordinarily posed at the outset of a project:
* what do I want this to look like
* what choices do I have to make in terms of color, composition, lenses, etc. in order to achieve a certain effect
* what is the effect of bringing together an array of elements 
* (if thinking about this in the context of a multimodal assignment lookbook: what does this form enable)

### questions:
How many examples do we want?
any difference between lookbook and "menu" in terms of form?
