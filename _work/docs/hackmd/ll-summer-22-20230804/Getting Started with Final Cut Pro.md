# Getting Started with Final Cut Pro #
![](https://i.imgur.com/1aXBNgx.jpg)




### Step 1: Setup and Storage ###


At the Learning Lab we like to setup our Folder structure outside of Final Cut Pro first before creating a Final Cut Library. 
* Open Finder and navigate to your desired storage location.
* Create a Folder and rename it to your desired Project or shoot. (ex. Final_Cut_Tutorial)

### Step 2: Editing
Now that we have Lightroom setup we can start editing. I should note, that this tutorial will only cover the basics, but I will leave links to in-depth tutorials at the end of this document. 

* Click on Develop ![](https://i.imgur.com/fv7AKnd.jpg)
* This is where we will be doing our editing. On the right is our controls. We're only going to focus on the "**Basic**" section![](https://i.imgur.com/CuBd3zG.jpg)
    
    * At the top, you'll notice **Temp** and **Tint**, these are very self-explanatory. The **Temp** slider controls how warm or cold the image is, and the **Tint** controls how green or red the image is. These two sliders are the basic foundations of your image's white balance. For this image, the white balance is fairly good although you could warm up the image or cool it to your preference. For right now we'll leave it as is. 
    * The second set of sliders control the images **Brightness and Contrast.** **Exposure** pertains to how bright the image is overall, and **Contrast** controls the level of contrast in the image. A good way to think of Contrast is that this slider when turned up makes the black areas "blacker" and the white areas "whiter". It's not necessarily brightness, however, a higher contrast image will appear to be more saturated and brighter because of this concept. 
        * The next sliders all control individual areas of the image. **Highlights** control the brighter parts, **Shadows** control the darker, **Whites** control how intensely bright the white parts are, and **Blacks** control how intensely dark the image is. 
    * The next set of sliders control the **Presence** of an image. Presence is a little harder to define, so let's break it down by each individual slider in this section
        * **Texture** functions to bring out the detail in the lesser or mid-frequency parts of your image. Essentially giving you the option of adding or decreasing the level of detail on a smaller/less intensive scale.
        * **Clarity** on the other hand is a far harsher tool. It serves to increase the level of detail by increasing or decreasing contrast in the image's edges or harsher areas of the image. So an increase can make for a very harsh-looking scene, whereas a decrease can give a dreamy effect. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ld8KhYq.jpg)

        * **Dehaze** is more straightforward, this slider controls how hazy the image is. So if you have a very foggy-looking image increasing the slider will cut down the fog and vice versa. 
    * The last set of sliders controls the **Vibrance** and **Saturation** levels of the image. You might be wondering what the difference is. **Vibrance** refers more to skin tones, making them look more or less saturated, but doesn't have as strong of an effect as **Saturation** does. **Saturation** controls, well saturation --- how bold and rich the overall color of the image is. 

* Lastly let's take a look at the **Crop** tool. In my opinion, this is one of the more important tools.![](https://i.imgur.com/f31C36G.jpg)
 
    * The **Crop** tool lets you crop, straighten, or change the aspect ratio of your image. It's incredibly useful for fixing your composition. This particular image is a little bit off center, so I've gone ahead and fixed it by cropping in on the photo a little. ![](https://i.imgur.com/koy9msL.jpg)
* Now that we know what our Basic tools do, we can edit our image to look something like this: 
    * ***Before*** ![](https://i.imgur.com/msnc3WH.jpg)
    * ***After***![](https://i.imgur.com/lKwhSCE.jpg)
Congratulations, you have successfully edited your first image!

### Step 3: Exporting your image
* Click File -> Export![](https://i.imgur.com/ciVxJJe.jpg)
* Choose the location or create a new folder where you want the export to be saved. Rename your export, and make sure you select the correct file type. I tend to select jpg and set the maximum quality slider to 100%. I also like to leave the resolution at 300.![](https://i.imgur.com/RIzQG9h.jpg)



* And you're done! You can now find your image inside the export location you specified earlier.
