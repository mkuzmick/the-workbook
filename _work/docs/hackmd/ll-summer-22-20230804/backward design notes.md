# backward design notes

* Form follows function: think about the desired results and think about methods and materials from there
* Need to have a clear idea of the end goals/result to do this
* Need to be able to state clearly what we want students to be able to understand and be able to do - this is the baseline or starting point of any plan
* The conventional way of approaching teaching is to think about what/how to teach content
* But backward design focuses first on the learning objectives for students and then thinks about how best to meet those objectives
* It’s about defining what understanding and learning we are actually after - what do we really want students to be able to know and do, especially on their own and with confidence and authority after the course?
* Content, methods, and activities then follow from this specific view of what goals we have for our students 
* Over-emphasis on INPUTS - activities, readings/content we like; under-emphasis on OUTPUT (which is the thing that demonstrates learning at a deep level, the results of, say, taking a course)
* What do students need to succeed in a course or to demonstrate proficiency in a discipline? (Not just about what do they literally need to do in the course)
* "CLEAR INSIGHT INTO LARGER PURPOSES" - there’s something kind of utopian in this! What are our biggest hopes for our students? What do we really want them to learn how to do, beyond the course, assignments, activities?
* What should students understand as a result of their experiences of the course (whether through course content, activities, assignments)? How should activities be structured therefore? How would you measure whether students are on the way to this ideal understanding (via formative assessments presumably)
* What does it look like for students to MEET the GOALS 
* What counts as demonstrating "COMMAND IN THE FIELD" - not just in the drills that constitute course performances in conventional classroom settings
* We want students to be able to "PERFORM WITH UNDERSTANDING," independently/without the course guiding them and measuring their ability through summative assessments for instance - this level of understanding cultivates a type of autonomy that really is only possible through deep learning and understanding, learning to learn and apply what they’ve learned consistently, over time
