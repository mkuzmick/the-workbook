## prompts

### web-based visual essay about a video game
Choose a video game that tells a story of some kind and consider how it tells this story:
* What formal elements of the game (e.g., character interactions, settings, dialogue, camera movement, etc.) allow you, the player, to construct and/or understand the game's narrative? 

Create a web-based visual essay that uses images, gifs, and text to reflect on a game of your choosing.

### game design in Blender and Unity

#### design a micro-game level
In Blender, draw a maze and then extrude it. Port it into Unity and drop a character into it to see how it works during game play. Reflect on your choices in a short paragraph or two:
* What steps did you take to create your maze?
* What challenges did you face when you did so?
* How did you imagine a character interacting with what you made?

#### design a character option:
In Blender, design a character. Reflect on your choices in a short paragraph or two, maybe even annotating in Blender if you want to experiment with the text functions:
* How did you design this character? What features of Blender did you use to make the different features of your character?
* What features did you want in a character? Why? 
* What were the challenges you faced as you designed a character?
