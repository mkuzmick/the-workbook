## CHUNKS/MAP

THESE THINGS ARE TIME CONSUMING AND HARD TO MAKE. HOW DO WE PREPARE STUDENTS TO DO THE PROCESS OF MAKING THESE THINGS?

LET'S GET TO HACKMD IN HERE

**10:30 - 10:50: discussion scaffolding as part of the process** (CD)
could integrate hackmd here/getting them to draft some sample prompts/activities for students

it's going to take a lot of time to get you and students ready to do these kind of things

how can we spend that time well

**ADD THE BELOW AND REVISE ACTIVITIES 1 AND 2**
* rotation where you go through series of things 
* then come back and think through elements of the process that can be valuable in unexpected ways for learning process
* and how we can integrate them into instructional design

What are some activities that would help students create a multimodal assignment like a podcast or a video essay? If you had to make something like these video essays, how many steps do you think would be involved in that? How would you get them started?


**10: 50 - 11:10 activity: making with the machine** (all of us at two stations)
We use cameras and mics a lot here at the LL! Using our studio equipment, let's learn a bit about how these machines work! Understanding even the basic functions of cameras and mics is really useful as you embark on designing an alternative assignment that uses these tools.

**11:10 - 11:20: quick discussion** (CD)
Let's reflect on the techincal skills involved in making using a tool: What does using these "machines" allow for you as teachers and for learners?

**11:30 - 11:50: activity in small studio**
WALK THROUGH YOUR SCAFFOLDING PROCESS IN SMALL STUDIO

OR PUT SOMETHING INTO A VISUAL FORM - INFOGRAPHIC OR VISUALS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING

STEVE JOBS/GRAPHIC DESIGN STUFF?

LOOKBOOKS AS MODELS

Once you've had the experience of analyzing the "machine" of podcasts and video essays and doing a bit with the tools, let's make explainer-style videos where we reflect on what we've learned.

## ideas
* pinterest/canva activity - post screenshots to a canva site on the way to making a lookbook in week 2
* say something about their own work and what they aspire to do that might go beyond conventional academic writing
    * pull stuff from this that makes them look awesome
    * tie to the photobooth mechanic
    * get a still of everyone from this with a great pull quote
* could be cool to do some kind of activity based on what mdfs find model-wise (as they learn from existing models of multimodal communications, they'd try to recreate one or two elements that they see in those models)
    * capturing a possible media asset in small groups using their phones
    * using the overhead camera to do a low-tech explainer-style video 
    * defamiliarizing exercise (take 20 photos of one object) to emphasize the formal properties/compositional elements of photographs; printing and sharing some examples under overhead camera
    * create a multimodal assignment sheet using Canva (what's the form you're going to have students work in, what learning objectives does the assignment address, what activities would help students get to the point where they could make this thing, what design choices can you make to get students excited about this project - reflect on this as you tell us about your alternative assignment sheet)
    * some kind of pinterest activity on the way to capture - make a moodboard of the inspirations that would help you teach students how to find models, what a good model consists of, why to look closely at models
* "process" stations with different tools and challenges? we could give them assets for some of these (e.g., video essays)
    * 3d modeling: annotated object or make your name and mdf title in 3d text
    * video essay: make a 30-second montage
    * infographics: visually represent a key term or concept in your discipline
        * nancy duerte argument structure shapes as a guide (could even make these into larger buttons that we tack on the white boards)
* metacognition on camera: what did you learn by doing some of the steps involved in this process? what was unexpected? challenging? exciting?
