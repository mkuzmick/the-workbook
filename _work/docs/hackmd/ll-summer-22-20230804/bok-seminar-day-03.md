## activity 1: graphic design principles

What are the principles of graphic design? 

Let's think about visual design and how visuals communicate by analyzing the video below, where Steve Jobs introduces the iPad.

## activity 2: making visuals
Now that we've thought about how visual elements can convey key information (and make arguments) to viewers, we should experience what it's like to actually make visuals using a couple of different tools.

In Photoshop--an industry-standard tool that Harvard students have free access to--we'll design posters of ourselves. Let's bring in a photo of ourselves, edit it using gradient maps, and add our name in text.


In Canva, which is a tool we sometimes encourage students to use, let's start to think about our assignment prompts. (We know it is early to start think about this, but it's just getting us toward the final proejct!) Design a multimedia assignment prompt that explains to students why they should do the alternative assignment your course requires: What will they learn as a result of doing this assignment? What skills and insights will they gain? A tool like Canva is a great way to integrate multimedia into your assignment prompts and other course materials.
