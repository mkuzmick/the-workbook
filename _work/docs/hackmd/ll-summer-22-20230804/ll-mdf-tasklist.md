Reframe email below to say: We're looking forward to seeing ____ at MDF orientation. Just so you know, we're going to work with  on producing a document about their projects for [department]. we'll check in with you (mention timeline in the doc) but if you'd like to meet in the meantime, we're always delighted to meet with you.

Hi all,

We hope everyone is doing well! Weâ€™re checking in about meeting over zoom for 30 minutes or so, ideally before the fall semester starts, to discuss a plan for the year that aligns with departmental priorities and ____ skills and interests. We are happy to find a time that works for everyone who'd like to be involved. (But otherwise we'll be glad to share over email a doc with you for feedback and/or approval - whatever mode works best for all of you, etc.)

Thanks so much!

All best,
Dani
