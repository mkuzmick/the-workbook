to prep, staff, order food, document
* NAHSP Final Project worktime - Tuesday 1:30pm in LL Studio
    * from email:
        * The students will be coming in with a plan for their final project video.  It would be great if there were a couple of folks they could ask for ideas or suggestions for making their visions come to life.  They will also have studio time in the Cabot Library media space later in the week, and the staff there will help them with post-production.  Some of the students might want to complete their whole project in the Learning Lab, and some might want to combine it with other footage from Cabot.
        * The theme of their final project is to address the following two prompts:
            * What is something I have learned during the program that excites me and that I would like to share with others?
            * How can I be an agent of positive change in my community?
        * Some of the ideas the students are tossing around now are filming a short public health announcement that could play on local stations, expanding their science explainer video into something that can be shared with middle school students on the Reservations, and making a video to share on social media to spread awareness of some of the substance abuse issues in the communities.
