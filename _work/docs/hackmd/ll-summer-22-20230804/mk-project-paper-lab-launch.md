why-paper?

Paper has been hidden in plain sight.

Well, we’ve always used it, to be sure.

And the move from 11x17 to cards to circles has been documented and thought about.

And there’s real value to uniformity and constraint, so it’s definitely not a bad thing that certain shapes have become standard forms/genres (2" x 3.5", 11" x 17", 3.5" buttons, 2.25" buttons, 1.5" buttons, 1" buttons )

But we haven’t been expanding its possibilities as aggressively as we might have.

The key thing is this: paper has been the dominant medium for the production and transmission of ideas for, like, ever. And this is for good reasons. It’s good at this.

And while we are typically finding ourselves pushing back against paper-centric activities, the paper itself isn’t really the problem with them (obviously).

And here we’ll want to NOT negate standard uses of paper in the name of aggressively “artistic” uses. We’re going to want to hybridize. Stay as close as we can to the MOST conventional uses of paper to convey ideas, but elevate and transform them with techniques drawn from the vast array of creative and industrial moves that are made with paper.
