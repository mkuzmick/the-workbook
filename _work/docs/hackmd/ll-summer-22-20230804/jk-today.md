### notes

So, today is my last day in the studio for a while. I'll be transitioning to to remote, writing and computer-based work I've been saving up for this summertime remote days that have built up over the year. I cleaned up the office space a bit, and designed a paper storage system to help keep things organized while I'm away. I hope folks find it useful and enjoyable as a system! I also "wiped" my office, aka the whiteboard and surfaces are ready for my return and the spatial planning/visualization prep for Fall!

I also set up this set of HackMds so that I can hit the ground running on my first remote day next week.
