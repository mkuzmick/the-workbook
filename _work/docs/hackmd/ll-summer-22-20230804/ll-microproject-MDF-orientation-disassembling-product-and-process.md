Thursday 18th: 9:00 - 10:30

## CHUNKS/MAP
do some opening framing about "alternative to...?" - could recap a bit from day 1 (we looked at what academic writing is doing in order to think about what we want to hold onto and where it falls short or doesn't meet our learning objectives. any alt assigment presumably would be crafted to meet those objectives and any other objectives the discipline has identified as important right now.)


ADD WEB-BASED ESSAY/INFOGRAPHIC THING AS A MODEL - A SAMPLE OF A COOL THING THAT WE THEN PUT INTO A CANVA/LOOKBOOK (9:20 - 9:40)

**9 - 9:20: activity (CD/JK/MK)**
Let's consider what multimodal forms like podcasts can do (and that academic writing can't do). Let's take apart the machine and think about what the "machine" of the podcast enables for learners.

To do this, we can consider:
* How a podcast conveys data to the listener
* What the different components of the podcast are
* How its structure differs from the conventional moves of academic writing

Listening to an excerpt from the beginning of the podcast Serial, let's try to isolate the different components, reflecting on the functional role they play. 

Let's do the same with a video essay.

this could be where they post to slack - save-your-links, e.g.

**9:20 - 9:40 activity 2: finding models on your own and learn some more systems stuff as you go off and find the thing (slack, hackmd)**

**ADD IN SUB-ACTIVITY RE: SLACK, HACKMD, ETC.**
* post our two things(serial and vox) that we unpack in activity 1

Now you go out on the internet and post that:
In pairs, poke around on the internet together, linking below examples of forms or communication and making that inspire you. These can certainly be examples of academic work, but they needn't be. 

As you share with each other, try to come up with some language for articulating what the work is doing and why you think there's something intriguing there for students. 
* Does it offer a new way of communicating the ideas of your discipline? 
* Does it help provide a more authentic means of assessment? 
* Is it interesting in ways that are hard to define?

Please share links to anything digital here, but also write the names of the interesting forms you discover on cards! 

**9:40 - 10: activity 3: share in pairs and come up with a presentation** (CD)
* discuss w/cards: what do you want to insert instead of text in a "positive" way (5 mins)
* collective hackmd where they're embedding
* slacking their examples

**10 - 10:20: present - CHANGE THIS TO A CANVA/LOOKBOOK ACTIVITY WHERE THEY PUT IN THEIR MODELS AND USING IT AS A KIND OF PINTEREST BOARD?**
could be fun to do presenting on stage w/green screen here!


* give us your close-readings of this cool stuff and unpack its moves

**10: 20 - 10:30: break**

## ideas
* serial (or other podcast) and vox video activity to unpack the forms (podcasts, video essays)
    * what are the parts of this machine?
    * and how does it work?
* have mdfs find more examples on their own or in small groups? 
* have mdfs analyze in small groups some examples we give to them?
    * could also have mdfs think about the rationales for these forms based on what they can achieve or do
* unpack the process of making, say, a video essay by breaking down the components
    * listing all of the media assets, VO, structure, etc. on cards
    * think about what students would learn by doing these different steps (leads into part 2)


* if we want to do something in the infographic zone: [our workshop plan for Shai's class](https://hackmd.io/o0oUTOTYQSaK3DldU0_Sww)

## goals and other ideas

* map of the way sources function in writing
    * data, etc. 
* articulate your own interpretation in multimedia
* what do you want to insert instead of text in a "positive" way 
* gallery of cool stuff 
* close-readings of this cool stuff and unpack its moves
* tastes of some processes for making this cool stuff
* reflecting on that process
