# mdf-training

## LL bok seminar debriefing
20220616 - MK, CD, DD @ LL Studio (MK + CD working on whiteboard, DD taking notes)

### bok-seminar flow
#### week 1, day 1
learning objectives: backward design, Bloom's taxonomy etc., conventional T&L topics
framing: attentive to what? how? from text to ...?
#### week 1, day 2 - pinterest based thinking
learning objectives: unpacking audio visual examples and models, with an accent on speakign with images. used micas and cameras. 
framing: process + product. so do a close reading of something, but when a finished form is connected to somethig in your discipline. then think about the process of achieving that thing.
#### week 1, day 3 - more rebuilding
learning objectives: infographics, graphic design, visual explanations. producing documents. (students might use Canva but we'd want MDFs to do this in more advanced ways)
framing: computers as tool for scaffolding
#### week 2, day 4 - 
learning objectives: games, (and for MDFs, theatre)
framing: live interactions and experiences 
#### week 2, day 5 - 
grading, responding, celebrating (this could move up, potentially with day 3 on scaffolding)
#### other things
* databases and collections
* rationales and practice of orally explaining things (done pretty much every day)

### debrief discussion
* shifting from a reading centric literacy to making centric literacy
* what does the future of academic communication look like? (we could structure the mdf orientation to get us there)
    * possibly we look at samples of academic writing they like and ask what are the moves that matter in your discipline
* motivations/desires - ways to map out/thinking about planning
    * want the best for your students
    * cool and fun stuff (people just like podcasts, or like infographics)
    * academic research and dissemination, career goals/job search
    * politico-ethical, intervening in the world
* map of types of things that they/we might be making
    * interactions
        * ex) mic tasting
    * events
    * media-based arguments
        * ex) lookbooks
    * systems/collections
* will need to decide what goes into orientation that has to be in August, and what can wait until semester meetings
 
## planning
### goals
* MDFs should produce a menu/lookbook/pitch
    * we need to provide examples of what we've done in the past, showing LL examples of prompts and materials
    * MDFs don't need to generate all of the content of the lookbook themselves
* rationale (MDfs getting comfortable orally explaining things)
### activities
* to the camera
    * intro and goals
    * 60 second explanation of MDF role
    * 60 second rationale for a form/median
    * 60 second identification of a discipline-specific move and it's real world analogues/multimedia analogues
    * 60 second rational for the ethical-political reasons for intervening in an alternative form
* performance practice (and tips)
* close reading of a game
    * reading on Shell (tetrad?, venues?)
* share a model and unpack
* discuss readings
### mechanic 
* collab on hackMD 
### systems
* get folks on slack, gdrive, hackMD, gcal, shared accounts (like studio@learninglab or fellows@learninglab etc.)
* having it set up so they really see the value on it
    * have cool visual feedback on an mdf-reporting calendar or something that immediately becomes part of a timeline or airtable



## to do's
* organize all of this
* start trying to pull together all the readings and that we have them as PDFs
* aggregate all the links here for readings that were used in LL bok seminar, and save PDFs to an mdf-shared-resources folder that can ultimtely go in an MDF shared google drive they create
