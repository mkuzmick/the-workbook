# Understanding Audio Recording

The theory behind digital audio is deep. Here is an overview of information that will help you get the most out of your audio recordings.
##
## Mics

The Learning Lab is equipped with quality microphones for recording, which should already be set up for your use. 

The first thing you will want to do is follow the microphone cable from the audio interface to the corresponding mic to make sure you are recording into the correct microphone. 

Next, get settled into a comfortable position with proper posture. This is meant to reduce chair movement, fidgeting, and repositioning while recording as well as provide a foundation for clear vocals.

When recording it is recommended to be about four fingers away from the mic. This may feel uncomfortably close at first, but this is the optimal range for picking up desired sounds. There is some leeway here depending on the natural volume of the person being recorded

A helpful tip for podcasting is to angle your speech just slightly to one side so that the mic avoids the full impact of your consonants like “p” and “t”. When recording with two people it can be helpful to direct your speech slightly towards your partner to both avoid sending consonants directly towards the mic as well as create an engaging environment for conversation.

## Levels

Once you are ready to record you will want to check your levels. To do so, use your natural speaking voice and adjust the mic input level on the audio interface. You'll want to reach about 2/3 of the maximum on the input meter. Around -12dB - -8dB, into the yellow is fine but stay away from the red - an indication that your audio is clipping. By leaving this headroom you are left with clear audio, suited for further processing and effects.

## Recording 

To begin recording make sure the desired track is set to the correct input and armed to record.

When recording a podcast it is good practice to wait a few moments between hitting record and speaking, this way there is a section of the recording that has only captured the room noise. Having a section of only room noise allows you to remove the noise using noise reduction plug-ins.

Once the recording has started there is no need to be nervous or a perfectionist about what is being recorded. Continue recording until you are done rather than stopping to correct any mistakes that may have been made. This will save a lot of time in the long run since any mistakes can be edited out afterwards.
