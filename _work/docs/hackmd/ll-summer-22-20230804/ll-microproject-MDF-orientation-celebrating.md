# ll-microproject-MDF-orientation-celebrating

## TIMELINE
Thursday 25th: 10:30 - 12:00

## ideas

* lookbook-as-gallery activity
    * think of this as a celebration of the different types of multimodal assignments, activities, and forms you've developed and explored during these two weeks
    * create a two-page spread (or scrolling canva site?) that functions as a lookbook with image and text that provides some rationales, explanations, etc. of what is possible when working in these forms
    * something that, like student work, you want your department to be able to hold on to and refer to in the future as they think about multimodal assignments/communications
    * could even start small - on pinterest and then move onto canva by the end of the session
    * or give them indesign template? (or resource doc with linda courses on layout we used last year during essentialsLab)

* design a gallery in the space
    * different teams have different zones
    * like a reality tv interior design show - teams of designers get to transform their corner of the studio into a space that can celebrate student worK (and in this case, work that mdfs have done!)
    * if we do this, could also have a little confessional booth camera/mic/lights set up where they can talk about what it was like to work on their team of designers and we can capture footage of them in teams to make a little reality tv show like the vogue exercise??
