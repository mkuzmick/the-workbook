## week 1 (June 6-10)

This week I was in the studio for one last day before taking off on vacation. I had to be around to kick off our first official week of summer. Since it was my last day in the studio for a while, I cleaned up the office space a bit, and designed a paper storage system to help keep things organized while I'm away. I hope folks find it useful and enjoyable as a system! I also "wiped" my office, so that the whiteboard and surface areas are ready for my return and the impending spatial planning and visualization prep for Fall!

Over the next few weeks I'll be transitioning to some writing and computer-based work I've been saving up for these summertime remote days that have built up over the year. To help myself prepare for that I also loaded up a drive with some media assets and set up a collection of HackMds so that I can hit the ground running on my first remote day next week.

## week 2 (June 13-16)

This week was my first try at summer remote work. I only worked one day, but feel like I actually got a lot accomplished in the writing & reporting zone. So much so, that I kind of wanted to keep working on it... but made myself stop to have a reasonable sense of how much I can do in a day!

I'm still working mostly in the LLUF HackMD workspace, until I get things organized past the drafting stage. But here are some screenshots of a just a few of the docs I was working on.

[The LLUF Index](/TQTCZjYpR4ykY-8gQp6c9Q) is a working doc, a list of links, and a little note on the stage of each LLUF's report doc. 

| "created" | "collected" | "drafted" |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| basic doc created and formatted (will work on ways to automate this for next year!)     | materials collected from slack, airtable, and hackMD     | ready for another set of eyes to take a pass     |

This is bascially where all the LLUF reports start. I have a set of tags, that hopefully will be useful down the road, followed by an H1 that is theie name (there is an internal debate ocurring within my mind between 3 versions of the name. 1. FirstName only, 2. FirstName-LastInitial as above, and 3. Full Name). I then make a table to put links to their main labs, a section for a list of Tools they worked in, and a section for their main Projects/Work. At the bottom, I include a section for notes, links, and miscellaneous materials to collect that will be helpful for drafting.

I used this script built during the codeLab essentials module to find media of work to add to the docs that are in the "collected" stage. I also check through the LLUF HackMD space and their individual channels if the works seem suspiciously sparse.

Here is an example screenshot of a portion of one of the "drafted" report docs. One thing I'm thinking about is possibly changing the "Projects" heading to "Works", so I'd love some feedback on that idea if anyone has thoughts! I guess I'm wondering if we want to keep it Projects so it matches the MDF reports, and to keep with our "projects-are-the-thing" framework...or if it helps tell the MDF story better if their Projects are not lumped together with the smaller, more modular project support and shift-to-week sized work that LLUFs typically do.

## week 3 (June 21-24)
![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03M17R3SLV/image.png?pub_secret=48c4450f27)

This week I mainly continued to write up LLUF reports using the process from last week. I am finding this process really valuable, especially for those LLUFs who are returning next year. It will be nice to use as a foundation for where to pick up their progress and to go over with them. I'm keen to find ways of doing this more regularly throughout the year, and for the fellows to be more involved in it.

One thing I'm curious about is how to create reports that will be mulit-functional. As stated above, there is clear value in them as a form of formative assesment for returning LLUFs, but they are also meant to be useful for various reports-so I'm interested to test out a couple of ideas using airtable as well as some react or next.js components or templates that would help us produce automated variations-taking content from these longer form markdown docs and turning them into postcards, buttons, single project blogs, etc. I know this is somethng several folks are thinking about and working towards across the LL and even Bok, so I'm eager to push this goal forward in the coming weeks and months!

## week 4 (June 27-30)


## week 5 (July 5-8) & 6 (July 11-15)
vacation!

## week 7

Back in person at 50 Church this week! Started off with a quick stand up meeting to plan out the last 4 weeks of summer! 

We listed out the big projects to work on, and then chose a micro-project for the day: building out a gaming set up as a prototype for ENG189VG. Christine, Luke and I worked together to get the Threadripper PC, a mac, speakers, lights, camera, and amx mini extreme all set up to capture game play. We chose the small fellows room so we could also try out a potential set up for it as an editing suite. We acquired the course "reading list" (aka the games utilized in the course) from Steam, and in the process we created a Learning Lab Studio Steam account. By troubleshooting and setting up a potential set up for this course, we are working towards a few deliverables listed out in our morning meeting: 
1. a front-end deliverable of a multi media essay on moves and mechanics in video games
2. back-end deliverables of the system and materials that make said essay possible.

* followed the next.js tutorial to quickly build a simple site
* added mdx to my next site with [this](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) and [actually this](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/)
    * If youâ€™re using webpack (or Create React App (CRA), Next.js, or Vue CLI, which use it), install and configure @mdx-js/loader
    * now trying this [guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-next-js-mdx-blog/#creating-configuring-next-js-app)
