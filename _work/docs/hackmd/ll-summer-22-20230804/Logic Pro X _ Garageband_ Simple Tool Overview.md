# Logic Pro X / Garageband: Simple Tool Overview

Logic Pro X and Garageband have several tools available to edit audio and midi regions. The available editing tools differ based on the type of region or track selected.

**Pointer Tool**

This is the default tool.
- Select an item by clicking or multiple items by holding Shift.
- Move items by clicking and dragging to desired location.
- Duplicate items by holding Option and moving the copy to desired location.
- Adjust length of an item by grabbing a bottom corner and dragging.
- Loop regions by dragging the top-right corner of the region.


**Pencil Tool**

- Add events directly into logic using the Pencil tool. For example, drawing in regions to plan out the arrangement of a song before adding musical material.

**Eraser Tool**

- Delete events using the Eraser tool. The Eraser will delete all selected content, as if you pressed the delete button.

**Scissors Tool**

- Used to split regions and events. This is helpful if you wish to edit only a selection of a longer region. For example, you can cut out a section of audio with a voice that is too quiet and boost the volume of only that portion.
- Moving the playhead to the desired time of the split and pressing **[⌘T]** has the same effect. 



**Glue Tool**

- Used to join adjacent regions and events. This is helpful to visually tidy up regions that you may have previously split.
- Selecting desired adjacent regions and pressing **[⌘J]** has the same effect.

**Fade Tool**

- Used to create fades on audio regions.
- Fades can remove unwanted pops and clicks at the beginning and end of audio regions.
- By dragging from the meeting point of two adjacent audio files, an equal crossfade can be made.
