# mk-project-print-airtable-from-slack

Let's add this to the mk-summer-bot or ll-studio-bot as an alternative to the airtable block.

## plan

A simple airtable2pdf tool that we launch from within Slack. Could also grab and format some Slack content too.

### basic workflow

- slash command or similar in Slack (or scheduled event)
- query Airtable to pull down all tasks
- format in React app? or with ejs on Express?
- use Puppeteer to print, maybe using [this tutorial for it?](https://blog.theodo.com/2021/10/pdf-generation-react-puppeteer/)
- send this pdf back to Slack
- MAYBE automate printing, but that seems a little bit much

### things to print




### moonshot requests

- also grab data from Slack and format it into PDFs
- tie this in to Video Production Workflow
- tie this in to button-making
- tie this in to album-making
- tableaux vivantes
