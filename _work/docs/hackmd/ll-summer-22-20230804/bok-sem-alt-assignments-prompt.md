Design Your Alternative Assignment
The Prompt for the Final Project


If you choose to submit the Final Project (for Bok Seminar credit), here are the basic requirements and details on submission.

The Requirements

Please submit both a Prompt and a Rationale. These can be in the same document (a Google doc or Word doc or Pages doc or Markdown doc, etc etc), or they can be separate if you would like to preserve the design choices you've made for either. For instance, you may choose to create a student-facing prompt in Canva that includes embedded photos and videos as examples of what you'd like the students to do, in which case you can submit two separate links (one for the Prompt, and one for the Rationale). The Prompt can be as long or as short as you'd like it to be (we will assume you're making this decision intentionally based on what you think will help the students), but should probably be at least the equivalent of a single-spaced page (in the 200+ word range). And the Rationale can be a page or two (300-500 words)â€”or longer if you find yourself inspired!

Please submit your links by email to Christine (cdauria@g.harvard.edu) and Marlon (mkuzmick@g.harvard.edu) by June 30th.

Tips for the Prompt

Here are some things to consider in the Prompt:
describe what you'd like the students to do
include any technical requirements and instructions (how long should it be? when should it be turned in? what format(s) are acceptable?)
provide some tips on how to perform the task well (this could come in the form of a formal rubric, but it could also involve a list of key elements that a successful project will include)
if there are multiple parts of the assignment or multiple steps involved in performing it, try to break these down for students

Tips for the Rationale

Here are some things to consider in the Rationale:
articulate the ways in which the final product students turn in will reveal that they have grasped the key learning objectives of your class
articulate the ways in which the steps involved in the process are in alignment with your learning objectives
articulate the ways in which the mode or medium of communication the students will be performing is in alignment with the ideas and skills that matter in your discipline
explain some of the design choices you've made, particularly any that you put a lot of thought into and are proud of!
