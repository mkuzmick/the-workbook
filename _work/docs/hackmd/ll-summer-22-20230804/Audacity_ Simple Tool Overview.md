**Selection Tool**

This is the default tool.
- Select a region of audio by clicking the beginning of the desired section and dragging until the other edge of your selection.
- select the entirety of a track by double clicking its waveform.
- select content from multiple tracks at once by extending your drag up or down onto the next track.
- Move items by clicking and dragging the top of the desired audio section to a new location.


**Envelope Tool**

- Create and manipulate control points that determine volume changes over time.
- Dragging the top or bottom points will keep you within the original volume envelope, avoiding distortion.
- Dragging an inner point allows you to amplify beyond the original volume envelope of the track.
- Useful for correcting undesired fluctuations in volume, for example, you moved away from or closer to the mic while recording a podcast.

**Draw Tool**

- Used to eliminate narrow clicks and pops in audio by smoothing out the contour of the samples

**Multi-Tool**

- Automatically selects a tool according to where the pointer is located on the waveform. The pointer changes to show which of its functions is currently available.
