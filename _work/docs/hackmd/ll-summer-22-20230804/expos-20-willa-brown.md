Expository Writing 20 2022 Fall / Full Term / Section: 207 / Class number: 15402
Remembering the Civil War
Monday 12:00 PM - 01:15 PM; Wednesday 12:00 PM - 01:15 PM

## cd notes:
course topics: public history, how we learn history, who is included, who is not

research paper and capstone: give tour as a class

videos of their tour stop
do more on mapping
instead of tour stops, map points; interactive map

mk: words that are tied to location; geotags that allow people to experience things as they walk in a particular location (like podcasts geo-tagged to a monument)
collective body of multimedia that is geo-tagged

what is the media they're creating?
if just text then podcast might be way to go
not getting anything from visual channel/in video
but if commenting on images, annotating maps - might need a video project for this

3-5 minute audio with an image that goes with it like shownotes would with a podcast? 
main visual could be the location - on website with key images and a map that represents that location

students dont need to build architecture for the web container 
storymaps or simple wordpress or canvas page populated with 2-3 photos taken on location

accessibility: if they're telling this story through multiple media, it's more accessible for people who can't necessarily access (via sight) what they're talking about
what ways of presenting information are disabling for some people?

Willa has taught this in the past:
[national parks manual](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/http://npshistory.com/publications/interpretation/imr-theme-guide.pdf)

Access to argument and public stance

students choose Boston-based sites, thinking about it as a group project from the beginning so they think of a theme that makes sense for the map

thinking beyond the Freedom Trail - revolutionary history


### support structure:
* 30 second podcast
    * technically whats involved
    * storytelling success tips
    * hands on experience of doing it (going into the Yard to document a place; draw places on Harvard's campus from a hat)
    * make a mini-map, gesture to it using the green screen
* additional office hours or space if they need it
    * or use the tips we give them about recording in their space (we can offer these on day 1)
* editing of it
    * could do a session on this later in the semester, optional afternoon thing that they'll come by? 
    * or workshop on GarageBand 
    * hackathon
* final event?

On Boston's Own History, on public history, who is included, how it's told. Last semester they did close reading of freedom trail materials. Read theory on memory and historical memory and then analyzed a training manual for tour guides. Then they give their own tour. It was just too cold to do an outdoor capstone in Boston. Wants to do more on mapping. Instead of tour stops, would do ma points. will collectively create an interactive map that would show you text and images. 

MK: you want words that are tied to locations. You don't have to decide once and for all--could record podcasts that are geotagged. Create a collective body of media that is geotagged. get them to produce media that has long and lat connected to it.

W: loves the idea of it being something that could be experienced in these different ways. Now, HOW do we do this logistically and technologically? What framing for the students?

MK: what piece of media are the students creating? Just text? Then podcast is way to go. If images or map annotation included, might be a video.

W: Podcast show notes...? Audio comes up when map is clicked, but images could be incorporated as show notes

MK: a podcast listened to on location, also website that has images of location to go along with the audio. Storymaps, or wordpress. Also think about this as an issue of accessibility story is told through multiple media.

W: narratives as arguments. read national parks training manual on site interpretation. translated to the elements of the academic essay. 

W: There will be a theme for the map. doesn't have to just be the freedom trail. Hard to get the whole class around a theme, they all want to do their own theme. Would love it to have a theme that they decide on, broad enough for them to each find something interesting to them. 

MK: mechanics for this. "the alternative to.." whatever typical tour there is...or a counter typical Harvard tour. The freedom trail never stops...what comes after the freedom trail? what if you extend it further into the future or further geographically?

W: BEYOND THE FREEDOM TRAIL (that could be the course title!!)

MK: it really wants to be an ar experience, like 3-4 years out.


LOGISITICS PITCH:
1. a small taste workshop. first thing is to do a 30 second podcast about a very local site. storytelling and technological skills: how do you succeed? activity: get a card that gives them a location, run to the yard and get john harvard statue, and the science center. a prototyping experience to give them a taste of the process
2. offer additional office hours and space if they need it, but honestly they can use our tips, tricks
3. the editing of it, can provide online resources with an optional drop by time or workshop on a tool. hackathon-evening, get pizza and have MPAs/LLUFs around to help students knock the thing out when it is close to due.
4. final event to present their work to community partners, etc.

intro workshop activity: 6-7 locations with a live podcast in our studio, we can put that together into an object that they can see and get excited about. make a minature map of harvard yard or whever we send them so they can gesture towards taht as they do our studio presentation.

W will look into community partners-Leventhal (sp?) or local historical societies.
