# LL Summer Projects, Labs Planning

## prep for fall

### labs and studios

[list of all the labs](https://hackmd.io/K2_yOaeEQbG38m3GUmf_gg) and much more.

By August 12, let's have the "superset" listed and defined, as a sort of menu we can provide MDFs during orientation. This can include 
- labs we've had in the past
- specific working zones or equipment we have that could form the foundation of a lab or studio
- moonshot-like projects that could form the foundation for a lab

Participants can decide whether it's a lab or a studio.

Let's come up with some mechanics for choosing those labs from an array of options.
