Hi all,

We're so excited to see you at orientation, which starts officially on Tuesday, August 16 at 9 am in the Learning Lab studio! Please continue reading more for more information the orientation and then make sure to fill out this [MDF Orientation RSVP form](https://airtable.com/shrifZxXjGRfKFaVD) at your earliest convenience.

In addition to the required meetings, we're going to be setting up additional times or meetings to help you learn all of the skills required to support your projects you'll be working on this term. We plan on starting this alongside the mandatory meetings and have added a couple of questions on the RSVP form to get a sense of what you might like to learn first.

All of the sessions will take place in-person at the Learning Lab, located in the Bok Center's 50 Church Street office ([directions can be found on our website](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/contact-us)). Here are a few things to note about them:
* Required sessions: 9am-1pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Lunch provided.
* Optional sessions:
    * Monday, August 15, 1-4pm: we'll be available if you'd like to drop in to the Learning Lab and check-in with us
    * Tuesday, August 23 1:30-2:30pm Digital Accessibility Session (**strongly encouraged**)
    * Additional optional sessions will be scheduled 1:30-2:30pm and 2:45-3:45pm during both weeks. These sessions will focus on the tools and workflows that support multimodal academic communication. **Please make sure to indicate on  the form the tools you are interested in and on what dates you might be able to attend optional sessions - this will help us finalize our schedule.**
    * Friday, August 19 and Friday, August 26, 4 pm: Happy Hour!

Please make sure to fill out this [MDF Orientation RSVP form](https://airtable.com/shrifZxXjGRfKFaVD). As always, please reach out to us at learninglab@fas.harvard.edu with any questions or concerns you have.

lookbooks could be in hackMD and Canva (JK is excited about Canva) so training on graphic design principles but minimal training would be needed to use Canva
presumably on days 2 and 3 they come up with 3-ish ideas for their lookbook and then final day they finish the lookbook (as part of celebrating/etc. student work themed day). and designLab could be friday lunch-time ish if they wanted to get prototypes made of one of their assignments.

graphic design principles during the live day (a couple of examples? getting them to do the pinterest-y thing of finding examples that tell us what they're kind of looking for/thinking about etc.)
