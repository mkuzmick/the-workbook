# notes on academic writing samples

Petrodocumentary and the remaking of new deal culture
Molly Geidel
American Quarterly
* pp. 804-805: description of the film and some analysis of its form
    * i'd want some clips of the film here, so students get a sense of the form of the thing being analyzed
    * voiceover really key here - so this could be a good place for audio clips too
    * and i could imagine an activity that has students experimenting with voiceover and footage - thinking about the relationship between these two things, how the use of the voice has affective and political effects
    * what's really useful is the analysis itself - close-reading of a source valuable skill (would meet one of my learning objectives - students should have the ability to critically analyze sources and come to an understanding of them that's grounded in evidence from those sources)
* something I want to keep from a lot of humanities methods: being able to see and understand the social/etc. forces that shape cultural forms


Striking News, Isaac et al
from American Journal of Sociology
* discussion section (pp. 1639-1641): would want this to address the learning objective of political commitment/making a claim that has larger political stakes
    * given that we have this great analysis of the coverage of strikes, what do we want students to think about coverage of strikes?
    * do we want them to be positioned to critique the media sources they engage with? if so, can we design assignments that get them to perform the moves that are required to do this?
    * do we want to model politically engaged scholarship for our students, making it plain when we find a certain phenomenon unacceptable or politically opposed to our own values and commitments?
    * if discussion section is a place to explain what's gained through this study, it could be cool to extend this beyond the warrant of furthering knowledge in a particular field (that's what i'm trying to get at above)
* maybe develop an assignment that asks students to recreate media coverage of some kind - moving away from the archive and into the world of the media that they know and use (especially since access to archives is limited in a lot of cases to faculty and graduate students, people institutionally recognized as developing expertise in a field and therefore who have the 'rights' to collections)
* throughout the article, really want to see images of this coverage - the images that accompany articles, the headlines and how the graphic design of the page produces the political/ideological effect under examination

Carolyn Abbate
* the first page structure of intro hook, and ten the Abstract as a sort of footnote.
