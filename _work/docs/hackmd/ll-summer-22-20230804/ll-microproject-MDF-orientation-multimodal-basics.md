## CHUNKS/MAP

**ADD IN SOME OTHER HANDOUTS HERE - EXPOS DESIGNING AN ESSAY ASSIGNMENT, ELEMENTS OF THE ESSAY** 

framing for the academic writing activity: BEFORE WE THROW WRITING ASIDE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT WORKS WELL, WHAT ISN'T WORKING

trajectory:
letâ€™s look at experts in your field and how they present their ideas, because this is expertise demonstrated
should we be assigning students the job of aiming for that kind of communication OR should we get students to do something else
AND should we maybe think about scholars doing something else

**10: 20 - 10:50 activity 1:** (CD)
integrate riffing here (using overhead and/or in small studio)

on cards list:
- all the other goals you may have, as a teacher, as a scholar, as a citizen, as a representative of your discipline. Really feel free to think big here. Do you want to create a more equitable University? more educated citizens? Do you want to stop climate change? (maybe limit yourself to goals you think Higher Ed can actually tackle!)

List as many of these as you can as individuals in 5 minutes, then share with a partner. As you share, definitely feel free to add more goals of your own if their cards are giving you ideas.


**11 - 11:20: what are the moves that matter in your discipline** (CD)

What currently happens in your discipline? To what extent is that demonstrating the things that matter to you as an instructor, scholar, or reflective of how students learn? Where when we might want to go beyond text? Which moves happen there that you want to hold on to and do better in some other form? Which moves don't hold anymore?

**FIND SAMPLES FOR THIS AND MAKE INTO ACTIVITY WHERE WE MODEL CLOSE-READING FOR THEM - SAMPLE PAPERS good example: the music essay when we can't hear the music**
[Abbatte article](https://online-ucpress-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/jams/article/69/3/793/91988/Sound-Object-Lessons)

* give an example and talk through as pairs (10 minutes)
* go on JSTOR or Harvard Libraries site and find a major text in your field
* unpack the moves this text makes and explain why it's important in your field
* note moments when something beyond text is needed or could push this analysis to the next level or could help us understand the data in a new/better way
* post these to our systems - **ADD IN ANOTHER SUB-ACTIVITY HERE RE: THE SYSTEMS**
    * printing and buttons
    * highlighting/annotating with buttons

**11:20 - 11:40: read a chunk and talk through it**
* close readings of at least three paragraphs
* and linked to a learning objective defined earlier in the day


**11:40 - 12: share out in the small studio? or using photobooth mechanic?**
* make a 30-60 second micro-pitch-sized point about it, with an example of some sort
* goal is that they walk away with way of articulating what academic writing in their discipline is doing right or not right and that they're position as an mdf will try to in some way solve
* what is to be done: act 1
    * is it that the way academics are communicating in a discpline are wrong?
    * is it that what we're asking students to do to display their growing expertise wrong?
    * what are some of the key problems that they can ground in a key learning objective?
    * bonus points for integrating more than 1 of the cards 
    * tension/resolution - but the PEAK OF TENSION is what we're after here
* what they want to learn here is justification of the lookbook/menu - through ability to justify via learning objectives

EVERYTHING IS BROKEN, TELL US WHY
DAY 2: FORM OR PROCESS THAT OFFERS HOPE

WEEK 2: REALLY PRACTICALLY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO!







## IDEAS

- discussion of key terms/overview:
    - backward design
    - alignment
    - formative and summative assessment
    - scaffolding
- show some models of "future of academic communications"
    - horizons
    - [past mdf projects](https://hackmd.io/R9Gpr4LFQuaQdPqyNO4j7g)
- analyze a paragraph from an article in your field; what are the 'moves that matter' in your discipline, make a list of these and put on the white board
- riff on the "future of academic communication" to camera
    - in your intellectual utopia, what are the forms, media that people use to communicate? why? and to what end(s)?
- find an example from a journal or academic text in your field; where is something beyond text needed
    - annotate using buttons and white board or overhead camera while speaking to camera
    - what can media do that text alone cannot? (or: could you envision using media to augment textual analyses/content? if so, how?)
- find some models of alternative modes of communication and unpack them for us in a gallery tour (maybe link to printing and/or green screen)
    - could do this in small groups - go find some examples from outside of the univerity that inspire you formally, aesthetically, etc.
    - what are the rationales you would use to convince students and/or faculty that using some of these forms to communicate academic ideas is worthwhile? make a list of 3-5 potential justifications using cards and presenting under overhead
- design a potential multimodal assignment and pitch to camera in the small studio
    - keep in mind 2-3 rationales you'd use to explain the purpose of this assignment to students
    - what learning objectives would this assignment address?


### goals
* in instructional design, you have objectives and something that achieves those objectives
* what is multimodal comms and why would academics do it
* when you think of learning objectives in your discipline, how would those map on to things you'd see in multimodal comms

understanding what learning design is

what are your goals
how would you achieve them

let's look at moves in academic writing and figure out what's going on and where it might make sense to go beyond text alone to achieve what the writer wants to achieve
