# Logic / Garageband: Audio Equalization

An equalizer, or EQ, sculpts incoming audio by cutting and boosting specific frequency bands. EQ can be used for correcting problem frequencies, as well as for more artistic purposes like creating distinct sonic coloration (e,g. simulating the sound of a megaphone, an old-fashioned telephone, or muffled sound coming from a distant room).

Logic Pro X and Garageband have various EQs available for use:

- **[Channel EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/channel-eq-use-tips-lgcef1edc27f/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - 8-band equalizer featuring an analyzer showing real time changes on the frequency spectrum. Used to shape sounds
- **[Linear Phase EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/linear-phase-eq-use-tips-lgcef1edc8da/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - Similar to Channel EQ but preserves the phase of the audio signal and creates additional latency
- **[Match EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/use-match-eq-lgcef1edc5c5/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - A learning EQ that analyzes the frequency spectrum of an audio signal to then be stored as a template and used on other audio
- **[Single Band EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/single-band-eq-controls-lgcef1edd13d/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - Used for simple EQ work
- **[Vintage Console EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/vintage-console-eq-controls-lgcp2d56e64b/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - Emulates the EQ section of a Neve 1073 console, noted for its tonal color, warmth, smooth top end, and mid-forward presence
- **[Vintage Graphic EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/vintage-graphic-eq-controls-lgcp75436181/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - Emulates the Proportional Q design of the API 560 console, widening filter bandwidth at lower cut/boost levels and narrowing at higher levels
- **[Vintage Tube EQ](https://support.apple.com/guide/logicpro/vintage-tube-eq-controls-lgcp137f13da/10.7.3/mac/11.0)** - Emulates a combination of the Pultec EQP-1A and the MEQ-5 valve equalizers
