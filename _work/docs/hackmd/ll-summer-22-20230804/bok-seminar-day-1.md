# bok-seminar-day-1




At the end of class, we did a gallery tour around the studio, with each pairing describing the learning goals they had in mind for their courses and how those learning goals would be ideally met by the form they envisoned for their alternative assignment.

In defining their objectives, students identified a set of core goals, including:
- public-facing
- low barrier to entry for students, inclusive
    - forms that are democratic
- encouraging students to reflect, critique, debate
- develop familiarity with the academic terrain, key terms and concepts in the field
- encourage students to reflect on formal choices (including in unexpected zones; thinking beyond conventional data visualization moves in EPS, for ex.)
- students take an active role in their learning
- students undertake acts of teaching as well as learning (something between memorization and application)
- seeing ideas, concepts, etc. as historically, socially, politically situated
