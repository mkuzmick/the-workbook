# DaVinci Resolve File Management

Keeping your media together is the most important aspect of file management. You want to keep your video files, audio files, and graphics in places that are easy to find and navigate through.

The most efficient way to organize and manage files in DaVinci is to make **bins**. 

Bins are essentially just folders and there are many different ways to make them.

1) If you have your media already organized in a folder you can just import or **drag and drop that folder into the media pool in either the media tab, the cutting tab, or the editing tab.** DaVinci will automatically make that into a bin for you. 

2) You can also create a new bin by **right clicking the media pool and selecting "New Bin" in the drop down menu in either the media tab, the cutting tab, or the editing tab.**

3) The final way to create a new bin is to go to the file menu and select "New Bin".

The best way to organize your files using bins is making a bin for each of the following:
1) Video
2) Audio
3) Sequences/Timelines
4) Graphics

Do not worry about **smart bins**. Smart bins are for media that is used throughout multiple projects. A smart bin may be used for a series of commercials or a television show. So just ignore them for now if you are not doing any projects like those. 

To open a bin double click on that bin. To navigate back click on "Master" which will be nearby the media pool. This is the same for the media tab, cutting tab, and the editing tab.
