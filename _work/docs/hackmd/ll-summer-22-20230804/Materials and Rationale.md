[Medium Size Work Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/Ironclad-General-All-Purpose-Performance-Washable/dp/B00004XOH7/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3KKPJ6V54132R&keywords=work%2Bgloves&qid=1652725550&sprefix=work%2Bgloves%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-5&th=1)
We are currently using Casey's personal pair of leather gloves at the Button Studio. We have had 2 fellows in the last week get minor cuts from button supplies. It seems prudent to invest in a couple of pairs of Fellows' gloves so Casey can have his back and the fellows have the option of wearing gloves or bare-handledly buttoning at their own risk.

We are finding great use in printable icons as badges for the various tools and media, conceptual forms and theories, and overall visual facilitation and information dissemination. We have previously printed on sticker paper and found it to be a very engaging and popular medium, espeically among the fellows and students who come for course workshops & hackathons 

Akin to buttons and stickers, there seems to be potential for those visuals as temporary tattoos (or waterslide decals for objects) as well. Imagine the added layer of a an icon or symbol appearing on the back of a hand that is manipulating paper for visual facilitation at our overhead stations. Or even as a means for student engagementm as an entrance mechanic in our workshops, or as advertising for our programs. Like the way in which Ishmael encounters the "other" in Queequeg who is covered in tattoos, introducing temporary tattoos as a mechanic or medium could offer us a new way into another perspective or way of engaging in our academic grapplings.
