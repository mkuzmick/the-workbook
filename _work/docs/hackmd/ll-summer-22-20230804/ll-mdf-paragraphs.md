The Bok Center’s Media & Design Fellows (MDFs) support innovative course development within the FAS, partnering with faculty and staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials, and assignments for undergraduate courses and departments. 

Media & Design Fellows fall in one of two categories:Departmental/Program-based Media & Design Fellows are based in a department or program and develop tools and materials for that department’s courses; Bok Media & Design Fellows are based in the Bok Center’s Learning Lab and support a range of related departments and/or General Education courses. Depending on the project, MDFs create digital content, assignments, and resources, develop and support new teaching and learning practices and build course materials, including text, video, illustrations, animations, websites and ways for students to interact with these media. Additionally, MDFs may offer workshops and other forms of guidance to help students complete new course activities.

Media & Design Fellows also have the opportunity to engage with other instructional support units on campus. Fellows may receive mentorship from the Libraries, Museums, and Academic Technology among others, developing expertise in tools or media that are relevant for their disciplines. While previous experience with the relevant tools and technologies is useful for MDFs, applicable disciplinary background and a willingness to learn new media is all that is required in most cases. Bok staff and other mentors will train Fellows.

Most MDF appointments span the full academic year, allowing Fellows to develop technical expertise, create activities and resources for an upcoming semester, and support implementation of new activities. Depending on the project, Fellows may begin their appointments in early summer to prepare materials for Fall courses.

We welcome inquiries from faculty and departments interested in engaging Media & Design Fellows for their courses, and we also accept applications directly from graduate students who would like to serve as Media & Design Fellows.

The Bok Center’s Media & Design Fellows (MDFs) support innovative course development within the FAS, partnering with faculty and Bok Center staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials, and assignments for undergraduate courses and departments. 

Department/Program-Based Media & Design Fellows support their home department, or a program closely tied to their disciplinary expertise, developing tools and content that are valuable for that department’s undergraduate courses. In accordance with departmental priorities, MDFs may create digital content, assignments, and resources, develop and support new teaching and learning practices, or build course materials, including media (text, video, illustrations, animations, websites) and ways for students to interact with these media. Additionally, MDFs may offer workshops and other forms of guidance to help students complete multimodal assignments.

MDFs also have the opportunity to engage with other instructional support units on campus. Fellows may receive mentorship from the Libraries, Museums, and Academic Technology, among others, developing expertise in tools or media that are relevant for their disciplines. While previous experience with some of these tools and technologies is useful for MDFs, applicable disciplinary background, a thoughtful approach to teaching with new media, and a willingness to learn new tools is all that is required in most cases. Bok staff and other mentors will train Fellows.

The Bok Center’s Media & Design Fellows (MDFs) support innovative course development within the FAS, partnering with faculty and Bok Center staff to design a variety of digital tools, course materials, and assignments for undergraduate courses and departments.

Bok Media & Design Fellows are chosen for their experience with and enthusiasm for teaching and communicating scholarship via a medium or media. Bok MDFs develop projects that draw on this background, as well as the needs of Bok-supported courses. Therefore, MDF projects may include creating digital content, assignments, and resources, developing and supporting new teaching and learning practices, or building course materials. Additionally, Fellows may offer workshops and other forms of guidance to help students complete multimodal assignments.

Bok MDFs also have the opportunity to engage with other instructional support units on campus. Fellows may receive mentorship from the Libraries, Museums, and Academic Technology, among others, developing expertise in tools or media that are relevant for their disciplines. 

The Bok Media & Design Fellows Program is an extension of, but separate from, the department-based Media & Design Fellows Program. Whereas department-based MDFs are linked to a single department, Bok Fellows are based in the Bok Center. Candidates may apply to be considered for both positions but usually will be selected for only one fellowship.
