# day 4

so far
- design the educational way
- inspirations for multimodal communication
    - AV, film, podcasts, etc.
    - graphic/web design and data vis, etc.

today the second take on design
- games
- in pairs, find a game or two and try to learn and play at least a turn or two
    - what are the elements?
    - which map on to the learning experience?
    - which could be made into steps on the way to your capstone project?
