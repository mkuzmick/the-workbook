Designing 
Alternative 
Assignments
A Bok Summer Seminar at the Learning Lab
with Marlon Kuzmick & Christine D'Auria


In the average course, students will spend a large chunk of their time listening, a large chunk of their time reading, and some of their time making things. This seminar is devoted to the making chunk, and, within this chunk, to modes of making that are either newly emergent or overlooked.

Over the course of five sessions in the Bok Centerâ€™s Learning Lab, we will
learn some of the basics of assignment design
experiment with a number of different media and tools, from podcasting to performance to 3D-modeling to photography
design our own assignments and activities that achieve alignment between the students' work and the learning objectives we have in our various disciplinary context . 
By the end of the seminar we should all have a more developed "toolbox" of techniques for designing meaningful learning experiences for the learners in our classes, and perhaps even a more developed sense of where we think higher education and academic communication are headed.

The Tools

For the duration of the seminar you will have the Learning Lab's space and materials at your disposal for designing and testing multimodal activities. Our staff and fellows are there to help you with any technical hurdles you'll face, and even to help by testing out your activities. We will be accumulating notes and links and your insights in a collaborative document we'll work on in HackMD.io.  After this doc, that's where we'll be distributing relevant information for each class meeting.


The Sessions

Monday, June 6: Basics
the basics of assignment design
the example of academic writing
basic terms and concepts: formative & summative assessment, backward design, Bloom's taxonomy, alignment, scaffolding, etc.
what IS an alternative assignment anyway? alternative to what? how?

Wednesday, June 8: Multimodal Storytelling, Process & Product
podcasting, photo and video assignments and the many steps involved in making them

Friday, June 10: Posters, Infographics, Presentations
why spend time on visual design?
and what tools really achieve your objectives?

Monday, June 12: Games & Performances
learning from the worlds of theatre and game design
designing low-stakes in-class activities and higher-stakes performance assignments

Wednesday, June 14: Grading, Responding, Celebrating
giving students feedback
the question of evaluation
final portfolios, events, galleries, and more


The Final Project
If you are completing the seminar for Bok Teaching Certificate credit, we will ask that you submit an assignment prompt accompanied by a rationale explaining how it achieves some of the learning objectives you might have in a course you'd teach in your discipline. For those interested, we will offer you a more detailed prompt in the second week of the seminar, and we will accept submissions until the end of June.
