# ll-microproject-MDF-orientation-intro-onboarding-and-assignment-design

## THE TIMELINE:

August 16th: 9:00-10:30

MAKE THIS DAY INTO 3 1-HOUR CHUNKS
* intro and onboarding (9 - 10)
* assignment design (10 - 11)
* their activity/presentation (11 - 12)

## CHUNKS

**9:00: 9:30: intro to the bok center/mdf program (MK & everyone)**

just give a quick sense of:
* what is bok
    * tamara, laura, caroline, anyone else in the office?
* what are the MDFs
* what are the LLUFs
* what is the studio?
* what are the systems?
* who are we?
* what are alternative assignments - alternative to what? - give arc of the two weeks (to thicken or maybe even abandon this term)


THEN they introduce themselves - activity with some visual on a card - abstract or literal
* name on one side, visualization of their goal, something they're excited about working on this year
* come up to table and guess which one is theirs by picking from visualization side
* my name is __ from dept. and I drew this because
* do this at main table because this really is the homebase
* casey grabs live stills and sharing them in #share-your-moments

this activity is more about them as individuals (less about them as disciplinary experts)

TRANSITION: documentation is central to what we do - this why we're always recording, photographing you 

capturing and sharing our ideas, our work, our goals, our projects - that's the job [laugh]

we built this machine here to do exactly this!

we're going to require a few things - then walkthrough the systems

this activity allowed us to get a sense of a single goal that you have for the year, and the first project we're going to have you work on is a lookbook, which will contain a lot of these types of goals - with rationales that you can use to pitch these ideas to your department!

**9:30 - 10: systems, onboarding, MDF manual (CD/JK/DD)**

the lookbook has a handful of examples (and can include the thing you're super excited about - we can figure out ways to develop a rationale for these that make sense for your departments!)

- we're going to lead you through the systems we use to do our projects by walking through the process of using them to do your work (i.e. a project) over the coming 2 weeks.

- to find this project doc - let's head to your individual google drive folders first! (take them to google drive first to show the lookbook project doc)
- when we look at the footnotes - i jump back in (if you open #share-your-moments now, you'll see that we have a bunch of images in here - this is a space where you can post things as you work through your project)
- dani and cd overview the slack channels a bit



- google drive walkthrough
    - all of you have private folders
    - you will do a number of projects, all listed in plan of the year,
    - but we also have working docs for each project
- the first project is a lookbook
    - we should share the description in show your work as a project we just launched
    - share models and references first in the doc, then in share your ideas.
    - 
* they introduce themselves using these systems 
    * in ll-mdfs - send a giphy of your favorite food to this channel
- studio computer passwords/norms around using LL studio and not using personal slack on studio computers
- slack & google drive
    - private vs public channels
        - private: individual slack channel and google drive folders
        - public: mdf channel, show-yourS and save-yourS
- then they get message in the mdf slack channel with links to: google cals (DD)?


WHEN DO WE GIVE THEM MEDIA RELEASE?

**10 - 10:30: assignment design**
Put all of these handouts into the shared google drive folder!

ALIGNMENT (relates to backward design but a somewhat different take)
* alignment between learning objectives and medium/activity/assignment/tool
* someone has an intuition that this form has something going for it - so deepen understanding of form is something we'd want to do on the way to developing an assignment
* and on other side - deepen our understanding of what the learning objectives are, make sure we account for all of the things we want students to be able to do
* and make sure these two remain in alignment

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY
* what we want to add to Bloom's taxonomy is that there are additional things that you think that matter that students can do or things that you think that matter that you're having trouble articulating, for instance:
    * intervening in the world politically and ethically - where would this fit in Bloom's?
    * how can we create inclusive learning environments?
    * how does the community of the course relate to the world outside?

* How can I design in alignment with this?
* **cards/learning objectives activity here??**

--
* the basics of assignment design (MK)
    * HANDOUT: [formative and summative assessment](https://www.gre.ac.uk/learning-teaching/assessment/assessment/design/formative-vs-summative#:~:text=Formative%20assessments%20have%20low%20stakes,against%20some%20standard%20or%20benchmark.)
    * HANDOUT: Expos "A Brief Guide to Designing Essay Assignments"
        * the academic convention has been to have students display proficiency through writing
        * but a lot of this holds true for multimodal communication as well
    * source mapping/expos stuff
* conventional ways of defining goals for students (CD)
    * HANDOUT: [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)
        * language for learning objectives
        * these are limited but nonetheless useful categories for thinking in broad strokes about what we often want students to be able to do
* backward design and multimodal communications (CD)
    * HANDOUT: backward design - 3 stages one-pager(CD)
        * figure out what you're trying to do
        * then figure out whether what you're assigning achieves that 

things that are just on g-drive
* HANDOUT: [Understanding by Design](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/)
* HANDOUT: multimodal instruction/Richard Mayer (more of a resource for them)
    * students learn best through multimedia
* HANDOUT: FTC resource that Tamara mentioned to MK

**MAYBE THIS IS NOW ON THE NEXT DOC BECAUSE IT'S THE THIRD HOUR?**
ACTIVITY: Let's start by trying to articulate our hopes and dreams by writing down some ideas on cards. Let's break them down into:

learning objectives for our students: things we want them to know or be able to do by the end of a given lesson or course (it's sometimes helpful to take a look at something like Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives for an activity like this)

## IDEAS

## introductions/icebreaker activity

* an icebreaker related to teaching/learning?

Intro Activity: 
* [the adobe creative type quiz](https://mycreativetype.com/): JK
* Post quiz results to slack as LL studio (as secretly as possible) to ll-show-your-work
    * (We will print out cards of all the results and place under overhead along with cards of names)
* Find your favorite color of card.
    * on one side write your name
    * on the other side write your creative type
    * secretly hand to Jordan
* 2 songs to collect objects (found either in the studio, or something that you carry with you, etc.) and 3 cards (one word on each card) to introduce yourself
* under overhead, construct a self portrait in objects to introduce yourself, Include your department, any tools you are particularly excited about, and importantly, any clues for the group to guess your creative type.
* after you introduce yourself, everyone will vote for what type they think you are (if we have time: on a paper "game board" we make? like a chart or field notes type thing they each get?)
* after all introductions, find a small group. prompt: can you find an ideal collaborator? Discuss in your small group how your creative typ might influence your approach to MDF projects and work this year at the LL (or some other paris share/small discussion prompt to get them to learn more about each other's interess/desires/etc.)

    
## history of the bok center/mdf program-MK
* mdfs need to know the harvard context and how the program has emerged (mk)
* get a taste of key ways of thinking that have been core to the program 
    * design thinking prototyping testing
    * multimodal comms
    * experience the fact that it's a mix of all that

* what are they supposed to learn by the end of the two weeks
    * lookbook
        * what is that
        * what are the expectations
* expectations for the year
* expectations for the role

## systems/onboarding overview
*what is the depth of interaction in our system that we want to get fellows into and where is there room to wait or go more in depth with just some folks*
- studio computer passwords/norms around using LL studio and not using personal slack on studio computers
- slack & google drive
    - private vs public channels
        - private: individual slack channel and google drive folders
        - public: mdf channel, show-yourS and save-yourS
- google calendars


## goals

intro:
* get a sense of our systems
* what the year will look like
* what an mdf is

one-pager with key info about systems, slack, etc. - IN THE MANUAL, MAKE THIS IN HACKMD

* alignment between learning objectives and assignments and means of assessment
* start populating the syllabus with these readings (like the seminar - find this syllabus and get the readings together)
    * understanding by design
    * bloomâ€™s taxonomy

* activity where they articulate learning objectives
    * need a mechanic for getting academic articles into their hands (whether they look them up or we give them to them)
    * puzzle through this - what sort of design can we come up with today?
    * walk through it and decide who is comfy with it
    * thicken our sense of what academic comms is
    * justifies alternative assignments that leverages the voacb they're building throughout the day
    * culminates in the 60 second pitch
    * need a bunch of cards indicating what the learning objectives are, what the "Moves" are
    * is any of this allowed to be non-textual?
    * could do a taste of day 2/engaging with the machine?

* want to develop their sense of what academic argument looks like
    * so that they have ways of articulating why they want to go beyond text
    * what it means to know in their discipline

* mdfs need to know the harvard context and how the program has emerged (mk)
* get a taste of key ways of thinking that have been core to the program 
    * design thinking prototyping testing
    * multimodal comms
    * experience the fact that it's a mix of all that
* what are they supposed to learn by the end of the two weeks
    * lookbook
        * what is that
        * what are the expectations
* expectations for the year
* expectations for the role


systems they need to be onboarded onto:
* it really does take time to grasp slack and google doc and drive
* share the calendar on a screen even if we don't have them do anything with it yet
* or embed still image of the calendar in the hackmd syllabus so they can see it and know it's a thing, just to get familiar with way they looked
