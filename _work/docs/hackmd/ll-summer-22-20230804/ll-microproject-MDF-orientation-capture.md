# ll-microproject-MDF-orientation-capture

## TIMELINE

August 16th: 1:30-3:45

## CHUNKS
* photo
* video
* audio

## the plan
### photo (45 m - 1 h) - MK
#### SET UP:
#### LECTURE/DEMO:
* basics of composition, shot length, angle, lighting, etc. and what our decisions for these convey to the audience
* Angles & Keystoning
    * high v. low angle and what they convey
    * keystoning vs no keystoning: how to (the what it conveys will have been covered in the mini lecture)

#### CHALLENGE:
take the perfect portrait!
### video + audio (1 h - 1 h 15 m)
#### SET UP:
- main table set up for lecture/demonstration
- 3 tables, each table has:
    - 2 mics
    - a zoom recorder
    - several pairs of headphones, at least 2.
    - the video stuff...casey add here ;)
- also need their cards from the morning session

#### LECTURE/DEMO:
**video:**

**audio:**
- the basic set up of two mics and a zoom with a set of headphones per person and splitters to get them all out around the table -- will get a couple of volunteers to try out the mics. (each fellow will take their headphones with them for the duration of the session)
- technical learning objectives:
    * understand the key features of the mics we have at the LL, and how to use them
        * how to point shotguns, and how to hide them during shoots while still accomplishing good audio
    * key terms to *maybe* mention: pickup pattern, cardiod, shotgun, dynamic, condenser, high-pass filter, levels
- ok, quick quiz! which type of mic should we use if we want to get try getting a voice over narration in our LL studio if we are one of 3 groups doing a challenge? 


#### CHALLENGE:
**prompt:**
Revist your cards, with the goal of describing them in interesting ways, in ways that reach beyond your intial pitch. The audio goal is to do a VO purposely for the things being captured (aka a narration that goes with the video). Ask questions of each other as you the shoot object in equally interesting ways-the conciet is that this is a documentary of what just happened. Reflect on the card activity, on your ideas, on life itself if you must. Maybe make it campy. 

you will find at the 3 tables, some microphones and some cameras. Take turns so each of you has a chance to record a voice over of your cards for the documentary.

## IDEAS




### idea #1

#### Hour 1: PHOTO & COMPOSITION/SET UP BASICS


* basics of composition, shot length, angle, lighting, etc. and what our decisions for these convey to the audience

* Camera basics
    * a quik tour of our cameras for photography
    * how to format cards
    * where to adjust iso, etc.
    * taking pictures & reviewing shots
* Lenses & Shot Length
    * a quick tour of our lenses
    * try out the shot lengths
* Angles & Keystoning
    * high v. low angle and what they convey
    * keystoning vs no keystoning: how to (the what it conveys will have been covered in the mini lecture)
    * [resource-photographing-2D-objects](https://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/people/casey-c/photographing-2D)
* Lighting
    * the 360 experience
    * softboxes, spots, gels
    * the big board bouncing light thing (will lookup name later)
    * studio lighting


* take the perfect portrait challenge?
    * in pairs or small groups you get
        * a 5D
        * a softbox

#### Hour 2: VIDEO & AUDIO

lecture. 

Audio Group:
* difference betweeo dynamic and shotgun, how to point shotguns, hiding mics during video shoots while still accomplishing good audio
    * do a VO purposely for the things being captured a narration that goes with the video
        * revist your cards, describe in interesting ways, the shoot object in interesting ways-the conciet is that this is a doc of what just happened.maybe make it campy-we need an example because this is definitely a mode of filmmaking.
* [resource-recording-with-mics](https://hackmd.io/nMAoEzyJStm-M5cQeJu1IQ)


Video Group:
* Depth of field/focusing (CD)
    * including rack focusing as a storytelling technique and the “stay in focus challenge,” where one student slowly walks toward the camera while the camera person attempts to keep them in focus (impossibly hard but they liked it!)
    * or rack focus from one person to another at the table, or from mic to person.
* Camera movement (CC)
* capture-an-activity shots
   


#### Idea 2


Or we do more stations as tasters for the first hour, and then the second hour they work in small groups to set up a shoot (like the interview-in-studio-shoot, or setting up some of the smaller studios for shoots[music studio, glass studio, MK's office, Fireplace Room] then these can serve as pop-up studios/confessionals for activities as the orientation proceeds)

Hour 1: taster stations
15 minutes: a super quick intro to the basic concepts

45 minutes: rotate through 5 stations
* angles, shot length, keystoning
* microphones
    * difference betweeo dynamic and shotgun, how to point shotguns, hiding mics during video shoots while still accomplishing good audio
    * do a VO purposely for the things being captured a narration that goes with the video
        * revist your cards, describe in interesting ways, the shoot object in interesting ways-the conciet is that this is a doc of what just happened.maybe make it campy-we need an example because this is definitely a mode of filmmaking.
* camera set up
* lighting set up
* depth of field, racking focus, camera movements

Hour 2: the challenge.

#### Idea 3

PHOTO AND AUDIO together for hour 1

photo capstone: 5Ds and softboxes, take the perfect portrait.



VIDEO hour 2

understanding the machine of the studio better. reframing cameras, focusing, signal flow orientation, getting them to switch something. 

set up a petting zoo verision of the control room for them to gain this competency.

AMX, or Atem Mini os what they will learn-since this is the device they can actually borrow.


prompt: return to your cards and go through them again. can incorporate props if related and appropriate. 

* microphones
    * difference betweeo dynamic and shotgun, how to point shotguns, hiding mics during video shoots while still accomplishing good audio
    * do a VO purposely for the things being captured a narration that goes with the video
        * revist your cards, describe in interesting ways, the shoot object in interesting ways-the conciet is that this is a doc of what just happened.maybe make it campy-we need an example because this is definitely a mode of filmmaking.
