This week I was in the studio for one last day before taking off on vacation. I had to be around to kick off our first official week of summer. Since it was my last day in the studio for a while, I cleaned up the office space a bit, and designed a paper storage system to help keep things organized while I'm away. I hope folks find it useful and enjoyable as a system! I also "wiped" my office, so that the whiteboard and surface areas are ready for my return and the impending spatial planning and visualization prep for Fall!

Over the next few weeks I'll be transitioning to some writing and computer-based work I've been saving up for these summertime remote days that have built up over the year. To help myself prepare for that I also loaded up a drive with some media assets and set up a collection of HackMds so that I can hit the ground running on my first remote day next week.

On Monday, we started to get ready for our Bok summer seminar on alternative assignments, in part by testing a new (awesome!) set up involving the small studio, the rear projector, and some speakers (you can see Casey connecting them in the image here). What this allowed in the context of the seminar was for graduate students to practice "teaching"/assigning their alternative assignments, walking all of us through their rationales for those assignments and why they thought their alternative form was best-suited to address their imagined course's learning goals. 

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03KDGCPLN5/img_0523.jpg?pub_secret=04b761e55f)
Because we knew we had two big events on Friday--our summer seminar and a visit from the Native American High School Program--we wanted to think through the setup of the studio space and, in particular, how we could set up the space optimally for the learning goals of these different events that address different audiences (grads and high school students, respectively). This was a good exercise for me in drafting because as you can see from this image, I was drawing from a particular vantage point in the room. This proved limiting very quickly! Next time, I'll do a bird's eye view, but this was a good exercise in identifying the different components of the studio regardless.

Working with Marlon, Casey, Dani, and Sophie, I built a rack to connect the Blackmagic cameras to converters, recorders, and a switcher. We ended up having to switch from the 4k switcher I initially installed to one of the newer 8ks (because the 4k is too loud!). But this really helped me to understand the different steps involved with getting the studio set up to record an event.

I also learned that it's important to slow down when using power tools--I risked stripping the screws by pressing too firmly on the screwdriver's trigger.

Patience and slowing down achieved! Note the seriousness with which I'm approaching my screwdriving endeavor in this image.

On Wednesday afternoon, Christine and I zoomed with Marlon and we finally got to "writing" the LL sections of the Bok Annual Report. We practiced the workflow of recording a Zoom meeting to get a transcript, which we will then use to draft text. Christine had never recorded a zoom meeting and accessed the transcript so I showed her how to do that. It was really helpful to hear Marlon talk about many of the things that I didn't know anything about it, from before I was a part of the LL and for things that happened earlier in the fall, from before Christine started here. Our plan is to see if Kevin wants to help with turning the transcript into draft sentences, otherwise I'll work on this. I think we also have more than enough material that can be used for additional reporting - including additional Bok news stories and donor reports.

On Thursday, Christine and I built a rack with Marlon and Casey's help. Christine was super helpful in explaining to me what she has recently learned, as I was the uber-beginner. I was surprised at how gentle I could use the drill! We were getting the rack ready for Friday's NAHSP workshop.

On Thursday morning, Marlon, Christine, and I each drew a map of the studio space.

After taking the Bok staff group photo, interested folks ventured down into the LL for optional head shots. The P&P team were all surprised to see the huge projector screen and initially there was some hesitation about having their faces gigantic in front of everyone :) Caroline volunteered to go first and helped convey how fun and cool it really was. Everyone seemed to enjoy this and we even got some people to introduce themselves and say a few things, which Christine can use for her weekly montage and we can save in general for B-Roll/possible goodbye montages!

The green screen & stage was also set up for Bok staff headshots but folks really responded to the small studio. So Christine went and sat down in front of this under-appreciated area and crushed it (even though the video wasn't capturing footage!).

On Friday, I finished up working on my personal reflections for my upcoming performance review meeting with Marlon and Laura. It was nice to take the time to reflect on the past year and put into words how I felt about some of what occurred. 

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03JSFEMUJK/screen_shot_2022-06-10_at_2.47.42_pm.png?pub_secret=856c3d7b3f)
Also on Friday, I continued working on drafting a story about Wesley and Charlie's film dubbing project. I used what Charlie had already written, what Christine wrote in Wesley's project report, and a little bit of what Marlon spoke during our recorded Annual Report writing zoom. I think it's at a place where I can show Christine for edits and help focusing the story, and then maybe we can reach out to Wesley to get a quote. The plan when it's ready is to post it on the Bok website as a news story and then adapt it for the Annual Report, so I also spoke this week with Casey about maybe staging some photos to go with it as well.

I spent the last bit of Friday afternoon chipping away at data cleaning the Events table in the LL Admin Hub base. Events need to be correctly categorized and tagged in different ways so the LL numbers in the annual report correctly capture all of the work that has been done!

made progress on getting access to the SEAS makerspace/machine shop. For now, just the safety training, hopefully next week I'll be able to start the shop training in person.

started to give a fresh thread to the rack units that had problematic attachment points.

identified the bulk of shoots that might need some visual materials for the annual report and with the help of Sophie, Dan, and Dézhawn, started to accumulate images onto Google Drive. 

![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03K7AYLWJF/img_2467.jpg?pub_secret=f6c347889c)

helped build out a fresh studio setup for the NAHSP this afternoon!

Tuesday I spent the morning helping Jessi getting her setup to film her final interivews with marlon.

Wednesday I spent most of the day ingesting footage and watching resolve tutorials.

Thursday I worked from home, and watched a ton of Resolve tutorials. 
Friday I continued ingesting footage, worked on pulling and editing stills from the IBSP event that happened earlier this week. ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03KWNA7BB2/image_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=087f8ce4ff)

Also I added the Harvard logo to all of the David Gooblar Event videos that were on vimeo. This took some time, because I had to re-download, import into FCPX, add the logo, re-export, and finally re-upload back to vimeo. ![alt text](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F03K41UKN21/screen_shot_2022-06-10_at_2.14.02_pm.png?pub_secret=72bbca17d6)
