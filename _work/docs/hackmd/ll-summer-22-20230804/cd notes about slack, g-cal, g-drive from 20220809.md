# cd notes about slack, g-cal, g-drive from 20220809
mdfs need access to:
* ll-menu - but they're consumers of this, can subscribe to this but don't need to add to it
    * what's the appropriate way to train people to look at the menu and use it?
    * tell them how to know what's relevant for them given their skills, projects, etc. 
    * menu isn't just saying come to this but also stay out of this room at this time
    * figure out a way to create sub-menus for MDFs
* ll-plan (some mdfs, not all will need this)
* ll-report this - maybe this the only thing in the mdf manual unless they want to learn about other things
    * mdfs invite report-this to events that get created (including by a prof - invite this cal to that event)


* TBD - ll-media-captured (project by project basis)

Slack:
* individual channels for all mdfs (private)
    * where they share things they don't want everyone to see
* show your work
* save your assets
* all of the show-your and save-your channels (these still being determined/will be developed during the year)
* can get the MDFs on Slack during orientation
    * maybe have this be the way they share with JK their secret personality quiz result?

Google drive:
* other place where mdfs can share work
* everyone gets individual channel
* add templates to their individual folders (anything we'd want them to manipulate - project proposal forms, syllabus; OR a folder that's MDF manual with all of the docs in there so they can read them OR these exist in their individual folders)

Things to determine still:
* where their assets go (drive, slack)
* where to highlight using slack and drive during orientation activities
