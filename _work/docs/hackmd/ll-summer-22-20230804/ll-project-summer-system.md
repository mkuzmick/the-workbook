## Main Tools

Here we will list out the main tools we'll use for the Summer System (and, ultimately, for the 22-23 System), along with the basic plan for the summer and then notes towards 22-23 too.

### Airtable

[summerBase ](https://airtable.com/appBjRJSsYUhy6SQr/tbl2qwzUD7QhDgOCj/viwX3DFY5ntDOEl6s?blocks=hide)

with tables for
    - `Projects`
    - `Actions`
    - `LlReportEvents`
    - `Shoots` or `_SHOOTS`
    - `_PEOPLE`
    - `_TOOLS`
    - `_FORMS`
    - at some point `_EVENTS`
    - 
 
### Google Cal
(right now) We'll invite the google calendar "ll-report" to events that we want to report on. This calendar is syncing to the summerBase. 


(I think this is where we'll be moving) We will create google cal to be Event Types (and each event property will indicate)

event type option ideas (also see [LL Norms](/bTQn-2m1RAq1C7g7vT-a8Q))-
* Planning/Consultation/Meeting
* Workshop/Seminar?
* Media Capture/Recording?

#### conceptualizing calendars
- 2 types:
    - for proactive use (knowing that appointments are happening; populating a standup doc)
    - for retroactive use (reporting on things that happened whether they were scheduled first or not; populating a timeline)

* ll-report - everything we want reported on/so everything (Dani note: things I am leaving off so far - 
    - LL Team meetings
    - summer show and tells
    - annual report writing time
    - bok all staff photo
    - design lab for annual report cover
* ll-shoots - everything we acquire media on
    - should this have separate proactive and retroactive calendars?
* go back to the drawing board on ll-central etc

### work base thoughts

from Aristotle?
- Material cause: "that out of which" it is made. 
    - Medium . . . video + scicomm, say, instead of "explainer video"
- Efficient Cause: the source of the objects principle of change or stability. (People with Tools)
- Formal Cause: the essence of the object. (Form)
    - what sort of thing is this? video project? infographic?
- Final Cause: the end/goal of the object, or what the object is good for. 
    - Project? Client? Learning Objective or Objective or Goal?
    - in a sense, the thick description of the Project should have the Goal within it (the ask)
