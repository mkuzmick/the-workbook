Let me help you design a cost-effective, data-lake-inspired solution for your studio, leveraging your existing tools like Google Drive, Airtable, and custom Python/Node.js scripts. Your goal is to manage a diverse set of data sources—videos, transcripts, edited deliverables, code repos, photos, Google Drive documents, PDFs, Canvas sites, Slack channels, a Drupal website, and Airtable bases—and use them for your website, YouTube tutorials, social media, workshop handouts, pop-up NextJS sites, and AI tools, all without third-party vendor costs. Plus, you have an immediate task of updating your overhauled website systematically. Below, I’ll outline key data-lake-centric design patterns and provide actionable steps tailored to your setup, along with near- and long-term benefits.

### Understanding Data Lakes and Their Relevance
A **data lake** is a centralized repository that stores all your data—structured (like Airtable records) and unstructured (like videos or PDFs)—in its raw form, at any scale. Unlike traditional databases, it doesn’t require upfront structuring, making it ideal for your mix of videos, text, code, and images. It supports analytics, automation, and AI by keeping everything accessible in one place. Since you’re budget-constrained, we’ll adapt this concept using tools you already have, primarily Google Drive for storage and Airtable for organization, with custom scripts to tie it all together.

### Key Data-Lake-Centric Design Patterns
Here are the core patterns we’ll adapt to your needs:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - **What it is**: The process of collecting data from all your sources into the data lake.  
   - **Your context**: You need to pull from Google Drive, Drupal, Airtable, GitHub, Slack, Canvas, etc.  
   - **How to apply**: Use APIs (e.g., Google Drive API, Drupal REST API, Airtable API) or export functions to gather data. For large files like videos, manual uploads or file transfer scripts might be needed initially.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - **What it is**: Storing data efficiently, often in a flat, folder-based structure.  
   - **Your context**: You’re already using Google Drive, which can store all file types.  
   - **How to apply**: Designate a Google Drive folder (e.g., `/data_lake`) as your data lake, with subfolders like `/videos`, `/documents/tutorials`, `/drupal_content`, etc.

3. **Data Cataloging and Metadata Management**  
   - **What it is**: Tracking what data exists, where it is, and details about it (metadata).  
   - **Your context**: Airtable already links to some external data and can serve as your catalog.  
   - **How to apply**: Build an Airtable base with records for each asset, including links to Google Drive files, metadata (e.g., title, tags, date), and status (e.g., draft, published).

4. **Data Processing and Transformation**  
   - **What it is**: Converting raw data into usable formats for specific outputs (e.g., website pages, AI inputs).  
   - **Your context**: You need text from PDFs, HTML from docs, or video metadata for YouTube.  
   - **How to apply**: Write Python scripts (e.g., using PyPDF2 for PDFs) or Node.js apps to process data as needed.

5. **Data Access and Querying**  
   - **What it is**: Enabling search and retrieval of data for various uses.  
   - **Your context**: Staff and AI tools need to find content easily.  
   - **How to apply**: Use Airtable’s API for metadata queries and simple search scripts (e.g., with Python’s Whoosh) for text content.

6. **Data Governance and Security**  
   - **What it is**: Controlling access and ensuring data integrity.  
   - **Your context**: Some data is sensitive; team access varies.  
   - **How to apply**: Leverage Google Drive’s sharing settings and Airtable’s permission controls.

### Steps to Roll Your Own Data Lake
Here’s a practical plan to build this with your tools (Google Drive, Airtable, Python/Node.js), starting with your immediate website task and scaling to other needs:

#### Step 1: Choose and Set Up Storage
- **Action**: Use Google Drive as your data lake storage since it’s part of your Google Workspace and handles all file types.
- **Implementation**: Create a folder structure like:
  ```
  /data_lake
    /videos
      /raw
      /edited
    /transcripts
    /documents
      /tutorials
      /research_articles
      /web_content
    /photos
    /code
    /drupal
  ```
- **Why**: Keeps data organized and leverages existing storage without extra cost.

#### Step 2: Ingest Data (Starting with Website and Google Drive)
- **Action**: Scrape your Drupal website and index Google Drive folders.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Drupal**: Use Drupal’s REST API (check your version’s docs) with Python (`requests` library) to fetch page content. Example:
    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://your-site.com/api/node/page', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    pages = response.json()
    ```
  - **Google Drive**: Use the Google Drive API (via `google-api-python-client`) to list files and metadata:
    ```python
    from googleapiclient.discovery import build
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=your_creds)
    files = service.files().list().execute()
    ```
  - Store files or links in `/data_lake/drupal` and `/data_lake/documents`.
- **Why**: Focuses on your immediate need (website content) and best-quality text sources, aligning with long-term ingestion goals.

#### Step 3: Catalog Data in Airtable
- **Action**: Build an Airtable base to map all content.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a table with fields like:
    - Asset ID (auto-number)
    - Type (e.g., video, document)
    - Title
    - Description
    - Tags (e.g., “tutorial”, “website”)
    - Creation Date
    - Author
    - Source (e.g., Google Drive, Drupal)
    - Link (URL to file/page)
    - Status (e.g., draft, outdated)
  - Use the Airtable API to populate it programmatically:
    ```python
    from airtable import Airtable
    airtable = Airtable('base_id', 'table_name', 'api_key')
    airtable.insert({'Title': 'Tutorial 1', 'Link': 'drive.google.com/xyz', 'Tags': ['website']})
    ```
- **Why**: Provides a searchable, improvable map of your data lake.

#### Step 4: Process Data for the Website
- **Action**: Identify and update outdated content, then publish it.
- **Implementation**:
  - Query Airtable for Drupal and web_content assets.
  - Flag outdated items manually or with rules (e.g., pre-overhaul dates).
  - Update files in Google Drive, then sync metadata in Airtable.
  - Convert docs to HTML (e.g., using Python’s `pandoc` or Node.js libraries) and push to Drupal via its API:
    ```python
    requests.post('https://your-site.com/api/node/page', json={'title': 'New Tip', 'body': html_content}, auth=('user', 'pass'))
    ```
- **Why**: Systematically rebuilds your website from the data lake.

#### Step 5: Build Publishing Pipelines
- **Action**: Automate content delivery to other platforms.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Website**: Script to publish “web_content” tagged items to Drupal.
  - **YouTube**: Upload videos from `/videos/edited` using YouTube API, pulling descriptions from Airtable.
  - **Social Media**: Generate posts from “tips” tagged docs using Node.js.
  - **Handouts/NextJS**: Export processed content as PDFs or JSON.
- **Why**: Extends the system beyond the website efficiently.

#### Step 6: Establish Maintenance Workflows
- **Action**: Ensure new content integrates seamlessly.
- **Implementation**:
  - When creating a video or doc, upload it to `/data_lake`, add an Airtable record with tags, and let scripts handle publishing.
  - Example: Tag a doc “tutorial, website” to trigger updates.
- **Why**: Makes the system sustainable with minimal ongoing effort.

#### Step 7: Enable AI Use (Future-Proofing)
- **Action**: Prepare data for AI tools.
- **Implementation**: Later, add a search API or preprocess data into a format (e.g., JSON) for AI agents to query via Airtable or Drive.
- **Why**: Supports your long-term AI goals.
