### Understanding Data-Lake-Centric Design
A data lake is a centralized repository that stores all your data in its raw format, allowing for flexible processing and analysis later. For your studio, this means collecting videos, transcripts, photos, documents, and more into one place, which you can then use for various purposes like updating your website or creating content for YouTube and social media. Given your budget constraints, building this with Node.js and Python, and leveraging Airtable, is a practical approach.

### Steps to Roll Your Own Data Lake
Hereâ€™s a clear path to get started:
- **Set Up Storage:** Choose a scalable storage solution like cloud object storage (e.g., Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) or a self-hosted option like MinIO. Organize data into zones: raw for initial storage, curated for processed data, and consumption for application-ready data.
- **Ingest Data:** Use scripts to collect data from all sources. For example, scrape your drupal website using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, and use the Google Drive API to download documents.
- **Manage with Airtable:** Use Airtable to create a metadata catalog, linking each data asset (e.g., a video or document) to its location in the data lake, and track its status (current, needs review, etc.).
- **Process and Use:** Transform raw data into usable formats (e.g., convert documents to Markdown), and build applications like your NextJS website to fetch content from Airtable or the data lake directly.

### Immediate Task: Website Update
For your immediate need to rebuild the website after removing outdated content, start by:
- Scraping your current website to extract all pages and store them in the raw zone.
- Downloading relevant Google Drive folders, processing their text content, and storing it in the curated zone.
- Use Airtable to review and update content status, then generate the website from current content, ensuring a systematic approach rather than fixing issues one by one.

This method not only addresses your current needs but also sets a foundation for future uses, like AI-driven slackbots for staff and students, which is an unexpected but valuable extension.

This note provides a comprehensive guide to implementing a data-lake-centric architecture for your media studio, leveraging your existing toolset of Node.js, Python, and Airtable, while addressing your immediate task of updating your website and planning for long-term data utilization. Given your diverse data sources and budget constraints, this approach ensures scalability, efficiency, and alignment with your goals for website updates, video tutorials, social posts, handouts, pop-up NextJS sites, and AI tool integration.

#### Background and Context
Your studio handles a wide array of data sources, including large quantities of video from shoots, AI-generated transcripts, edited deliverables with XMLs, code from GitHub repositories, photos, Google Drive folders with documents and PDFs, Canvas websites, Slack content, a drupal website, and Airtable bases with structured content and external references. The primary goals are to harness this data for updating your website, creating video tutorials for YouTube, generating social posts, producing handouts for workshops, building pop-up NextJS sites, and supporting AI tools like slackbots for staff, clients, and students. With no budget for expensive third-party vendors, you aim to develop custom workflows and code, using Airtable as a continuously improvable map of content.

Your immediate task is to rebuild your website following an overhaul that removed outdated content, often with minor inaccuracies. Rather than fixing issues one by one, you seek a systematic approach, starting with scraping your website and Google Drive folders, using the data lake concept as a reference point. This initial data collection will require manual staff time, and you want to articulate both near-term and long-term benefits.

#### Data Lake Design Patterns: Key Concepts
Data lakes are centralized repositories that store data in its raw format, allowing for later processing and analysis without predefined schemas, unlike traditional databases. Design patterns for data lakes, as outlined in various resources ([Data Lake Design Patterns on Medium](https://medium.com/data-ops/the-data-lake-is-a-design-pattern-888323323c66), [Best Practices for Building a Data Lake on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/best-practices-building-data-lake-for-games/data-lake-design-patterns-and-principles.html)), often involve organizing data into zones based on processing stages:

- **Raw Zone:** Stores data as ingested, in its original format, ensuring no loss of information.
- **Curated Zone:** Contains processed, cleaned, and transformed data, ready for specific uses.
- **Consumption Zone:** Holds data formatted for direct use by applications, such as websites or AI models.

Common patterns include zone-based designs, simple setups using object storage and cataloging, and more sophisticated architectures for large-scale analytics. Given your toolset, you can adapt these patterns using open-source tools and cloud storage, focusing on scalability and cost-effectiveness.

#### Steps to Implement Your Data Lake

##### 1. Storage System Setup
Select a storage solution that can handle diverse data types (videos, documents, photos, etc.). Options include:
- Cloud object storage like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability.
- Self-hosted solutions like MinIO, an open-source S3-compatible server, for cost control.

Organize storage into directories reflecting the zone-based pattern:
- `raw/` for initial data ingestion.
- `curated/` for processed data.
- `consumption/` for application-ready outputs.

Given your studio's likely access to IT infrastructure at Harvard, cloud storage may be preferable for scalability, but ensure cost aligns with your budget.

##### 2. Data Ingestion from Sources
Ingest data from each source into the raw zone, using appropriate tools and APIs:
- **Videos, Transcripts, and Deliverables:** Use rsync or similar tools to upload files to storage, organizing by date, event, or category.
- **GitHub Repositories:** Use the GitHub API to clone public and private repositories, ensuring access credentials for private ones.
- **Photos:** Upload to storage, categorizing as needed.
- **Google Drive Folders:** Use the Google Drive API to list and download files, exporting Google Docs as text or HTML.
- **Canvas Websites:** Extract data via Canvas API, including course materials and assignments.
- **Slack Content:** Use Slack API to download messages and files, storing in raw format.
- **Drupal Website:** Crawl using web scraping tools like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup, handling authentication if needed.
- **Airtable Bases:** Export data using Airtable API, storing structured content in raw zone.

This step will require initial manual effort to set up scripts, but automation can reduce future workload.

##### 3. Metadata Management with Airtable
Use Airtable as a metadata catalog to track and manage data assets. Create tables for each data type, with fields like:
- Title, Description, File Path (linking to data lake), Last Updated Date, Status (Current, Needs Review, Outdated).

For example:
| Data Type   | Table Name       | Key Fields                          |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Website Pages | Website Content | Title, URL, Content, Last Updated   |
| Google Docs  | Client Tutorials| Title, File Path, Status, Category  |
| Videos       | Video Shoots    | Title, Date, Path, Transcript Link  |

Link each record to its file in the data lake, enabling easy access and management. Airtable serves as a central hub, continuously improvable as you refine content.

##### 4. Data Processing and Curation
Process raw data to create curated content, stored in the curated zone:
- For website pages, parse HTML to extract text, converting to Markdown for standardization.
- For Google Drive documents and PDFs, use libraries like PyPDF2 for text extraction, converting to text or Markdown.
- For videos and transcripts, index transcripts for searchability, linking to video files.
- Use NLP techniques or simple parsing to identify outdated content (e.g., extract dates, compare with current date).

Staff can review curated content, updating status in Airtable, ensuring accuracy for applications.

##### 5. Building Applications
Develop applications that consume data from the curated zone via Airtable or directly:
- **Website Update:** For your NextJS website, fetch content from Airtable or generate static pages from curated Markdown files. To optimize, periodically sync Airtable data to a local database for the website, reducing API calls.
- **Video Tutorials:** Select videos and transcripts from the data lake, edit using existing tools, and upload to YouTube, referencing Airtable for metadata.
- **Social Posts:** Write scripts to generate posts from curated content, using templates or AI summaries for quick tips and case studies.
- **Handouts for Workshops:** Compile relevant text into PDFs, using data lake content.
- **Pop-up NextJS Sites:** Build sites by fetching chunks of content from Airtable, tailored for events or audiences.
- **AI Tools:** Provide access to curated text for training models or powering slackbots, ensuring data is in AI-friendly formats like plain text.

##### 6. Enhancing with Search Capabilities
Set up a search engine like Elasticsearch to index curated content, enabling quick searches across all data. Use Python or Node.js clients to interact, improving efficiency for staff and AI tools.

#### Immediate Task: Systematic Website Update
Given your website overhaul removed outdated content, follow these steps:
1. **Scrape Current Website:** Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to crawl your drupal website, extracting all pages. Store HTML in `raw/website/`, noting URLs and metadata.
2. **Download Google Drive Folders:** Use Google Drive API to download folders with text content (tutorials, web drafts, research articles). Store in `raw/google_drive/`, preserving folder structure.
3. **Process Text Content:** Parse website HTML to extract text, convert to Markdown, and store in `curated/website_content/`. For Google Drive files, extract text, converting to Markdown, and store in `curated/google_drive_docs/`.
4. **Manage with Airtable:** Create records for each curated item, including status. Staff review content, updating status (e.g., "Needs Review" to "Current").
5. **Generate Website:** Write a script to generate NextJS pages from current content in Airtable, deploying as a static site for efficiency. Ensure navigation and structure align with your design.

This systematic approach prevents band-aid fixes, ensuring all content is reviewed and up-to-date.

#### Benefits: Near-Term and Long-Term
- **Near-Term:** Systematic website update reduces errors, saves staff time, and ensures accuracy. Initial manual effort in scraping and reviewing pays off with a robust content base.
- **Long-Term:** Data lake supports scalability, enabling new applications like AI-driven slackbots, video tutorials, and social posts. Centralized storage enhances collaboration, and Airtable's flexibility allows continuous improvement.

#### Considerations and Challenges
