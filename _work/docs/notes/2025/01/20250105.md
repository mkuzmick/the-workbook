## timelines

- [material ui timeline](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/)

- [react vertical timeline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vertical-timeline-component)

- [aceternity timeline]
(https://ui.aceternity.com/components/timeline)


## reflections

- shadcn definitely seems the way to go
- next up let's just integrate every single one of the components in a sample page
- also use the key aceternity components too
