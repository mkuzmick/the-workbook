# 20241231 notes

who knows if this is the right spot to put everything. but we are running out of time.

insofar as much of this can be a work-in-public project, I don't think we need to worry about pushing all md files to github. Just write with this in mind.

that said, we will for sure create the ability to have a local work folder of some sort that doesn't get committed.

and then, of course, the option of going with a user acct (initially just hooking in to their g drive).
