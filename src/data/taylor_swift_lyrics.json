I don't know what to think\" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said \"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\" Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",

You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter Oh-oh, oh And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause it's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said, \"I'll never leave you alone\" (Oh) You said, \"I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine\" Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you believe it?

And they said, \"Speak now\" Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when you're out Of the church, at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow) Your time is running out And they said, \"Speak now\" Ooh (Run away now), la Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh I hear the preacher say \"Speak now or forever hold your peace\" There's the silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I'm only lookin' at you But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha So, don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out You need to hear me out They said, \"Speak now\" And you say, \"Let's run away now (Run away now) I'll meet you when I'm out Of my tux, at the back door Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow) So glad you were around When they said, 'Speak now'\"",

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda known Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said \"Run as fast as you can\" The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so? I shoulda known You are an expert at \"Sorry\" and keepin' lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town Oh The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

You, with your switching sides And your wildfire lies and your humiliation You have pointed out my flaws again As if I don't already see them I walk with my head down, trying to block you out 'Cause I'll never impress you I just wanna feel okay again I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road And you don't know what you don't know And I can see you years from now in a bar Talking over a football game With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening Washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing But all you are is mean All you are is mean And a liar, and pathetic And alone in life, and mean And mean, and mean, and mean But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me Why you gotta be so mean?

Yeah I don't know what to say since the twist of fate When it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now Next chapter How'd we end up this way? See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy And you're doin' your best to avoid me I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here But you held your pride like you should've held me Oh, I'm scared to see the ending Why are we pretending this is nothin'? I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud This is looking like a contest Of who can act like they care less But I liked it better when you were on my side The battle's in your hands now But I would lay my armor down If you said you'd rather love than fight So many things that you wish I knew But the story of us might be ending soon Like it's killin' me? Yeah And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate When it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now And we're not speakin' I don't know what to say since the twist of fate 'Cause we're goin' down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now The end",

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now, I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say \"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you\" All I know is I was enchanted to meet you I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh) Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh) I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you) Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else) Wonderin' if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please, don't be in love with someone else Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you",

Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please, tell 'em my name Tell 'em how the crowds went wild Tell 'em how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with you Long, long live the walls we crashed through How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you And I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\" And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid Singing, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\" I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you And long, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders",

She won't lose herself in love the way that I did 'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place When Emma falls in love, I'm learning Emma met a boy with eyes like a man Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand Now he'll be her shelter when it rains Little does he know, his whole world's about to change Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her",

And what do you do When the one who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show? You should've been here And I would've been so happy With no one to impress And they're all standin' around me, singin' \"Happy birthday to you\" But there was one thing missin' (Oh) Oh, I knew (Oh) You called me later And said, \"I'm sorry I didn't make it\" And I said, \"I'm sorry too\" And that was the moment I knew",

I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy And I bet you think about me I bet you think about me, yes I bet you think about me Oh, block it all out The voices so loud, sayin' \"Why did you let her go?\" Does it make you feel sad That the love that you're lookin' for Is the love that you had? Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul Scared not to be hip, scared to get old Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me But now that we're done and it's over I bet it's hard to believe But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave And, yeah, I bet you think about me I bet you think about me when you're out At your cool indie music concerts every week I bet you think about me in your house With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch I bet you think about me when you say \"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me\" I bet you think about me",

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin' in a party bathroom Some actress askin' me what happened, you That's what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come And he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\" Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes \"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\" From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? 'Cause in this city's barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? Just between us, do you remember it all too well? Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it (All too well) Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it",

Looking at it now Last December (Last December) We were built to fall apart And fall back together (Back together) Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck The night we couldn't quite forget When we decided, we decided To move the furniture so we could dance Baby, like we stood a chance Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying And I remember thinkin' Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? Remember when you hit the brakes too soon? Twenty stitches in the hospital room When you started crying, baby, I did too But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you Remember when we couldn't take the heat? I walked out, I said, \"I'm settin' you free\" But the monsters turned out to be just trees When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?) (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?) I remember (Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?) (Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Truth is, I can't pretend it's Platonic, it's just ended, so I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest) Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left) I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost) And what it cost, now that we don't talk I don't have to pretend I like acid rock Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht With important men who think important thoughts Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk And the only way back to my dignity Was to turn into a shrouded mystery Just like I had been when you were chasing me Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk",

And I can go anywhere I want Anywhere I want, just not home And you can aim for my heart, go for blood But you would still miss me in your bones And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky) And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies) I didn't have it in myself to go with grace And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same Cursing my name, wishing I stayed You turned into your worst fears And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain Crossing out the good years And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet",

Will you love me? Will you kiss me on the porch In front of all your stupid friends? If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?

When did all our lessons start to look like weapons Pointed at my deepest hurt? I hope she'll be a beautiful fool Who takes my spot next to you No, I didn't mean that Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury You haven't met the new me yet There'll be happiness after me But there was happiness because of me Both of these things, I believe There is happiness In our history, across our great divide There is a glorious sunrise Dappled with the flickers of light From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind And there is happiness I can't make it go away by making you a villain I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven And I pulled your body into mine Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties No one teaches you what to do When a good man hurts you And you know you hurt him too Honey, when I'm above the trees I see it for what it is But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head After giving you the best I had Tell me what to give after that All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness You haven't met the new me yet And I think she'll give you that There'll be happiness after you But there was happiness because of you too Both of these things can be true From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind Oh, leave it all behind Leave it all behind",

The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down The question pounds my head What's a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge But you were too polite to leave me? And do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care? 'Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line by the gold clock Did I leave you hanging every single day? Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey? A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name I'm on a bench in Coney Island Wondering, where did my baby go?

Crescent moon, coast is clear Spring breaks loose, but so does fear He's gonna burn this house to the ground How's one to know? I'd live and die for moments that we stole On begged and borrowed time So tell me to run Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become And drink my husband's wine And now I'm covered in you And I'm covered in you So yeah, it's a fire It's a goddamn blaze in the dark And you started it You started it So yeah, it's a war It's the goddamn fight of my life And you started it You started it Oh, I can't And now I'm covered In you, in you Now I'm covered in you In you",

To be certain we'll be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days I'm on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross? And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now) I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now) In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?) I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again) (If you think of all the cost) It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost) To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days) (Or the violence of the dog days) (Out on waves, being tossed) (I'm on waves, out being tossed) But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?) You were there And I was catchin' my breath Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step And I couldn't be sure I had a feeling so peculiar This pain wouldn't be for Evermore Evermore (Evermore) Evermore (Evermore) This pain wouldn't be for evermore Evermore",

(A tale as old as time) I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning (For the last time) It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime, everybody agrees I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out \"She's laughing up at us from Hell\" I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees It's me, hi (Hi) I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees) I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror",

Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too? Then what did you do? Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh When she said it was too much? Do you wish you could still touch her? It's just a question Half-moon eyes, bad surprise Did you realize out of time? She was on your mind with some dickhead guy That you saw that night But you were on somethin' It was one drink after another Fuckin' politics and gender roles And you're not sure and I don't know Got swept away in the gray I just may like to have a conversation Does it feel like everything's just like Second best after that meteor strike? And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her? That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable And right, but tonight Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?) Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room) And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you) But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?

Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? Storm coming, good husband Bad omen Dragged my feet right down the aisle At the house lonely, good money I'd pay if you'd just know me Seemed like the right thing at the time You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love The slowest way is never loving them enough Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th? Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life? Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love The slowest way is never loving them enough High infidelity Put on your records and regret meeting me I bent the truth too far tonight Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love And it's never enough, it's never enough I didn't know you were keeping count But, oh, you were keeping count",

And who's gonna hold you like me? And who's gonna know you, if not me? I laughed in your face and said \"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots\" And who's gonna hold you like me? Nobody No-fucking-body Nobody You smoked, then ate seven bars of chocolate We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist I scratch your head, you fall asleep Like a tattooed golden retriever But you awaken with dread Pounding nails in your head But I've read this one where you come undone I chose this cyclone with you And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?) And who's gonna know you like me? (Who's gonna know you?) I laughed in your face and said And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?) No-fucking-body (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?) Nobody (Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?) Nobody Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be 'Cause we're crazy So tell me, who else is gonna know me? At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger And put it on the one people put wedding rings on And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding Who's gonna hold you? (Who?) Me Who's gonna know you? (Who?) Me And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you? Straight from the tortured poets department Who else decodes you?",

And, no, you can't come to the wedding I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want I'll tell you something right now You ain't gotta pray for me Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy (He was chaos, he was revelry) If all you want is gray for me Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice Screamin', \"But, Daddy, I love him\" I'm having his baby No, I'm not But you should see your faces But, oh my God, you should see your faces (He was chaos, he was revelry) (He was chaos, he was revelry)",

I keep these longings locked In lowercase, inside a vault Someone told me, \"There's no such thing as bad thoughts Only your actions talk\" These fatal fantasies Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me We've already done it in my head If it's make-believe Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow? Oh, what a way to die My bed sheets are ablaze I've screamed his name Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave Without ever touchin' his skin What if I roll the stone away? They're gonna crucify me anyway What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy? If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly I choose you and me religiously He sent me \"Downtown Lights\" I hadn't heard it in a while Am I allowed to cry?",

Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity I pledged and I still mean it Old habits die screaming Six weeks of breathin' clean air I still miss the smoke Were you makin' fun of me With some esoteric joke? Now I wanna sell my house And set fire to all my clothes And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons Even if I die screaming And I hope you hear it And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog When someone plays \"The Starting Line\" And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming 'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin' I still can't believe it 'Cause old habits die screaming",

Could it be enough to just float in your orbit? Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses? Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be It just didn't happen So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart Say you loved me And if you wanna tear my world apart Say you'll always wonder 'Cause I wonder Will I always Will I always wonder?",

What if happiness came in a cardboard box? Then I think there is something we all forgot What would happen if presents all went away? Tell me, what would you find?

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known What I thought it would be But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free All that I wanted was to be wanted I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing With them, I have something, something to cling to I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts",
